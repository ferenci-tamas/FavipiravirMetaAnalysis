TI  - Favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 in elderly patients-what do we know after 2 years of COVID-19?
T2  - GEROSCIENCE
AB  - Since the appearance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), numerous studies have been conducted to find effective therapeutics. Favipiravir (FVP) is one of the repurposed drugs which has been authorized in a few countries on an emergency basis to treat COVID-19. Elderly individuals especially 65 years or older are more prone to develop severe illness. We aim to provide a short summary of the current knowledge of the antiviral efficacy of favipiravir with respect to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected elderly patients. We found that it is rather controversial whether favipiravir is effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data regarding patients 65 years or older is not sufficient to support or reject the usage of favipiravir for COVD-19 treatment. Further studies would be advisable to elicit the efficiency of favipiravir in elderly COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Antiviral Agent Therapy Optimization in Special Populations of COVID-19 Patients
T2  - DRUG DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND THERAPY
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a global outbreak of disease. The antiviral treatment acts as one of the most important means of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Alteration of physiological characteristics in special populations may lead to the change in drug pharmacokinetics, which may result in treatment failure or increased adverse drug reactions. Some potential drugs have shown antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2 infections, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, interferon alpha, and remedsivir. Here, we reviewed the literature on clinical effects in COVID-19 patients of these antiviral agents and provided the potential antiviral agent options for pregnant women, elderly patients, liver or renal dysfunction patients, and severe or critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy or ECMO after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Therapeutic dilemmas in addressing SARS-CoV-2 infection: Favipiravir versus Remdesivir
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents an unmet clinical need, due to a high mortality rate, rapid mutation rate in the virus, increased chances of reinfection, lack of effectiveness of repurposed drugs and economic damage. COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for effective molecules. Clinically proven efficacy and safety profiles have made favipiravir (FVP) and remdesivir (RDV) promising therapeutic options for use against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Even though both are prodrug molecules with an antiviral role based on a similar mechanism of action, differences in pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and pharmacotoxicological mechanisms have been identified. The present study aims to provide a comprehensive comparative assessment of FVP and RDV against SARS-CoV-2 infections, by centralizing medical data provided by significant literature and authorized clinical trials, focusing on the importance of a better understanding of the interactions between drug molecules and infectious agents in order to improve the global management of COVID-19 patients and to reduce the risk of antiviral resistance.

T2  - THERANOSTICS
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently become a pandemic. As the sudden emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is endangering global health and the economy, the development of strategies to contain the virus?s spread are urgently needed. At present, various diagnostic kits to test for SARS-CoV-2 are available for use to initiate appropriate treatment faster and to limit further spread of the virus. Several drugs have demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 or potential clinical benefits. In addition, institutions and companies worldwide are working tirelessly to develop treatments and vaccines against COVID-19. However, no drug or vaccine has yet been specifically approved for COVID-19. Given the urgency of the outbreak, we focus here on recent advances in the diagnostics, treatment, and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to guide strategies to address the current COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Clinical Trials of Repurposed Antivirals for SARS-CoV-2
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has prompted the repurposing of drugs on the basis of promising in vitro and therapeutic results with other human coronavirus diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). These repurposed drugs have mainly included remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin, interferons, and hydroxychloroquine. Unfortunately, the first open-label, randomized, controlled trials are showing poor efficacy of these repurposed drugs. These results highlight the necessity of identifying and characterizing specific and potent SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.

TI  - The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comprehensive Review of Taxonomy, Genetics, Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Control
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - A pneumonia outbreak with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019, associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The causative agent of the outbreak was identified by the WHO as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), producing the disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The virus is closely related (96.3%) to bat coronavirus RaTG13, based on phylogenetic analysis. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed even from asymptomatic carriers. The virus has spread to at least 200 countries, and more than 1,700,000 confirmed cases and 111,600 deaths have been recorded, with massive global increases in the number of cases daily. Therefore, the WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, and chest pain with pneumonia in severe cases. In the beginning, the world public health authorities tried to eradicate the disease in China through quarantine but are now transitioning to prevention strategies worldwide to delay its spread. To date, there are no available vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs to treat the virus. There are many knowledge gaps about the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, leading to misinformation. Therefore, in this review, we provide recent information about the COVID-19 pandemic. This review also provides insights for the control of pathogenic infections in humans such as SARS-CoV-2 infection and future spillovers.

TI  - Acute Gouty Arthritis During Favipiravir Treatment for Coronavirus Disease 2019
T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - A 42-year-old man exhibiting hypoxia was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. He had medical histories of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, and gout attack. He received favipiravir for compassionate use for 14 days. Subsequently, he showed increased uric acid levels and developed acute gouty arthritis. Favipiravir may induce not only hyperuricemia but also acute gouty arthritis. It should therefore be used with caution in patients with a history of gout and those with hyperuricemia, especially when used at a higher dose and for a longer duration than is typical.

TI  - Diagnostic approaches and potential therapeutic options for coronavirus disease 2019
T2  - NEW MICROBES AND NEW INFECTIONS
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city of China in late December 2019 and identified as a novel coronavirus. Due to its contagious nature, the virus spreads rapidly and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The global tally of COVID-19 was 28 million in early September 2020. The fears and stress associated with SARS-CoV-2 has demolished the socio-economic status worldwide. Researchers are trying to identify treatments, especially antiviral drugs and/or vaccines, that could potentially control the viral spread and manage the ongoing unprecedented global crisis. To date, more than 300 clinical trials have been conducted on various antiviral drugs, and immunomodulators are being evaluated at various stages of COVID-19. This review aims to collect and summarize a list of drugs used to treat COVID-19, including dexamethasone, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, tociluzimab, nitazoxanide and ivermectin. However, some of these drugs are not effective and their use has been suspended by WHO. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Antiviral drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection triggering the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic
T2  - TZU CHI MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - So far, lots of analyses have been conducted to invent the appropriate therapeutic targets for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The category and the strategies for treating the virus are described in this review together with mentioning some specific drugs. Of them, saikosaponin possesses affinity of the drug toward nonstructural protein 15 and the spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. The nucleotide inhibitors such as sofosbuvir, ribavirin, galidesivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, cefuroxime, tenofovir, and hydroxychloroquine (HCHL), setrobuvir, YAK, and IDX-184 were found to be effective in binding to SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. From the antimalarial and anti-inflammatory category, chloroquine and its derivative HCHL have already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The other drugs such as favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir under the antiviral category, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors), remdesivir (RNA polymerase inhibitor) from antiviral category, cepharanthine from anti-inflammatory category, etc., have been pointed based on the previous literature published. Besides, the assessment of the drug repositioning candidates with the related targets is also significant for the viral mitigation.

AB  - Purpose of review Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and potentially lethal pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No specific antiviral treatment is currently available. The purpose of this review is to highlight the main repurposed drug treatments with in-vitro or in-vivo efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2. Recent findings Recent clinical trials suggested remdesivir, IFN-beta-1b and favipiravir have potential clinical and/or virological benefits on patients with COVID-19. Short course of stress dose of corticosteroids might be used as adjunctive treatment to patients who are late presenters with cytokine storm. Convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients with high neutralizing antibody might also be beneficial in the treatment of severe disease. Early effective antiviral therapy in COVID-19 patients will suppress the SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Adjunctive therapy with corticosteroid and convalescent plasma might further ameliorate the cytokine response. Further randomized clinical trials of combination therapy are needed.

T2  - CEN CASE REPORTS
AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) caused a pandemic that first discovered in Wuhan, China. While 10% of the patients have asymptomatic infection, 15-20% have lung involvement, 5-10% have multiple organ failure, and macrophage activation syndrome. Chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cancer are risk factors for mortality. Prognosis or optimal treatment strategy for renal transplant recipients in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unknown. Besides fatal cases, there were also milder case reports. In addition, COVID-19 treatment and the maintenance immunosuppression strategy is still under debate. Antiviral therapies and drug interactions are special topics for these patients. To the best of our knowledge, favipiravir and anti-cytokine treatments have not been previously reported in a kidney transplant recipient with SARS-CoV-2 infection before. We report a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a kidney transplant recipient with fatal outcomes.

TI  - Characteristic Features of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: Attention to the Management and Control in Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
AB  - In the late of 2019, unfamiliar cases of pneumonia were announced in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China that resulted in high mortality rates of 2%. Shortly, these cases were reported to be brought about by a novel type of coronaviruses named as novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by this novel virus is designated as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Instantly afterwards, this disease exhibited an extreme spreading rate and the infection has geographically shifted to affect the whole world including the Middle East countries involving Egypt. Thus, it is not surprising that a lot of reports and literature have been directed to provide information and describe the clinical features of this pandemic. In this report, we describe in details the characteristic features of COVID-19 pandemic with attention to the management and control in Egypt. Characters of the virus, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are fully described.

TI  - Favipiravir in Therapy of Viral Infections
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Favipiravir (FPV) is a novel antiviral drug acting as a competitive inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), preventing viral transcription and replication. FPV was approved in Japan in 2014 for therapy of influenza unresponsive to standard antiviral therapies. FPV was also used in the therapy of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetic parameters, toxicity, and adverse effects of FPV, as well as clinical studies evaluating the use of FPV in the therapy of influenza virus (IV) infection, EVD, and SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with its effectiveness in treating other human RNA infections.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly developed into a global pandemic. The disease has affected not only health care systems and economies worldwide but has also changed the lifestyles and habits of the majority of the world's population. Among the potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 therapy, the viral spike glycoprotein has been studied most intensely, due to its key role in mediating viral entry into target cells and inducing a protective antibody response in infected individuals. In the present manuscript the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for SARS-CoV-2 infection are described and a progress report on the status of SARS-CoV-2 research is provided. A brief review of the clinical symptoms of the condition and current diagnostic methods and treatment plans for SARS-CoV-2 are also presented and the progress of preclinical research into medical intervention against SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed.

TI  - Effective drugs used to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection and the current status of vaccines
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a causal factor of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Drug repurposing, portraying patented drugs as a successful drug development technique, could shorten the period and minimize costs relative to de novo drug exploration. Recently several drugs have been used as anti-SARS-CoV-2 such as Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Nafamostat mesylate and so on. Despite such efforts, there is currently no successful broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures to combat SARS-CoV-2 or possibly potential CoVs pandemic. Therefore it is desperately important to recognize and test widely efficient, reliable anti-CoV therapies now and in the future. Remdesivir and Favipiravir were more promising despite having side effects; it had prominent efficacy and efficiency while still not yet approved as the official anti-viral drug for SARS CoV-2. In this review, we summarizes the current drug and vaccine discovery status against SARS-CoV-2, predicting that these efforts will help create effective drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), first reported in China during December of 2019, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Infection later spread very rapidly around the globe with over 8,708,008 cases reported, including more than 461,715 deaths reported across at least 216 countries by June 20, 2020. It was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. With the rapidly increasing number of positive cases and deaths, there is a dire need for effective treatment. An urgent unmet need led to the planning and opening of multiple drug development trials for treatment and vaccine development. In this article, we have compiled comprehensive data on many candidate drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, umifenovir, arbidol, lopinavir, ritonavir, baricitinib, hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, azithromycin, baloxavir, oseltamivir, losartan, and tocilizumab. We have tabulated available data on various clinical trials testing various aspects of COVID-19 therapeutics.

TI  - A Double-Edged Sword-Cardiovascular Concerns of Potential Anti-COVID-19 Drugs
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS AND THERAPY
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 significantly affects multiple systems including the cardiovascular system. Most importantly, in addition to the direct injury from the virus per se, the subsequent cytokine storm, an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds, causes devastating damage. To date, emerging anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments are warranted to control epidemics. Several candidate drugs have been screened and are currently under investigation. These primarily include antiviral regimens and immunomodulatory regimens. However, beyond the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, these drugs may also have risks to the cardiovascular system, especially altering cardiac conduction. Herein, we review the cardiovascular risks of potential anti-COVID-19 drugs.

TI  - Advances in SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In December 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2q infection broke out in Wuhan, China. However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of this emerging virus. In this manuscript, we collected relevant articles and reviewed the characteristics about SARS-CoV-2.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an online search on PubMed and Web of Science with the keywords COVID-19, 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV-2, and summarized the epidemiology, virology, clinical features and treatments of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
   RESULTS: We retrieved 157 published papers about SARS-CoV-2 from January, 2020 to April, 2020. We found that SARS-CoV-2 was a kind of virus with low mortality rate and high infectivity. This virus can enter human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in alveoli and activate immune response in human body. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be classified as asymptomatic, mild, common, severe, and critical. We summarized antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir. Because the vaccine of SARS-CoV-2 is developing, more clinical studies are needed to verify the safety and efficacy of these treatments.
   CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has caused a global pandemic. We should pay more attention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 and try to control it sooner.

TI  - The impact of high-resolution structural data on stemming the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN VIROLOGY
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a catastrophic impact on human health and the world economy. The response of the scientific community was unparalleled, and a combined global effort has resulted in the creation of vaccines in a shorter time frame than previously unimaginable. Reflecting this concerted effort, the structural analysis of the etiological agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has progressed with an unprecedented pace. Since the onset of the pandemic, over 1000 high-resolution structures of a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been solved and made publicly available. These structures have aided in the identification of numerous potential druggable targets and have contributed to the design of different vaccine candidates. This opinion article will discuss the impact of high-resolution structures in understanding SARS-CoV-2 biology and explore their role in the development of vaccines and antivirals.

TI  - Combination treatment of short-course systemic corticosteroid and favipiravir in a successfully treated case of critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia with COPD
T2  - RESPIRATORY MEDICINE CASE REPORTS
AB  - Use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is not well described. A 58-year-old man with fever and progressive dyspnea was admitted to the Showa University Hospital, and showed severe respiratory failure which needed mechanical ventilation. His chest computed tomography scanning showed emphysema and bilateral ground-glass opacity caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. He received 30 mg prednisolone for five days with antiviral drug of favipiravir, and was successfully extubated on day five. A SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test became negative on day 15. He was discharged on day 21. Serum IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 converted to positive on day 7 and they kept positive on day 54 for both IgM and IgG. Combination treatment of short-course systemic corticosteroid and favipiravir might improve the prognosis for critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia with COPD without negative influence on viral clearance or antibody production.

TI  - Favipiravir and the Need for Early Ambulatory Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19)
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - It is becoming increasingly clear that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), like most human viral infections, will require multiple drugs in combination to treat COVID-19 illness. In this issue of the Journal, Doi and colleagues describe successful treatment of patients with early COVID-19 with favipiravir, an oral polymerase inhibitor, to rapidly and substantially clear SARS-CoV-2 from nasal secretions irrespective if it was started relatively early or later within the first week of infection. These data support the concept that favipiravir could be paired with at least one more off-target antiviral agent (doxycycline, azithromycin, or ivermectin) followed by corticosteroids and antithrombotics to prevent COVID-19 hospitalization and death in those over age 50 and/or those with one or more comorbidities. Clinical trials and advanced practice should immediately pivot to combination/sequential drug therapy for ambulatory COVID-19 illness.

T2  - DRUG RESEARCH
AB  - A recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and then spread rapidly all over the world. However, there are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19, using the agents which approved or in development for other viral infections is one of the potentially quickest ways to find treatment for this new viral infection. Favipiravir is an effective agent that acts as a nucleotide analog that selectively inhibits the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase or causes lethal mutagenesis upon incorporation into the virus RNA. In view of recent studies and discussion on favipiravir, in this mini review we aimed to summarize the clinical trials studying the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Ivermectin: A Closer Look at a Potential Remedy
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Amid the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the search for effective treatment and vaccines has been exponentially on the rise. Finding effective treatment has been the core of attention of many scientific reports and antivirals are in the center of those treatments. Numerous antivirals are being studied for the management of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir was the first drug to gain emergency FDA approval to be used in COVID-19. Similarly, favipiravir, an anti-influenza drug, is being studied as a potential agent against COVID-19. Contrastingly, hydroxychloroquine has been a controversial drug in the management of COVID-19.
   Nevertheless, the National Institute of Health (NIH), along with the World Health Organization (WHO), have discontinued clinical trials for hydroxychloroquine as the drug showed little or no survival benefit. Ivermectin, an antihelminthic drug, has shown antiviral properties previously. Additionally, it was described to be effective in vivo against the SARS-CoV-2. However, its survival benefit in patients with COVID-19 has not been documented. We herein propose the theory of inhaled ivermectin which can attain the desired lung concentration that will render it effective against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Chinese Therapeutic Strategy for Fighting COVID-19 and Potential Small-Molecule Inhibitors against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 20 million people infected worldwide with an average mortality rate of 3.6%. This virus poses major challenges to public health, as it not only is highly contagious but also can be transmitted by asymptomatic infected individuals. COVID-19 is clinically difficult to manage due to a lack of specific antiviral drugs or vaccines. In this article, Chinese therapy strategies for treating COVID-19 patients, including current applications of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), are comprehensively reviewed. Furthermore, 72 small molecules from natural products and TCM with reported antiviral activity against human coronaviruses (CoVs) are identified from published literature, and their potential applications in combating SARS-CoV-2 are discussed. Among these, the clinical efficacies of some accessible drugs such as remdesivir (RDV) and favipiravir (FPV) for COVID-19 are emphatically summarized. We hope this review provides a foundation for managing the worsening pandemic and developing antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Rapid incorporation of Favipiravir by the fast and permissive viral RNA polymerase complex results in SARS-CoV-2 lethal mutagenesis
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - The ongoing Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emphasized the urgent need for antiviral therapeutics. The viral RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) is a promising target with polymerase inhibitors successfully used for the treatment of several viral diseases. We demonstrate here that Favipiravir predominantly exerts an antiviral effect through lethal mutagenesis. The SARS-CoV RdRp complex is at least 10-fold more active than any other viral RdRp known. It possesses both unusually high nucleotide incorporation rates and high-error rates allowing facile insertion of Favipiravir into viral RNA, provoking C-to-U and G-to-A transitions in the already low cytosine content SARS-CoV-2 genome. The coronavirus RdRp complex represents an Achilles heel for SARS-CoV, supporting nucleoside analogues as promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.

T2  - CHEMICAL PAPERS
AB  - Specific inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly-emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a very promising strategy for developing highly potent medicines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, almost all of the reported viral RdRp inhibitors (either repurposed drugs or new antiviral agents) lack selectivity against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Herein, I discovered a new favipiravir derivative, (E)-N-(4-cyanobenzylidene)-6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (cyanorona-20), as the first potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor with very high selectivity (209- and 45-fold more potent than favipiravir and remdesivir, respectively). Based on the significant reduction in the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication/copies, strong computational cyanorona-20 ligand-RdRp protein interactions, and anti-RdRp activity of the parent favipiravir drug, SARS-CoV-2 inhibition is thought to be mediated through the coronaviral-2 RdRp inhibition. This promising selective anti-COVID-19 compound is also, to the best of our knowledge, the first bioactive derivative of favipiravir, the known antiinfluenza and antiviral drug. This new nucleoside analog was designed, synthesized, characterized, computationally studied (through pharmacokinetic calculations along with computational molecular modeling and prediction), and biologically evaluated for its anti-COVID-19 activities (through a validated in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay). The results of the biological assay showed that cyanorona-20 surprisingly exhibited very significant anti-COVID-19 activity (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 = 0.45 mu M), and, in addition, it could be also a very promising lead compound for the design of new anti-COVID-19 agents. Cyanorona-20 is a new favipiravir derivative with promise for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented challenge for the researchers to offer safe, tolerable, and effective treatment strategies for its causative agent known as SARS-CoV-2. With the rapid evolution of the pandemic, even the off-label use of existing drugs has been restricted by limited availability. Several old antivirals, antimalarial, and biological drugs are being reconsidered as possible therapies. The effectiveness of the controversial treatment options for COVID-19 such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme inhibitors and selective angiotensin receptor blockers was also discussed. A systemic search in the PubMed, Science Direct, LitCovid, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov data bases was conducted using the keywords "coronavirus drug therapy," passive immunotherapy for COVID-19', "convalescent plasma therapy," (CPT) "drugs for COVID-19 treatment," "SARS-CoV-2," "COVID-19," "2019-nCoV," "coronavirus immunology," "microbiology," "virology," and individual drug names. Systematic reviews, case presentations and very recent clinical guidelines were included. This narrative review summarizes the available information on possible therapies for COVID-19, providing recent data to health professionals.

World Health Organization and several states have declared a pandemic situation and state of emergency, respectively. As there is no treatment for COVID-19, several research institutes and pharmaceutical companies are racing to find a cure. Advances in computational approaches have allowed the screening of massive antiviral compound libraries to identify those that may potentially work against SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral agents developed in the past to combat other viruses are being repurposed. At the same time, new vaccine candidates are being developed and tested in preclinical/clinical settings. This review provides a detailed overview of select repurposed drugs, their mechanism of action, associated toxicities, and major clinical trials involving these agents.

TI  - Detailed Molecular Interactions of Favipiravir with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Influenza Virus Polymerases In Silico
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Favipiravir was initially developed as an antiviral drug against influenza and is currently used in clinical trials against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19). This agent is presumably involved in RNA chain termination during influenza virus replication, although the molecular interactions underlying its potential impact on the coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) remain unclear. We performed in silico studies to elucidate detailed molecular interactions between favipiravir and the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). As a result, no interactions between favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5 '-triphosphate (F-RTP), the active form of favipiravir, and the active sites of RdRps (PB1 proteins) from influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus were found, yet the agent bound to the tunnel of the replication genome of PB1 protein leading to the inhibition of replicated RNA passage. In contrast, F-RTP bound to the active sites of coronavirus RdRp in the presence of the agent and RdRp. Further, the agent bound to the replicated RNA terminus in the presence of agent, magnesium ions, nucleotide triphosphate, and RdRp proteins. These results suggest that favipiravir exhibits distinct mechanisms of action against influenza virus and various coronaviruses.

T2  - DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - A highly contagious coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused by a recently identified severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) initially detected in Wuhan, China has spread worldwide and become a major health crisis in the absence of specific vaccine or antiviral drugs. SARS-CoV-2 infection has resulted in overwhelming number of reported deaths. Unfortunately it is still spreading uncontrollably despite implementing stringent protective measures. Rapid development of effective therapeutic strategies for treatment and prevention of infection is crucially required. Although genomic characterization has assisted in unfolding various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 but development of specific antiviral drugs and vaccine against COVID-19 is still a worldwide challenge. Understanding the disease pathological course underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is imperative to identify the vital targets for drug development. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the host cell and primarily target type II alveolar cells. COVID-19 disease progression is associated with distressed immune functions and hyper active inflammatory system leading to development of cytokine storm which is a vital factor involved in disease advancement. The current review elucidates the disease pathology and summarizes the possible therapeutic options to battle against COVID-19 on the basis of current state of understanding about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic pathways and knowledge gained from previous SARS and MERS-CoV epidemics. Therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent infection as well as to suppress the disease progression to reduce severity and mortality rate is discussed. Drug candidates currently under consideration and undergoing clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment are highlighted.

TI  - Small-molecule metabolites in SARS-CoV-2 treatment: a comprehensive review
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has quickly spread all over the world. In this respect, traditional medicinal chemistry, repurposing, and computational approaches have been exploited to develop novel medicines for treating this condition. The effectiveness of chemicals and testing methods in the identification of new promising therapies, and the extent of preparedness for future pandemics, have been further highly advantaged by recent breakthroughs in introducing noble small compounds for clinical testing purposes. Currently, numerous studies are developing small-molecule (SM) therapeutic products for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, as well as managing the disease-related outcomes. Transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2)-inhibiting medicinal products can thus prevent the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into the cells, and constrain its spreading along with the morbidity and mortality due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly when co-administered with inhibitors such as chloroquine (CQ) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). The present review demonstrates that the clinical-stage therapeutic agents, targeting additional viral proteins, might improve the effectiveness of COVID-19 treatment if applied as an adjuvant therapy side-by-side with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors.

TI  - The Situation of Small Molecules Targeting Key Proteins in combatting SARS-CoV-2: Synthesis, Metabolic Pathway, Mechanism of Action, and Potential Therapeutic Applications
T2  - MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Due to the high mortality rate of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an immediate need to discover drugs that can help before a vaccine becomes available. Given that the process of producing new drugs is so long, the strategy of repurposing existing drugs is one of the promising options for the urgent treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Although FDA has approved Remdesivir for the use in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients suffering from COVID-19, no fully effective and reliable drug has been yet identified worldwide to treat COVID-19 specifically. Thus, scientists are still trying to find antivirals specific to COVID-19. This work reviews the chemical structure, metabolic pathway, and mechanism of action of the existing drugs with potential therapeutic applications for COVID-19. Furthermore, we summarized the molecular docking stimulation of the medications related to key protein targets. These already established drugs could be further developed, and after their testing through clinical trials, they could be used as suitable therapeutic options for patients suffering from COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel highly contagious and pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in late 2019. SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily through virus-containing droplets and small particles of air pollution, which greatly increases the risk of inhaling these virus particles when people are in close proximity. COVID-19 is spreading across the world, and the COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat to human health and public safety. To date, there are no specific vaccines or effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we focus on the enzyme targets of the virus and host that may be critical for the discovery of chemical compounds and natural products as antiviral drugs, and describe the development of potential antiviral drugs in the preclinical and clinical stages. At the same time, we summarize novel emerging technologies applied to the research on new drug development and the pathological mechanisms of COVID-19.

TI  - Do SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19) and the Medications Administered for Its Treatment Impair Testicular Functions?
T2  - UROLOGIA INTERNATIONALIS
AB  - Purpose: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted primarily via respiratory droplets and enters host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors. ACE-2 receptors have been identified in many tissues including testes. The aim of the study has been to investigate the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and its relative treatment on male reproductive health. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis has been performed on 49 recovered COVID-19 patients who had semen analysis prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who had a recovery time lag of at least 3 months have been re-examined, and 29 eligible patients with no andrological problems have been enrolled in the study. Following a detailed physical examination and retrieval of medical history, the values of semen analysis and serum sex hormone parameters have been collected and compared before and after COVID-19 infection. The p value of Results: The average age of the 29 patients has been 31.21 +/- 5.48 (range: 18-41) years. Favipiravir has been co-administered with hydroxychloroquine in 17 patients, while the remaining 12 received favipiravir treatment without hydroxychloroquine. The average time between clinical recovery from COVID-19 and collection of semen has been 4.52 +/- 1.36 (range: 3-8) months. Before and after COVID-19, serum follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, total testosterone, and prolactin levels, as well as all semen parameters, have been comparable. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that COVID-19 and its treatment with favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine did not affect spermatogenesis and serum androgen levels in the long-term period. Further clinical studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm and support our findings.

TI  - A review on favipiravir: the properties, function, and usefulness to treat COVID-19
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTI-INFECTIVE THERAPY
AB  - Introduction
   At this time, there is no specific therapeutic or vaccine for treatment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Hence, available drugs for treatment of other viral infections may be useful to treat COVID-19.
   Areas covered
   The focus of the current review was studying the main characteristics of favipiravir and its usefulness to treat COVID-19. An electronic search was done by using Pubmed and Google scholar.
   Expert opinion
   Based on the mechanism of action and safety of favipiravir, the drug may be a promising candidate for compassionate use against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Favipiravir has a wide range of activity against many single-stranded RNA viruses, is well tolerated in humans and has a high barrier to resistance. However, high doses of the agent are necessary to obtain an efficient antiviral activity. Favipiravir is teratogen in pregnant women and associated with the hyperuricemia. Therefore, the administration of the drug should be well controlled. Investigating the antiviral prophylactic potency of favipiravir and search for its pro-drugs and/or analogs showing improved activity and/or safety are critical.

TI  - Old Drugs for a New Virus: Repurposed Approaches for Combating COVID-19
T2  - ACS INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - There is a large global unmet need for effective countermeasures to combat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The development of novel antiviral drugs is expensive and too slow to meet the immediate need. The repurposing of drugs that are approved or are under advanced clinical investigation provides a cost- and time-effective therapeutic solution. This review summarizes the major repurposed approaches that have been proposed or are already being studied in clinical trials for COVID-19. Among these approaches are drugs that aim to reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication by targeting either viral enzymatic functions or cellular factors required for the viral life cycle. Drugs that modulate the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by boosting it to enhance viral clearance or by suppressing it to prevent excessive inflammation and tissue injury represent another category. Lastly, we discuss means to discover repurposed drugs and the ongoing challenges associated with the off-label use of existing drugs in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread throughout China as well as other countries. More than 8,700,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been recorded worldwide so far, with much more cases popping up overseas than those inside. As the initial epicenter in the world, China has been combating the epidemic for a relatively longer period and accumulated valuable experience in prevention and control of COVID-19. This article reviewed the clinical use, mechanism and efficacy of the clinically approved drugs recommended in the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (DTPNCP) released by National Health Commission of P.R. China, and the novel therapeutic agents now undergoing clinical trials approved by China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) to evaluate experimental treatment for COVID-19. Reviewing the progress in drug development for the treatment against COVID-19 in China may provide insight into the epidemic control in other countries.

AB  - Co-infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and tuberculosis (TB) is infrequent. Here, we report two patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia together with pulmonary TB. Patient 1 is a 70-year-old male with COVID-19 pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complication and pulmonary TB who received darunavir plus ritonavir, chloroquine and favipiravir for COVID-19 ARDS, and standard anti-TB agents were adjusted to non-rifampicin (levofloxacin) regimen to avoid drug-drug interaction between protease inhibitors and rifampicin. Patient 2 is a 56-year-old male with COVID-19 pneumonia and miliary TB who received hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and favipiravir for COVID-19 pneumonia, and a standard short course of rifampicin-based regimen for miliary TB. Given the prevalence of TB in Thailand, determination of TB co-infection among COVID-19 patients should lead to favorable clinical outcomes.

TI  - Pentoxifylline: A Drug with Antiviral and Anti-Inflammatory Effects to Be Considered in the Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019
T2  - MEDICAL PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE
AB  - In December 2019, a new coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from China, causing pneumonia outbreaks first in the Wuhan region and has now spread worldwide. There are no specific drugs for the disease caused by this virus, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Considering that new synthesized drugs cannot be applied immediately to patients, conventional drug in new use is a feasible solution. Chloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ribavirin, and ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Pentoxifylline, a drug with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and bronchodilatory effects, has previously been shown to inhibit several viral infections. Immunological studies have shown that most patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit substantially elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pentoxifylline is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which in turn activates protein kinase, leading to a reduction in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell migration. Here, we propose pentoxifylline, a drug with low cost and toxicity, as a possible treatment for COVID-19 based on its interesting properties.

T2  - CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus responsible for the current global pandemic, which first emerged in December 2019. This coronavirus has affected 217 countries worldwide, most of which have enacted non-remedial preventive measures, such as nationwide lockdowns, work from home, travel bans, and social isolation. Pharmacists, doctors, nurses, technologists, and other healthcare professionals have played pivotal roles during this pandemic. Unfortunately, confirmed drugs have not been identified for the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV2; however, favipiravir and remdesivir have been reported as promising antiviral drugs. Some vaccines have already been developed, and vaccination is ongoing globally. Various nanotechnologies are currently being developed in many countries for preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread and treating COVID-19 infections. In this article, we present an overview of the COVID-19 pandemic situation and discuss nanotechnology-based approaches and investigational therapeutics for COVID-19.

TI  - Retrospective evaluation of an observational cohort by the Central and Eastern Europe Network Group shows a high frequency of potential drug-drug interactions among HIV-positive patients receiving treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
T2  - HIV MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives The aim of this international multicentre study was to review potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) for real-life coadministration of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-specific medications. Methods The Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe Network Group initiated a retrospective, observational cohort study of HIV-positive patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected through a standardized questionnaire and DDIs were identified using the University of Liverpool's interaction checker. Results In total, 524 (94.1% of 557) patients received cART at COVID-19 onset: 117 (22.3%) were female, and the median age was 42 (interquartile range 36-50) years. Only 115 (21.9%) patients were hospitalized, of whom 34 required oxygen therapy. The most frequent nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone was tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) with lamivudine or emtricitabine (XTC) (79.3%) along with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) (68.5%), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (17.7%), protease inhibitor (PI) (13.7%) or other (2.5%). In total, 148 (28.2%) patients received COVID-19-specific treatments: corticosteroids (15.7%), favipiravir (7.1%), remdesivir (3.1%), hydroxychloroquine (2.7%), tocilizumab (0.6%) and anakinra (0.2%). In total, 62 DDI episodes were identified in 58 patients (11.8% of the total cohort and 41.9% of the COVID-19-specific treatment group). The use of boosted PIs and elvitegravir accounted for 43 DDIs (29%), whereas NNRTIs were responsible for 14 DDIs (9.5%). Conclusions In this analysis from the Central and Eastern European region on HIV-positive persons receiving COVID-19-specific treatment, it was found that potential DDIs were common. Although low-dose steroids are mainly used for COVID-19 treatment, comedication with boosted antiretrovirals seems to have the most frequent potential for DDIs. In addition, attention should be paid to NNRTI coadministration.

TI  - Therapeutic Effectiveness of Interferon Alpha 2b Treatment for COVID-19 Patient Recovery
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERFERON AND CYTOKINE RESEARCH
AB  - A previous report on 814 patients who were coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive provided preliminary therapeutic efficacy evidence with interferon-alpha 2b (IFN-alpha 2b) in Cuba, from March 11 to April 14, 2020. This study re-evaluates the effectiveness of IFN-alpha 2b during the period from March 11 to June 17, 2020. Patients received a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of IFN-alpha 2b. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from the hospital; the secondary endpoint was the case fatality rate, and several outcomes related to time variables were also evaluated. From March 11 to June 17, 2,295 patients had been confirmed to be severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive in Cuba, 2,165 were treated with Heberon(R) Alpha R, and 130 received the approved protocol without IFN. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with the non-IFN-treated group. Prior IFN treatment decreases the likelihood of intensive care and increases the survival after severe or critical diseases. Benefits of IFN were significantly supported by time variables analyzed. This second report confirmed our preliminary evidence about the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN-alpha 2b in SARS-CoV-2 infection and postulated Heberon Alpha R as the main component within antiviral drugs used in the Cuban protocol COVID-19.

TI  - Antiviral treatment in COVID-19: which is the most promising? - a narrative review
T2  - ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - The whole world is battling through coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is a fatal pandemic. In the early 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a global health emergency without definitive treatments and preventive approaches. In the absence of definitive therapeutic agents, this thorough review summarizes and outlines the potency and safety of all molecules and therapeutics which may have potential antiviral effects. A number of molecules and therapeutics licensed or being tested for some other conditions were found effective in different in vitro studies as well as in many small sample-sized clinical trials and independent case studies. However, in those clinical trials, there were some limitations which need to be overcome to find the most promising antiviral against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In conclusion, many of above-mentioned antivirals seems to have some therapeutic effects but none of them have been shown to have a strong evidence for their proper recommendation and approval in the treatment of COVID-19. Constantly evolving new evidences, exclusive adult data, language barrier, and type of study (observational, retrospective, small-sized clinical trials, or independent case series) resulted to the several limitations of this review. The need for multicentered, large sample-sized, randomized, placebo-controlled trials on COVID-19 patients to reach a proper conclusion on the most promising antiviral agent is warranted.

TI  - Computational insights of phytochemical-driven disruption of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-mediated replication of coronavirus: a strategic treatment plan against coronavirus disease 2019
T2  - NEW MICROBES AND NEW INFECTIONS
AB  - The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised global health concerns. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the prime component of viral replication/proliferation machinery and is considered to be a potential drug target against SARS-CoV-2. The present study investigated the anti-RdRp activity of phytochemicals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Virtual ligand screening was carried out to determine the potent compounds against RdRp. Molecular docking and an MD Simulation study were employed to evaluate the spatial affinity of selected phytochemicals for the active sites of RdRp. Structural stability of target compounds was determined using root mean square deviation computational analysis and drug-like abilities were investigated using ADMET. Bond distances between ligand and receptor were marked to predict the strength of interaction. Aloe, azadirachtin, columbin, cirsilineol, nimbiol, nimbocinol and sage exhibited the highest binding affinities and interacted with active sites of RdRp, surpassing the ability of chloroquine, lamivudine, favipiravir and remdesivir to target the same. All the natural metabolites exhibited stable conformation during MD Simulation of 101 ns at 310 K. Kinetic, potential and electrostatic energy were observed to be least in the case of natural metabolites in comparison with synthetic analogues. Deviations and fluctuations were observed to be structurally least in target phytochemicals. Physiochemical and biological properties of these compounds further validated their drug-like properties. Non-bonded distance was found to be short enough to form hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions, which revealed that these target compounds can strongly bind with RdRp. The study found potential phytochemicals to disrupt the replication domain of SARS-CoV-2 by hindering RdRp. We therefore anticipate that the current findings could be considered as valuable for the development of an efficient preventive/therapeutic expedient against COVID-19.

An extremely high potential for dissemination resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Remdesivir is considered the most promising antiviral agent; it works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily) is on-going. The other excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being clinically evaluated for its efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) alone is not shown to provide better antiviral efficacy than standard care. However, the regimen of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in vitro. Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2e5), which showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and antiSARS-CoV-2 potency in vitro. The roles of teicoplanin (which inhibits the viral genome exposure in cytoplasm) and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation. Avoiding the prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers is advised for COVID-19 patients.

TI  - A review of medications used to control and improve the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - In December 2019, an unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China. The virus that caused the disease was officially named by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). According to the high transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2, it became a global pandemic and public health emergency within few months. Since SARS-CoV-2 is genetically 80% homologous with the SARS-CoVs family, it is hypothesized that medications developed for the treatment of SARS-CoVs may be useful in the control and management of SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, some medication being tested in clinical trials and in vitro studies include anti-viral RNA polymerase inhibitors, HIV-protease inhibitors, anti-inflammatory agents, angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE 2) blockers, and some other novel medications. In this communication, we reviewed the general characteristics of medications, medical usage, mechanism of action, as well as SARS-CoV-2 related trials.

TI  - The Significance of Natural Product Derivatives and Traditional Medicine for COVID-19
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To date, there have been more than 10 million reported cases, more than 517,000 deaths in 215 countries, areas or territories. There is no effective antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19. Natural products and traditional medicine products with known safety profiles are a promising source for the discovery of new drug leads. There is increasing number of publications reporting the effect of natural products and traditional medicine products on COVID-19. In our review, we provide an overview of natural products and their derivatives or mimics, as well as traditional medicine products, which were reported to exhibit potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, and to manage COVID-19 in vivo, or in clinical reports or trials. These natural products and traditional medicine products are categorized in several classes: (1) anti-malaria drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, (2) antivirals including nucleoside analogs (remdesivir, favipiravir, beta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine, ribavirin and among others), lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol, (3) antibiotics including azithromycin, ivermectin and teicoplanin, (4) anti-protozoal drug, emetine, anti-cancer drug, homoharringtonine, and others, as well as (5) traditional medicine (Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule, Shuang Huang Lian Oral Liquid, Qingfei Paidu Decoction and Scutellariae Radix). Randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled large clinical trials are needed to provide solid evidence for the potential effective treatment. Currently, drug repurposing is a promising strategy to quickly find an effective treatment for COVID-19. In addition, carefully combined cocktails need to be examined for preventing a COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting global health concerns.

TI  - Impact of repurposed drugs on the symptomatic COVID-19 patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus capable of causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared as a global public health emergency on January 30, 2020, by the World Health Organization. In this devastating situation, precautionary mea sures, early diagnosis, and repurposed drugs appear to be timely and decisive factors by which to handle this problem until the discovery of an effective, dedicated vaccine or medicine is made. Currently, some researchers and clinicians have claimed evidence exists in favor of the use of some antimalarial drugs (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) antiviral drugs (remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, umifenovir) vitamins, traditional Chinese medicines, and herbal medicines against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the available literature, this review article sought to highlight the current understanding of the origin, transmission, diagnosis, precautionary measures, infection and drug action mechanisms, therapeutic role, and toxicities of targeted drugs for the prevention and cure of COVID-19. This review may be useful for developing further strategies as a blueprint and understanding the mentioned drugs' mechanisms to elucidate the possible target of action by which to successfully freeze the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

TI  - Pharmacologic Treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) A Review
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Importance The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment. Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Observations No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective to date.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2: From the pathogenesis to potential anti-viral treatments
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Introduction: The world is witnessing the spread of one of the members of Coronaviruses (CoVs) family, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the 21st century. Considering the short time spent after its prevalence, limited information is known about the effect of the virus mechanism on different organs of the body; meanwhile the lack of specific treatment and vaccine for this virus has exposed millions of people to a big challenge.
   Areas covered: The review article aims to describe the general and particular characteristics of CoVs, their classification, genome structure, host cell infection, cytokine storm, anti-viral treatments, and inhibition of COVID-19-related ER-mitochondrial stress. In addition, it refers to drugs such as Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, darunavir, ribavirin, remdesivir, and favipiravir, which have undergone clinical trials for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. This analysis was derived from an extensive scientific literature search including Pubmed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar performed.
   Expert opinion: The effectiveness rate and complications of these drugs can reveal new insights into the potential therapeutic goals for the disease. Moreover, lifestyle change can effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 in Turkish Patients with Hematological Malignancies
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Patients with solid malignancies are more vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection than the healthy population. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in highly immunosuppressed populations, such as in patients with hematological malignancies, is a point of interest. We aimed to analyze the symptoms, complications, intensive care unit admissions, and mortality rates of patients with hematological malignancies infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Turkey. Materials and Methods: In this multicenter study, we included 340 adult and pediatric patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 from March to November 2020. Diagnosis and status of primary disease, treatment schedules for hematological malignancies, time from last treatment, life expectancy related to the hematological disease, and comorbidities were recorded, together with data regarding symptoms, treatment, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Forty four patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis of SARSCoV-2 infection. Among symptomatic patients, fever, cough, and dyspnea were observed in 62.6%, 48.8%, and 41.8%, respectively. Sixtynine (20%) patients had mild SARS-CoV-2 disease, whereas moderate, severe, and critical disease was reported in 101 (29%), 71 (20%), and 55 (16%) patients, respectively. Of the entire cohort, 251 (73.8%) patients were hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2. Mortality related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 26.5% in the entire cohort; this comprised 4.4% of those patients with mild disease, 12.4% of those with moderate disease, and 83% of those with severe or critical disease. Active hematological disease, lower life expectancy related to primary hematological disease, neutropenia at diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, ICU admission, and first-line therapy used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment were found to be related to higher mortality rates. Treatments with hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin were associated with a higher rate of mortality in comparison to favipiravir use. Conclusion: Patients with hematological malignancy infected with SARS-CoV-2 have an increased risk of severe disease and mortality.

TI  - Acute eosinophilic pneumonia accompanied with COVID-19: a case report
T2  - RESPIROLOGY CASE REPORTS
AB  - We report a case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) triggered by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. A 77-year-old man experienced left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) revealed a positive result, and he was treated with favipiravir, ciclesonide, and lascufloxacin, but he showed poor improvement. On the other hand, computed tomography (CT) images were atypical for COVID-19 infection, and the elevation of eosinophil was found in blood and the fluid obtained by bronchoscopy. So, we clinically diagnosed this case as AEP. Administration of prednisolone dramatically improved the patient's clinical condition and chest radiograph findings, which were consistent with the clinical course of AEP. This case suggests the importance of considering the complications of AEP when treating patients with COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Interface-based design of the favipiravir-binding site in SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase reveals mutations conferring resistance to chain termination
T2  - FEBS LETTERS
AB  - Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) currently being used to manage COVID-19. Accumulation of mutations in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RdRp may facilitate antigenic drift, generating favipiravir resistance. Focussing on the chain-termination mechanism utilized by favipiravir, we used high-throughput interface-based protein design to generate > 100 000 designs of the favipiravir-binding site of RdRp and identify mutational hotspots. We identified several single-point mutants and designs having a sequence identity of 97%-98% with wild-type RdRp, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can develop favipiravir resistance with few mutations. Out of 134 mutations documented in the CoV-GLUE database, 63 specific mutations were already predicted as resistant in our calculations, thus attaining similar to 47% correlation with the sequencing data. These findings improve our understanding of the potential signatures of adaptation in SARS-CoV-2 against favipiravir.

TI  - Progress, pitfalls, and path forward of drug repurposing for COVID-19 treatment
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN RESPIRATORY DISEASE
AB  - On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic a public health emergency of international concern. The viral outbreak led in turn to an exponential growth of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, that is, a multiorgan disease that has led to more than 6.3 million deaths worldwide, as of June 2022. There are currently few effective drugs approved for treatment of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 patients. Many of the compounds tested so far have been selected through a drug repurposing approach, that is, by identifying novel indications for drugs already approved for other conditions. We here present an up-to-date review of the main Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 infection, discussing their mechanism of action and their most important preclinical and clinical results. Reviewed compounds were chosen to privilege those that have been approved for use in SARS-CoV-2 patients or that have completed phase III clinical trials. Moreover, we also summarize the evidence on some novel and promising repurposed drugs in the pipeline. Finally, we discuss the current stage and possible steps toward the development of broadly effective drug combinations to suppress the onset or progression of COVID-19.

TI  - Therapeutic and Vaccine Options for COVID-19: Status after Six Months of the Disease Outbreak
T2  - SLAS DISCOVERY
AB  - An outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by an infection of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This new virus belongs to the group of enveloped RNA beta-coronaviruses. Symptoms may differ in various infected persons, but major presentations include dry cough, nasal congestion, shortness of breath, fever, and general malaise. The disease appears to be more severe in patients above the age of 60 years and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. There is still no approved vaccine against COVID-19, but more than a hundred are at different stages of development. It is known that the development of new drugs takes a relatively long time, so several known and already-approved drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of this disease. In this review, we explore the therapeutic and vaccine options that are available for COVID-19 6 months after its outbreak. Most noteworthy among the therapeutic options are dexamethasone, remdesivir, Avigan (favipiravir) and convalescent plasma.

TI  - Potential therapeutic agents to COVID-19: An update review on antiviral therapy, immunotherapy, and cell therapy
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2020 and coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) was later announced as pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Since then, several studies have been conducted on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by potential vaccines and drugs. Although, the governments and global population have been attracted by some vaccine production projects, the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antiviral drugs would be an urge necessity in parallel with the efficient preventive vaccines. Various nonspecific drugs produced previously against other bacterial, viral, and parasite infections were recently evaluated for treating patients with COVID-19. In addition to therapeutic properties of these anti-COVID-19 compounds, some adverse effects were observed in different human organs as well. Not only several attentions were paid to antiviral therapy and treatment of COVID-19, but also nanomedicine, immunotherapy, and cell therapy were conducted against this viral infection. In this review study, we planned to introduce the present and potential future treatment strategies against COVID-19 and define the advantages and disadvantages of each treatment strategy.

TI  - A case of COVID-19 reinfection in a hemodialysis patient: the role of antibody in SARS-CoV-2 infection
T2  - CEN CASE REPORTS
AB  - Hemodialysis patients are vulnerable to severe and lethal COVID-19, and their protective immunity against COVID-19 is not yet fully understood. Therefore, we report a case of COVID-19 reinfection in a hemodialysis patient 81 days after the first episode and discuss the role of antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 infection. A hemodialysis patient developed asymptomatic COVID-19 due to an outbreak in a hospital on October 29th, 2020. As he was hospitalized and did not develop any symptoms, he was discharged on November 9th. On January 18th, he presented with symptomatic COVID-19 due to close household contact. Then, he developed respiratory failure and was transferred to National Center for Global Health and Medicine if he would need intensive care. He recovered with oxygen inhalation, favipiravir, and steroid treatment, and was discharged on February 12th. To evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during two hospital stays, we measured immunoglobulin (Ig) G specific for S1 subunit of Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 (IgG-S1) , IgG specific for the full-length S protein (anti-Spike IgG) and neutralizing antibodies. No seroconversion occurred 5 days after initial infection, the seroconversion of IgG-S1 was observed 10 days after the second infection. Similar to IgG-S1 antibody titer results, anti-Spike IgG and neutralizing antibodies increased from 12 days after the second infection. In conclusion, we experienced a case of COVID-19 reinfection in a hemodialysis patient 81 days after the first episode and showed the kinetics and role of antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to understand SARS-CoV-2 reinfection risk in hemodialysis patients and its clinical significance.

TI  - Unraveling the mechanism of arbidol binding and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2: Insights from atomistic simulations
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly and poses an unprecedented threat to the global economy and human health. Broad-spectrum antivirals are currently being administered to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China's prevention and treatment guidelines suggest the use of an anti-influenza drug, arbidol, for the clinical treatment of COVID-19. Reports indicate that arbidol could neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Monotherapy with arbidol is superior to lopinavir-ritonavir or favipiravir for treating COVID-19. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, arbidol acts by interfering with viral binding to host cells. However, the detailed mechanism by which arbidol induces the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Here, we present atomistic insights into the mechanism underlying membrane fusion inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by arbidol. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation-based analyses demonstrate that arbidol binds and stabilizes at the receptor-binding domain (RBD)/ACE2 interface with a high affinity. It forms stronger intermolecular interactions with the RBD than ACE2. Analyses of the detailed decomposition of energy components and binding affinities revealed a substantial increase in the affinity between the RBD and ACE2 in the arbidol-bound RBD/ACE2 complex, suggesting that arbidol generates favorable interactions between them. Based on our MD simulation results, we propose that the binding of arbidol induces structural rigidity in the viral glycoprotein, thus restricting the conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion and virus entry. Furthermore, key residues of the RBD and ACE2 that interact with arbidol were identified, opening the door for developing therapeutic strategies and higher-efficacy arbidol derivatives or lead drug candidates.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak poses a major global threat to the public health worldwide. The infectious disease caused by the virus that affected the entire world was named as the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The knowledge regarding the wide clinico-biological aspects of the COVID-19 continues to evolve very rapidly, given the growing data from all over the world. During this complicated process, healthcare professionals have benefited from each other's experiences in combatting against the COVID-19 syndrome. COVID-19 related studies have been performed by a wide variety of research groups in Turkey as well as the rest of the world. The aim of this paper is to outline Turkish COVID-19 research indexed in the LitCovid system. LitCovid is a curated literature hub for tracking up-to-date scientific data about the SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19's first case was detected in Turkey, on March 11th, 2020. Six months after the first case was observed, the total number of COVID-19 patients was reported to be as 286,455, and the total number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 was 6895. The genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus showed significant identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Numerous drugs including lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, neuraminidase inhibitors, remdesivir, umifenovir, azithromycin, and chloroquine have been suggested for the management of COVID-19 although the exact treatment is yet to be determined.

TI  - Drug Repurposing for COVID-19: A Review and a Novel Strategy to Identify New Targets and Potential Drug Candidates
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - In December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in the province of Wuhan, China. Since then, there have been over 400 million confirmed cases and 5.8 million deaths by COVID-19 reported worldwide. The urgent need for therapies against SARS-CoV-2 led researchers to use drug repurposing approaches. This strategy allows the reduction in risks, time, and costs associated with drug development. In many cases, a repurposed drug can enter directly to preclinical testing and clinical trials, thus accelerating the whole drug discovery process. In this work, we will give a general overview of the main developments in COVID-19 treatment, focusing on the contribution of the drug repurposing paradigm to find effective drugs against this disease. Finally, we will present our findings using a new drug repurposing strategy that identified 11 compounds that may be potentially effective against COVID-19. To our knowledge, seven of these drugs have never been tested against SARS-CoV-2 and are potential candidates for in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate their effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - A Favipiravir-induced Fever in a Patient with COVID-19
T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - We herein report the first case of a fever induced by favipiravir, a potential coronavirus disease 2019 therapeutic drug. An 82-year-old man diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia was transferred to our hospital following a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction test. He was treated with compassionate use of favipiravir. Both his oxygen demand and fever gradually improved after admission; however, his fever relapsed, and the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels increased on day 7. We diagnosed his fever as being favipiravir-induced. The fever resolved a few days after favipiravir discontinuation, demonstrating the accuracy of the diagnosis. This case revealed that favipiravir can induce a fever.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of Favipiravir in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19
T2  - CTS-CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE
AB  - Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) infection has been rapidly spreading worldwide and causing the respiratory illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The antiretroviral drug favipiravir (FPV) has been experimentally used for COVID-19 treatment since March 2020 in Japan. However, the pharmacokinetics of FPV in critically ill patients is unknown. We measured the serum concentration of FPV using high-performance liquid chromatography in patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patients were administered 1,600 mg of FPV twice daily on day 1, followed by 600 mg twice daily from day 2 to day 5 (or more if needed). Suspensions of FPV tablets were administered through a nasogastric tube. Seven patients were enrolled in this study. Forty-nine blood samples were obtained from the eligible patients to evaluate FPV concentration. The FPV trough (after 8-12 hours) concentrations of most samples were lower than the lower limit of quantification (1 mu g/mL) and half-maximal effective concentration (9.7 mu g/mL) against SARS-CoV-2 previously testedin vitro. FPV trough concentration in critically ill patients was much lower than that of healthy subjects in a previous clinical trial, which is a cause for great concern. Further study is required to determine the optimal strategy for treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.

TI  - Inflammation and thrombosis in patients with COVID-19: A prothrombotic and inflammatory disease caused by SARS coronavirus-2
T2  - ANATOLIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2" (SARS-CoV-2) infection emerged in Wuhan, a city of China, and spread to the entire planet in early 2020. The virus enters the respiratory tract cells and other tissues via ACE2 receptors. Approximately 20% of infected subjects develop severe or critical disease. A cytokine storm leads to over inflammation and thrombotic events. The most common clinical presentation in COVID-19 is pneumonia, typically characterized by bilateral, peripheral, and patchy infiltrations in the lungs. However multi-systemic involvement including peripheral thromboembolic skin lesions, central nervous, gastrointestinal, circulatory, and urinary systems are reported. The disease has a higher mortality compared to other viral agents causing pneumonia and unfortunately, no approved specific therapy, nor vaccine has yet been discovered. Several clinical trials are ongoing with hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, and low molecular weight heparins. This comprehensive review aimed to summarize coagulation abnormalities reported in COVID-19, discuss the thrombosis, and inflammation-driven background of the disease, emphasize the impact of thrombotic and inflammatory processes on the progression and prognosis of COVID-19, and to provide evidence-based therapeutic guidance, especially from antithrombotic and antiinflammatory perspectives.

TI  - Small-molecule Antiviral Agents in Ongoing Clinical Trials for COVID-19
T2  - CURRENT DRUG TARGETS
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in December 2019 and has rapidly spread globally. As the confirmed number of cases has reached 83 million worldwide, the potential severity and the deadly complications of the disease requires urgent development of effective drugs for prevention and treatment. No proven effective treatment for this virus currently exists. Most of the antiviral discovery efforts are focused on the repurposing of approved or clinical stage drugs. This review highlights the small-molecule repurposed antiviral agents that are currently under investigation in clinical trials for COVID-19. These include viral polymerase and protease inhibitors remdesivir, galidesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, sofosbuvir, tenofovir/emtricitabine, baloxavir marboxil, EIDD-2801, lopinavir/ritonavir; virus-/host-directed viral entry and fusion inhibitors arbidol chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, chlorpromazine, camostat mesylate, nafamostat mesylate, bromhexine and agents with diverse/unclear mechanism of actions as oseltamivir, triazavirin, ivermectin, nitazoxanide, niclosamide and BLD-2660. The published preclinical and clinical data to date on these drugs as well as the mechanisms of action are reviewed.

TI  - Pathophysiology and Potential Therapeutic Candidates for COVID-19: A Poorly Understood Arena
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an acute onset pneumonia caused by a novelBetacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in the Wuhan City of China in December 2019 and evolved into a global pandemic. To date, there are no proven drugs or vaccines against this virus. Hence, the situation demands an urgent need to explore all potential therapeutic strategies that can be made available to prevent the disease progression and improve patient outcomes. In absence of clinically proven treatment guidelines, several repurposed drugs and investigational agents are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for their probable benefits in the treatment of COVID-19. These include antivirals (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir, and favipiravir), interferon, antimalarials (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine), antiparasitic drugs (ivermectin and nitazoxanide), biologics (monoclonal antibodies and interleukin receptor antagonist), cellular therapies (mesenchymal stem cells and natural killer cells), convalescent plasma, and cytokine adsorber. Though several observational studies have claimed many of these agents to be effective based on theirin vitroactivities and extrapolated evidence from SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics, the currently available data remains inconclusive because of ill-defined patient selection criteria, small sample size, lack of concurrent controls, and use of intermediary outcomes instead of patient-relevant outcomes. Moreover, there is a need to clearly define the patient populations who warrant therapy and also the timing of initiation of treatment. Understanding the disease pathology responsible for the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is imperative to identify the potential targets for drug development. This review explains the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and summarizes the potential treatment candidates, which can provide guidance in developing effective therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Understanding the clinical utility of favipiravir (T-705) in coronavirus disease of 2019: a review
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has caused significant morbidity and mortality among infected individuals across the world. High transmissibility rate of the causative virus - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - has led to immense strain and bottlenecking of the health care system. While noteworthy advances in vaccine development have been made amid the current global pandemic, most therapeutic agents are repurposed from use in other viral infections and are being evaluated for efficacy in COVID-19. Favipiravir, an orally administered drug originally developed in Japan against emerging influenza viral strains, has been shown to have widespread application and safety across multiple ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral infections. With a strong affinity toward the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), favipiravir could be a promising therapy against SARS-CoV-2, by targeting downstream viral RNA replication. Initial trials for usage in COVID-19 have suggested that favipiravir administration during initial infection stages, in individuals with mild to moderate infection, has a strong potential to improve clinical outcomes. However, additional well-designed clinical trials are required to closely examine ideal timing of drug administration, dosage, and duration, to assess the role of favipiravir in COVID-19 therapy. This review provides evidence-based insights and throws light on the current clinical trials examining the efficacy of favipiravir in tackling COVID-19, including its mechanism, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics.

TI  - Placental transfer and safety in pregnancy of medications under investigation to treat coronavirus disease 2019
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY MFM
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 is mostly symptomatic, but a wide range of medications are under investigation against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials, they will inevitably receive therapies whenever they seem effective in nonpregnant patients and even under compassionate use.
   METHODS: We conducted a review of the literature on placental transfer and pregnancy safety data of drugs under current investigation for coronavirus disease 2019.
   RESULTS: Regarding remdesivir, there are no data in pregnant women. Several other candidates already have safety data in pregnant women, because they are repurposed drugs already used for their established indications. Thus, they may be used in pregnancy, although their safety in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 may differ from conventional use. These include HIV protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir that have low placental transfer, interferon that does not cross the placental barrier, and hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine that has high placental transfer. There are also pregnancy safety and placental transfer data for colchicine, steroids, oseltamivir, azithromycin, and some monoclonal antibodies. However, some drugs are strictly prohibited in pregnancy because of known teratogenicity (thalidomide) or fetal toxicities (reninangiotensin system blockers). Other candidates including tocilizumab, other interleukin 6 inhibitors, umifenovir, and favipiravir have insufficient data on pregnancy outcomes.
   CONCLUSION: In life-threatening cases of coronavirus disease 2019, the potential risks of therapy to the fetus may be more than offset by the benefit of curing the mother. Although preclinical and placental transfer studies are required for a number of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 drugs, several medications can already be used in pregnant women.

TI  - Efficacy of favipiravir for an end stage renal disease patient on maintenance hemodialysis infected with novel coronavirus disease 2019
T2  - CEN CASE REPORTS
AB  - Background Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) refers to infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen, and has spread to pandemic levels since its inception in December 2019. While several risk factors for severe presentation have been identified, the clinical course for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on maintenance hemodialysis with COVID-19 has been unclear. Previous studies have revealed that some antiviral agents may be effective against COVID-19 in the general population, but the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these agents in ESRD patients remain under investigation. Favipiravir, an antiviral agent developed for treatment of influenza, is one candidate treatment for COVID-19, but suitable dosages for patients with renal insufficiency are unknown. Here we provide a first report on the efficacy of favipiravir in a patient with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis. Case presentation The case involved a 52-year-old woman with COVID-19 who had been undergoing maintenance hemodialysis three times a week for 3 years due to diabetic nephropathy. She had initially been treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and ciclesonide for 5 days, but developed severe pneumonia requiring invasive positive-pressure ventilation. Those antiviral agents were subsequently switched to favipiravir. She recovered gradually, and after 2 weeks was extubated once the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 fell below the limit of detection. Although concentrations of several biliary enzymes were elevated, no major adverse events were observed. Conclusion Favipiravir may be an effective option for the treatment of COVID-19-infected patients with ESRD.

TI  - Remdesivir is a direct-acting antiviral that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with high potency
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Effective treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed to control this current pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Replication of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the likely target of the investigational nucleotide analogue remdesivir (RDV). RDV shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses, and previous studies with RdRps from Ebola virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have revealed that delayed chain termination is RDV's plausible mechanism of action. Here, we expressed and purified active SARS-CoV-2 RdRp composed of the nonstructural proteins nsp8 and nsp12. Enzyme kinetics indicated that this RdRp efficiently incorporates the active triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) into RNA. Incorporation of RDV-TP at position i caused termination of RNA synthesis at position i+3. We obtained almost identical results with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps. A unique property of RDV-TP is its high selectivity over incorporation of its natural nucleotide counterpart ATP. In this regard, the triphosphate forms of 2?-C-methylated compounds, including sofosbuvir, approved for the management of hepatitis C virus infection, and the broad-acting antivirals favipiravir and ribavirin, exhibited significant deficits. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the target specificity of RDV, as RDV-TP was less efficiently incorporated by the distantly related Lassa virus RdRp, and termination of RNA synthesis was not observed. These results collectively provide a unifying, refined mechanism of RDV-mediated RNA synthesis inhibition in coronaviruses and define this nucleotide analogue as a direct-acting antiviral.

T2  - ALL LIFE
AB  - Favipiravir and remdesivir, inhibitors of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) were recently suggested as a potential SARS-CoV2 inhibitors. Since favipiravir and remdesivir target a critical and a viral-specific process, discovering other small molecules that do the same to use as treatment could be beneficial in slowing the outbreak. Though there have been many suggested antivirals to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, most treatments target host-associated pathways that may cause adverse effects, Small molecules inhibitors of RdRp may be the best remedy against the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in the presence of favipiravir-RTP
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - The RNA polymerase inhibitor favipiravir is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), despite limited information about the molecular basis for its activity. Here we report the structure of favipiravir ribonucleoside triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP) in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) bound to a template:primer RNA duplex, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to a resolution of 2.5 A degrees. The structure shows clear evidence for the inhibitor at the catalytic site of the enzyme, and resolves the conformation of key side chains and ions surrounding the binding pocket. Polymerase activity assays indicate that the inhibitor is weakly incorporated into the RNA primer strand, and suppresses RNA replication in the presence of natural nucleotides. The structure reveals an unusual, nonproductive binding mode of favipiravir-RTP at the catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, which explains its low rate of incorporation into the RNA primer strand. Together, these findings inform current and future efforts to develop polymerase inhibitors for SARS coronaviruses.

TI  - In silico Studies Predict Efficient Binding of Remdesivir and Favipiravir with 3-chymotrypsin like protease of SARS-CoV-2 for COVID-19 Interventional Therapy
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Favipiravir and remdesivir are investigational drugs for coronavirus disease 2019 that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The active forms of these drugs are reported to target and inhibit viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase, which is derived from 3-chymotrypsin like protease, a viral replicase enzyme. The present in silico study explores the comparative efficacy of these drugs to inhibit 3-chymotrypsin like protease and RNA dependent RNA polymerase, to plan therapeutic options for patients based on their disease severity. Active favipiravir and remdesivir molecules bind to 3-chymotrypsin like protease with energies of 6.18 and -6.52 kcal/mol in contrast to -5.62 and -3.91 kcal/mol for RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Further, hydrophobic interactions and salt bridge formations cement drug bindings with 3-chymotrypsin like protease, but not with RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Molecular dynamic simulation experiments, performed under certain experimental constraints reveal that the root mean square flexibilities of active residues in drug complexes with 3-chymotrypsin like protease are lower than in free 3-chymotrypsin like protease making the former more stable than the latter because of their rigidity and stabilities. Both drugs may hence serve as good therapeutic options for early stages of coronavirus disease 2019. However, more severe symptoms may be treated better with favipiravir due to its better binding with RNA dependent RNA polymerase, as compared to remdesivir. The "one drug does not fit all" concept is true for coronavirus disease 2019 as it is being currently realized by clinicians all around the world. Hence precise knowledge about critical interactions of these drugs with the viral enzymes will help medicos make vital therapeutic decisions on interventional options for patients who report to hospitals without over symptoms or with varying degrees of disease severity.

TI  - Evaluation of minocycline combined with favipiravir therapy in coronavirus disease 2019 patients: A case-series study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of minocycline (MIN) and favipiravir combination therapy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to our hospital in Fukui Prefecture, Japan, in March and April of 2020. In this retrospective study, a favipiravir monotherapy group (Control group, n = 9) was compared with a combined favipiravir plus MIN therapy group (MIN group, n = 12). No severe cases were present. The primary comparative endpoints evaluated were duration of fever, duration of hospitalization, duration from treatment initiation to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative results, and changes in cytokine and chemokine production. Median duration from start of treatment to negative PCR test was significantly shorter in the MIN group than in the Control group. Mean rates of cytokine and chemokine reduction were significantly greater for interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in the MIN group. No difference in adverse event rates were seen between groups, and only minor adverse events were encountered. MIN has been reported to have not only broad antibacterial activity, but also antiviral and antiinflammatory activity. The present results support the efficacy and safety of MIN plus favipiravir therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - GRL-0920, an Indole Chloropyridinyl Ester, Completely Blocks SARS-CoV-2 Infection
T2  - MBIO
AB  - We assessed various newly generated compounds that target the main protease (M-Pro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and various previously known compounds reportedly active against SARS-CoV-2, employing RNA quantitative PCR (RNA-qPCR), cytopathicity assays, and immunocytochemistry. Here, we show that two indole-chloropyridinyl-ester derivatives, GRL-0820 and GRL-0920, exerted potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell-based assays performed using VeroE6 cells and TMPRSS2-overexpressing VeroE6 cells. While GRL0820 and the nucleotide analog remdesivir blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral breakthrough occurred. No significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity was found for several compounds reportedly active against SARS-CoV-2 such as lopinavir, nelfinavir, nitazoxanide, favipiravir, and hydroxychroloquine. In contrast, GRL-0920 exerted potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 (50% effective concentration [EC50] = 2.8 mu M) and dramatically reduced the infectivity, replication, and cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 without significant toxicity as examined with immunocytochemistry. Structural modeling shows that indole and chloropyridinyl of the derivatives interact with two catalytic dyad residues of M-pro, Cys145 and His41, resulting in covalent bonding, which was verified using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS), suggesting that the indole moiety is critical for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of the derivatives. GRL-0920 might serve as a potential therapeutic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and might be optimized to generate more-potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds.
   IMPORTANCE Targeting the main protease (M-pro) of SARS-CoV-2, we identified two indole-chloropyridinyl-ester derivatives, GRL-0820 and GRL-0920, active against SARSCoV-2, employing RNA-qPCR and immunocytochemistry and show that the two compounds exerted potent activity against SARS-CoV-2. While GRL-0820 and remdesivir blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral breakthrough occurred as examined with immunocytochemistry. In contrast, GRL-0920 completely blocked the infectivity and cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 without significant toxicity. Structural modeling showed that indole and chloropyridinyl of the derivatives interacted with two catalytic dyad residues of M-Pro, Cys145 and His41, resulting in covalent bonding, which was verified using HPLC/MS. The present data should shed light on the development of therapeutics for COVID-19, and optimization of GRL-0920 based on the present data is essential to develop more-potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds for treating COVID-19.

TI  - The History, Efficacy, and Safety of Potential Therapeutics: A Narrative Overview of the Complex Life of COVID-19
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic posed a serious public health concern and started a race against time for researchers to discover an effective and safe therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to describe the history, efficacy, and safety of five potential therapeutics for COVID-19, remdesivir, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma. A literature review was conducted through October 2020 to identify published studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of these five potential therapeutics. Clinical improvement was used to assess the efficacy, while reported withdrawals from study participation and adverse events were used to evaluate the safety. In total, 95 clinical studies (6 interventional and 89 observational studies) were obtained, of which 42 were included in this review. The evaluation of the efficacy and safety profiles is challenging due to the limitations of the clinical studies on one hand, and the limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the other. Moreover, there was insufficient evidence to support repurposing remdesivir, favipiravir, and tocilizumab for COVID-19.

TI  - Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine as Therapeutics for COVID-19: Truth under the Mystery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. One major challenge in the battle against this deadly disease is to find effective therapy. Due to the availability and proven clinical record of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) in various human diseases, there have been enormous efforts in repurposing these two drugs as therapeutics for COVID-19. To date, substantial amount of work at cellular, animal models and clinical trials have been performed to verify their therapeutic potential against COVID-19. However, neither lab-based studies nor clinical trials have provided consistent and convincing evidence to support the therapeutic value of HCQ/CQ in the treatment of COVID-19. In this mini review we provide a systematic summary on this important topic and aim to reveal some truth covered by the mystery regarding the therapeutic value of HCQ/CQ in COVID-19.

TI  - Prolonged persistence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during A plus AVD therapy for classical Hodgkin's lymphoma: A case report
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CANCER
AB  - We describe a case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a patient with mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) undergoing brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A+AVD) therapy. A 43-year-old man presented to our hospital with a complaint of fever, for which he was diagnosed with COVID-19 after a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and antiviral therapy with favipiravir and ciclesonide was started subsequently. The fever persisted for the first few days of treatment, but his respiratory status was stable, and he became asymptomatic and afebrile on day 9. Although the PCR tests remained positive, he met the updated discharge criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) on day 12. However, his fever recurred, and his condition worsened on day 16. A chest X-ray showed a new opacity. It is likely that favipiravir and ciclesonide treatment probably did not completely eliminate the virus in the patient, and therefore the infection persisted. We added remdesivir from day 21, and the improvement was remarkable. He was discharged on day 29 after two consecutive PCR test results were negative. PCR tests are not mandatory for the updated WHO discharge criteria. However, even after antiviral therapy, COVID-19 patients with hematologic malignancies may have prolonged active infection with impaired viral excretion. Depending on the background disease and comorbidities, there may be some patient populations for whom it is not appropriate to simply comply with the current discharge criteria. Therefore, more emphasis may be needed on PCR examinations. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tissue distributions of antiviral drugs affect their capabilities of reducing viral loads in COVID-19 treatment
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Repurposing of approved antiviral drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a promising strategy to treat Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Previously we reported our hypothesis that the antiviral drugs with high lung distributions might benefit COVID-19 patients by reducing viral loads. So far, chloroquine, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, favipiravir, ribavirin, darunavir, remdesivir, and umifenovir have been tested in COVID-19 clinical trials. Here we validated our hypothesis by comparing the pharmacokinetics profiles of these drugs and their capabilities of reducing viral load in clinical trials. According to bulk RNA and single cell RNA sequencing analysis, we found that high expression of both angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) makes the lung and intestine vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and favipiravir, which were highly distributed to the lung, were reported to reduce viral loads in respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients. Conversely, drugs with poor lung distributions, including lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir and remdesivir, were insufficient to inhibit viral replication. Lopinavir/ritonavir might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the GI tract according to their distribution profiles. We concluded here that the antiviral drugs should be distributed straight to the lung tissue for reducing viral loads in respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, to better evaluate antiviral effects of drugs that target the intestine, the stool samples should also be collected for viral RNA test in the future.

TI  - COVID-19: A review of the proposed pharmacological treatments
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The emerging pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems globally. The clinical course of COVID-19 and its ability to rapidly create widespread infection has major implications, warranting vigorous infection prevention and control measures. As the confirmed number of cases has surpassed 5.6 million worldwide and continues to grow, the potential severity of the disease and its deadly complications requires urgent development of novel therapeutic agents to both prevent and treat COVID-19. Although vaccines and specific drug therapies have yet to be discovered, ongoing research and clinical trials are being conducted to investigate the efficacy of repurposed drugs for treating COVID-19. In the present review, the drug candidates that have been suggested to treat COVID-19 will be discussed. These include anti-viral agents (remdesivir, ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir, favipiravir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, oseltamivir, umifenovir), immunomodulatory agents (tocilizumab, interferons, plasma transfusions), and adjunctive agents (azithromycin, corticosteroids), among other miscellaneous agents. The mechanisms of action and further pharmacological properties will be explored, with a particular focus on the evidence-based safety and efficacy of each agent.

TI  - Remdesivir in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment: a review of evidence
T2  - INFECTION
AB  - COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel beta-coronavirus, belonging to the same subgenus as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus. Remdesivir, an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral agent has previously demonstrated in vitro activity against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and in vivo efficacy against other related coronaviruses in animal models. Its safety profile has been tested in a compassionate use setting for patients with COVID-19. The current therapeutic studies demonstrate clinical effectiveness of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients by shortening time to clinical recovery, and hospital stay. In this review, we critically analyze the current evidence of remdesivir against COVID-19 and dissect the aspects over its safety and efficacy. Based on existing data, remdesivir can be regarded as a potential therapeutic agent against COVID-19. Further large-scale, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials are, however, awaited to validate these findings.

TI  - Potential of turmeric-derived compounds against RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2: An in-silico approach
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there are no particular antivirals available to battle with COVID-19. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has emerged as a novel drug target due to its essential role in virus replication. In this study, turmeric-derived compounds were chosen and subjected to in-silico analysis to evaluate their binding affinity against the RdRp-RNA complex of SARS-CoV-2. Our in-silico approach included the analysis of proteinligand interactions by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, followed by free energy calculations by molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area analysis. Curcumin and diacetylcurcumin showed stability and good binding affinity at the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-RNA complex. Furthermore, to validate the potency of selected compounds, we compared them with Favipiravir and Remdesivir antiviral drugs from our previous analysis on targeting tea bioactive molecules to inhibit RdRp-RNA complex. The comparative analysis revealed that the selected compounds showed higher potential to be developed as RdRpRNA inhibitors than antiviral medicines Remdesivir and Favipiravir. However, these compounds need to be further validated by in-vitro and in-vivo investigations.

TI  - Old and re-purposed drugs for the treatment of COVID-19
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTI-INFECTIVE THERAPY
AB  - Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has developed since December 2019. It has caused a global pandemic with more than three hundred thousand case fatalities. However, apart from supportive care by respirators, no standard medical therapy is validated. Areas covered This paper presents old drugs with potentialin vitroefficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Thein vitrodatabase, adverse effects, and potential toxicities of these drugs are reviewed regarding their feasibility of clinical prescription for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. To obtain convincing recommendations, we referred to opinions from the US National Institute of Health regarding drugs repurposed for COVID-19 therapy. Expert opinion Although strong evidence of well-designed randomized controlled studies regarding COVID-19 therapy is presently lacking, remdesivir, teicoplanin, hydroxychloroquine (not in combination with azithromycin), and ivermectin might be effective antiviral drugs and are deemed promising candidates for controlling SARS-CoV-2. In addition, tocilizumab might be considered as the supplementary treatment for COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome. In future, clinical trials regarding a combination of potentially effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 need to be conducted to establish the optimal regimen for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

TI  - Effect of Aprotinin and Avifavir(R) Combination Therapy for Moderate COVID-19 Patients
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - COVID-19 is a contagious multisystem inflammatory disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied the efficacy of Aprotinin (nonspecific serine proteases inhibitor) in combination with Avifavir(R) or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) drugs, which are recommended by the Russian Ministry of Health for the treatment therapy of moderate COVID-19 patients. This prospective single-center study included participants with moderate COVID-19-related pneumonia, laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and admitted to the hospitals. Patients received combinations of intravenous (IV) Aprotinin (1,000,000 KIU daily, 3 days) and HCQ (cohort 1), inhalation (inh) treatment with Aprotinin (625 KIU four times per day, 5 days) and HCQ (cohort 2) or IV Aprotinin (1,000,000 KIU daily for 5 days) and Avifavir (cohort 3). In cohorts 1-3, the combination therapy showed 100% efficacy in preventing the transfer of patients (n = 30) to the intensive care unit (ICU). The effect of the combination therapy in cohort 3 was the most prominent, and the median time to SARS-CoV-2 elimination was 3.5 days (IQR 3.0-4.0), normalization of the CRP concentration was 3.5 days (IQR 3-5), of the D-dimer concentration was 5 days (IQR 4 to 5); body temperature was 1 day (IQR 1-3), improvement in clinical status or discharge from the hospital was 5 days (IQR 5-5), and improvement in lung lesions of patients on 14 day was 100%.

TI  - Molecular docking and dynamics studies of Nicotinamide Riboside as a potential multi-target nutraceutical against SARS-CoV-2 entry, replication, and transcription: A new insight
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB  - The highly contagious Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a newborn infectious member of the dangerous betacoronaviruses (beta-CoVs) following SARS and MERS-CoVs, can be regarded as the most significant issue afflicting the whole world shortly after December 2019. Considering CoVs as RNA viruses with a single stranded RNA genome ( + ssRNA), the critical viral enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising therapeutic target for the potentially fatal infection COVID-19. Nicotinamide riboside (NR), which is a naturally occurring analogue of Niacin (vitamin B3), is expected to have therapeutic effects on COVID-19 due to its super close structural similarity to the proven RdRp inhibitors. Thus, at the first phase of the current molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies, we targeted SARSCoV-2 RdRp. On the next phase, SARS-CoV RdRp, human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, and the SARS-CoV-2 Structural Glycoproteins Spike, Nonstructural viral protein 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease, and Papain-like protease were targeted using the docking simulation to find other possible antiviral effects of NR serendipitously. In the current study, the resulted scores from molecular docking and dynamics simulations as the primary determinative factor as well as the observed reliable binding modes have demonstrated that Nicotinamide Riboside and its active metabolite NMN can target human ACE2 and IMPDH, along with the viral Spro, Mpro, PLpro, and on top of all, RdRp as a potential competitive inhibitor.

TI  - Drug repurposing: new strategies for addressing COVID-19 outbreak
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTI-INFECTIVE THERAPY
AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 outbreak has infected 34.20 million people with 1019 thousand deaths in more than 125 countries till 30 September 2020. Due to the unavailability of vaccine or targeted novel drug therapy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), screening of existential medical treatments facilitates identification of promising drugs for the treatment and management of COVID-19.
   Areas covered: The review article highlights repurposing of antiviral, antimalarial, antineoplastic, antidiabetic, analgesic, and immunomodulatory drugs. Furthermore, clinical trials, in-vitro studies, benefits, adverse effects, toxicities, mechanisms of action, and regulatory status of drugs are covered in this article.
   Expert opinion: Lack of conclusive results from randomized clinical trials indicates absence of specific drugs for treatment of COVID-19. Unavailability of complete data regarding safety, efficacy, and adverse reactions of drugs restricts the recommendation of clinical advice on dose and duration of the drug therapy. Remdesivir and favipiravir show promising outcomes but more clinical evidence is required for use in large populations. Experimental and repurposed drug therapies targeting spike and envelope proteins, Mpro, 3CL(pro) and PLpro enzymes, and RdRp and TMPRSS2 genes show capability to produce effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 action. Development of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 will offer long-term solution to terminate spread of this global pandemic.

TI  - Recovery From COVID-19 Pneumonia in a Heart Transplant Recipient A Case Report
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Solid-organ transplant patients have a high risk of severe infection related to acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2). This case represents a 54-year-old woman known as a diabetic, hypothyroidism, and a recent heart transplant recipient who presented with a 1-week history of cough and fatigue. She was hypoxic on presentation to the hospital and progressively declined and required invasive mechanical ventilation. She had respiratory distress and hypoxia and chest x-ray showed progressive bilateral chest infiltrates. She had leukopenia of 3.5 cells *10(9)/L and lymphopenia of 0.2 cells *10(9)/L. The inflammatory markers were increased: C-reactive protein, 25 mg/L; ferritin, 1106 ng/mL; lactate dehydrogenase, 632 U/L; and interleukin-6, 87 pg/mL. She was treated for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Her treatment involved supportive care with mechanical ventilation, convalescent plasma transfusion, antiviral therapy with favipiravir, intravenous dexamethasone, and reduction of immune suppression medication. This case had a successful recovery through multidisciplinary team management. Solid-organ transplant recipients are a high-risk population who need an individualized care plan for the optimization of immunosuppressive medication and treatment of the COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Lessons Learned so Far from the Pandemic: A Review on Pregnants and Neonates with COVID-19
T2  - EURASIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB  - There are concerns regarding the risk and the course of COVID-19 in pregnancy and in the neonates. In this review, we aimed to present the current understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy and neonatal periods considering diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention. Few studies on pregnant women with COVID-19 have been conducted between December 2019 and April 2020. The majority of patients applied in the third trimester and presented with fever and cough. Ground-glass opacities and consolidation on computed tomography were reported to be common. COVID-19 was proposed to have a milder course than SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in pregnant women. Hydroxychloroquine and antiproteases (lopinavir/ritonavir) were reported to be safe; however, therapeutic efficacy and safety of remdesivir still lack evidence. As ribavirin and favipiravir have teratogenic effects, there are some debates on the use of ribavirin in severe cases. There is still no clear evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during delivery. Occupational safety issues of pregnant healthcare workers on the frontline should be considered as their risk to develop severe pneumonia is higher because of altered maternal immune response. Knowledge about neonatal outcomes of COVID-19 was based on studies of the last trimester of pregnancy. There is much to be learnt about COVID-19 in pregnant women and in the neonates, especially concerning prognosis- and treatment-related issues.

TI  - Protease Inhibitors: Candidate Drugs to Inhibit Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Replication
T2  - TOHOKU JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - The number of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly increased, although the WHO declared a pandemic. However, drugs that function against SARS-CoV-2 have not been established. SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor of the SARS coronavirus. SARS coronavirus and coronavirus 229E, the cause of the common cold, replicate through cell-surface and endosomal pathways using a protease, the type II transmembrane protease. To examine the effects of protease inhibitors on the replication of coronavirus 229E, we pretreated primary cultures of human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells with camostat or nafamostat, each of which has been used for the treatment of pancreatitis and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation. HNE cells were then infected with coronavirus 229E, and viral titers in the airway surface liquid of the cells were examined. Pretreatment with camostat (0.1-10 mu g/mL) or nafamostat (0.01-1 mu g/mL) reduced the titers of coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, a significant amount of type II transmembrane protease protein was detected in the airway surface liquid of HNE cells. Additionally, interferons have been reported to have antiviral effects against SARS coronavirus. The additive effects of interferons on the inhibitory effects of other candidate drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir, have also been studied. These findings suggest that protease inhibitors of this type may inhibit coronavirus 229E replication in human airway epithelial cells at clinical concentrations. Protease inhibitors, interferons or the combination of these drugs may become candidate drugs to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - COVID-19 pneumonia suspected to be co-infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and improved by early administration of favipiravir and ciclesonide
T2  - RESPIROLOGY CASE REPORTS
AB  - A female nurse in her 40s caring for a patient with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia treated with a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) presented with fever, cough and dyspnoea. Based on imaging findings and a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed, although her cohabiting family had similar symptoms and their RT-PCR tests were negative. Laboratory results showed Mycoplasma antigen (+). She was started on ciclesonide 1200 mu g/day and favipiravir (3600 mg/day on the first day and 1600 mg/day from Day 2). As Mycoplasma antigen was positive on admission and her family had similar symptoms, levofloxacin 500 mg/day was started. The patient recovered and was discharged on Day 10. The patient did not have Mycoplasma infection because the Mycoplasma antibody measured by particle agglutination (PA) method was increased only up to 80 times after 4 weeks. This case highlights that healthcare workers wearing full personal protective equipment can nevertheless acquire COVID-19 from patients treated with HFNCs.

TI  - Carvacrol, a Plant Metabolite Targeting Viral Protease (M-pro) and ACE2 in Host Cells Can Be a Possible Candidate for COVID-19
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December 2019, resulting in the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Coronaviruses are solely accountable for rising mortality and socioeconomic saddles. Presently, there are few repurposed drugs such as remdesivir or favipiravir approved for the treatment of COVID-19, although vaccines and plasma therapy is also subject to emergency approval. However, some potential natural treatments and cures have also been proposed. Molecules of natural origin showed therapeutic importance such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity, and could be useful drug candidates for treating COVID-19. In recent years, essential oils have shown promising therapeutic effects against many viral diseases. Carvacrol is one of the monoterpene phenol with abundant presence in essential oils of many aromatic plants, including thyme and oregano. It is being used as food flavoring, additive, and preservatives. Carvacrol is also used as a fragrance in cosmetic products. A number of research studies have shown biological actions of carvacrol with its therapeutic potential is of clinical significance. The in vitro and in vivo studies have shown multiple pharmacological properties such as anticancer, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasorelaxant, hepatoprotective, and spasmolytic. This review highlights the various biological and pharmacological properties of carvacrol within the scope of COVID-19.

TI  - A guide to COVID-19 antiviral therapeutics: a summary and perspective of the antiviral weapons against SARS-CoV-2 infection
T2  - FEBS JOURNAL
AB  - Antiviral therapies are integral in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 (i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the causative agent of COVID-19. Antiviral therapeutics can be divided into categories based on how they combat the virus, including viral entry into the host cell, viral replication, protein trafficking, post-translational processing, and immune response regulation. Drugs that target how the virus enters the cell include: Evusheld, REGEN-COV, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, bebtelovimab, sotrovimab, Arbidol, nitazoxanide, and chloroquine. Drugs that prevent the virus from replicating include: Paxlovid, remdesivir, molnupiravir, favipiravir, ribavirin, and Kaletra. Drugs that interfere with protein trafficking and post-translational processing include nitazoxanide and ivermectin. Lastly, drugs that target immune response regulation include interferons and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as dexamethasone. Antiviral therapies offer an alternative solution for those unable or unwilling to be vaccinated and are a vital weapon in the battle against the global pandemic. Learning more about these therapies helps raise awareness in the general population about the options available to them with respect to aiding in the reduction of the severity of COVID-19 infection. In this 'A Guide To' article, we provide an in-depth insight into the development of antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and their ability to help fight COVID-19.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of antiviral agents against coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials
T2  - JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - Despite aggressive efforts on containment measures for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic around the world, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuously spreading. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an effective antiviral agent. To date, considerable research has been conducted to develop different approaches to COVID-19 therapy. In addition to early observational studies, which could be limited by study design, small sample size, non-randomized design, or different timings of treatment, an increasing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the clinical efficacy and safety of antiviral agents are being carried out. This study reviews the updated findings of RCTs regarding the clinical efficacy of eight antiviral agents against COVID19, including remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, baloxavir, umifenovir, darunavir/cobicistat, and their combinations. Treatment with remdesivir could accelerate clinical improvement; however, it lacked additional survival benefits. Moreover, 5-day regimen of remdesivir might show adequate effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Favipiravir was only marginally effective regarding clinical improvement and virological assessment based on the results of small RCTs. The present evidence suggests that sofosbuvir/daclatasvir may improve survival and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. However, the sample sizes for analysis were relatively small, and all studies were exclusively conducted in Iran. Further larger RCTs in other countries are warranted to support these findings. In contrast, the present findings of limited RCTs did not indicate the use of lopinavir/ritonavir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, baloxavir, umifenovir, and darunavir/cobicistat in the treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Favipiravir in Moderate COVID-19 Pneumonia Patients without Oxygen Therapy: A Randomized, Phase III Clinical Trial
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THERAPY
AB  - Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus. Favipiravir is an orally administrable antiviral drug whose mechanism of action is to selectively inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A preliminary trial in COVID-19 patients reported significant improvements across a multitude of clinical parameters, but these findings have not been confirmed in an adequate well-controlled trial. We conducted a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial assessing the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in patients with moderate pneumonia not requiring oxygen therapy. Methods COVID-19 patients with moderate pneumonia (SpO(2) >= 94%) within 10 days of onset of fever (temperature >= 37.5 degrees C) were assigned to receive either placebo or favipiravir (1800 mg twice a day on Day 1, followed by 800 mg twice a day for up to 13 days) in a ratio of 1:2. An adaptive design was used to re-estimate the sample size. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome defined as the time to improvement in temperature, oxygen saturation levels (SpO(2)), and findings on chest imaging, and recovery to SARS-CoV-2-negative. This endpoint was re-examined by the Central Committee under blinded conditions. Results A total of 156 patients were randomized. The median time of the primary endpoint was 11.9 days in the favipiravir group and 14.7 days in the placebo group, with a significant difference (p = 0.0136). Favipiravir-treated patients with known risk factors such as obesity or coexisting conditions provided better effects. Furthermore, patients with early-onset in the favipiravir group showed higher odds ratio. No deaths were documented. Although adverse events in the favipiravir group were predominantly transient, the incidence was significantly higher. Conclusions The results suggested favipiravir may be one of options for moderate COVID-19 pneumonia treatment. However, the risk of adverse events, including hyperuricemia, should be carefully considered.

TI  - Co-administration of Favipiravir and the Remdesivir Metabolite GS-441524 Effectively Reduces SARS-CoV-2 Replication in the Lungs of the Syrian Hamster Model
T2  - MBIO
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide since December 2019, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although vaccines for this virus have been developed rapidly, repurposing drugs approved to treat other diseases remains an invaluable treatment strategy. Here, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of drugs on SARS-CoV-2 replication in a hamster infection model and in in vitro assays. Favipiravir significantly suppressed virus replication in hamster lungs. Remdesivir inhibited virus replication in vitro, but was not effective in the hamster model. However, GS-441524, a metabolite of remdesivir, effectively suppressed virus replication in hamsters. Co-administration of favipiravir and GS-441524 more efficiently reduced virus load in hamster lungs than did single administration of either drug for both the prophylactic and therapeutic regimens; prophylactic co-administration also efficiently inhibited lung inflammation in the infected animals. Furthermore, pretreatment of hamsters with favipiravir and GS-441524 effectively protected them from virus transmission via respiratory droplets upon exposure to infected hamsters. Repurposing and co-administration of antiviral drugs may help combat COVID-19.
   IMPORTANCE During a pandemic, repurposing drugs that are approved for other diseases is a quick and realistic treatment option. In this study, we found that co administration of favipiravir and the remdesivir metabolite GS-441524 more effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs of Syrian hamsters than either favipiravir or GS-441524 alone as part of a prophylactic or therapeutic regimen. Prophylactic co-administration also reduced the severity of lung inflammation. Moreover, co-administration of these drugs to naive hamsters efficiently protected them from airborne transmission of the virus from infected animals. Since both drugs are nucleotide analogs that interfere with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of many RNA viruses, these findings may also help encourage co-administration of antivirals to combat future pandemics.

TI  - Antiviral therapy for COVID-19: Derivation of optimal strategy based on past antiviral and favipiravir experiences
T2  - PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Available online 01 February 2022 Favipiravir, a broad-spectrum RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, inhibits the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at significantly lower concentrations than the plasma trough levels achieved by the dosage adopted for influenza treatment and exhibits efficacy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Although high doses of favipiravir are required due to the molecule being a purine analog, its conversion into the active form in infected cells with active viral RNA synthesis enhances the antiviral specificity and selectivity as a chain terminator with lethal mutagenesis. Another characteristic feature is the lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant virus. COVID-19 pneumonia is caused by strong cell-mediated immunity against virus-infected cells, and the inflammatory response induced by adaptive immunity continues to peak for 3 to 5 days despite antiviral treatment. This has also been observed in herpes zoster (HZ) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia. Inflammation due to an immune response may mask the effectiveness of favipiravir against COVID-19 pneumonia. Favipiravir significantly shortened the recovery time in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia by 3 days with the start of treatment by the 5th day of symptom onset. Since both CMV and COVID-19 pneumonia are caused by adaptive immunity and prevention of cytomegalovirus pneumonia is the standard treatment due to difficulties in treating refractory CMV pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia should be prevented with early treatment as well. In the present study, we have comprehensively reviewed the optimal antiviral therapy for COVID-19 based on clinical trials of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia and the concurrently established therapies for other viral infections, particularly HZ and CMV pneumonia. Optimally, antivirals should be administered immediately after COVID-19 diagnosis, similar to that after influenza diagnosis, to prevent COVID-19 pneumonia and complications resulting from microangiopathy.

TI  - Favipiravir at high doses has potent antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, whereas hydroxychloroquine lacks activity
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread around the globe after its emergence in Wuhan in December 2019. With no specific therapeutic and prophylactic options available, the virus has infected millions of people of which more than half a million succumbed to the viral disease, COVID-19. The urgent need for an effective treatment together with a lack of small animal infection models has led to clinical trials using repurposed drugs without preclinical evidence of their in vivo efficacy. We established an infection model in Syrian hamsters to evaluate the efficacy of small molecules on both infection and transmission. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters with a low dose of favipiravir or hydroxychloroquine with(out) azithromycin resulted in, respectively, a mild or no reduction in virus levels. However, high doses of favipiravir significantly reduced infectious virus titers in the lungs and markedly improved lung histopathology. Moreover, a high dose of favipiravir decreased virus transmission by direct contact, whereas hydroxychloroquine failed as prophylaxis. Pharmacokinetic modeling of hydroxychloroquine suggested that the total lung exposure to the drug did not cause the failure. Our data on hydroxychloroquine (together with previous reports in macaques and ferrets) thus provide no scientific basis for the use of this drug in COVID-19 patients. In contrast, the results with favipiravir demonstrate that an antiviral drug at nontoxic doses exhibits a marked protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 in a small animal model. Clinical studies are required to assess whether a similar antiviral effect is achievable in humans without toxic effects.

TI  - Review of registered clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19
T2  - DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, but now more than 200 countries have been affected and the coronavirus pandemic is still ongoing. The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from mild to severe. FDA approved remdesivir as a treatment of COVID-19 so far. Various clinical trials are underway to find an effective method to treat patients with COVID-19. This review aimed at summarizing 219 registered clinical trials in the ClinicalTrials.gov database with possible mechanisms, and novel findings of them, and other recent publications related to COVID-19. According to our analyses, various treatment approaches and drugs are being investigated to find an effective drug to cure COVID-19 and among all strategies, three important mechanisms are suggested to be important against COVID-19 including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Our review can help future studies get on the way to finding an effective drug for COVID-19 treatment by providing ideas for similar researches.

TI  - Safety profile of COVID-19 drugs in a real clinical setting
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Purpose The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has affected millions all over the world and has been declared pandemic, as of 11 March 2020. In addition to the ongoing research and development of vaccines, there is still a dire need for safe and effective drugs for the control and treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Numerous repurposed drugs are under clinical investigations whose reported adverse events can raise worries about their safety. The aim of this review is to illuminate the associated adverse events related to the drugs used in a real COVID-19 setting along with their relevant mechanism(s). Method Through a literature search conducted on PubMed and Google Scholar database, various adverse events suspected to be induced by eight drugs, including dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ivermectin, and tocilizumab, administered in COVID-19 patients in clinical practice and studies were identified in 30 case reports, 3 case series, and 10 randomized clinical trials. Results Mild, moderate, or severe adverse events of numerous repurposed and investigational drugs caused by various factors and mechanisms were observed. Gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting were the most frequently followed by cardiovascular, cutaneous, and hepatic adverse events. Few other rare adverse drug reactions were also observed. Conclusion In light of their ineffectiveness against COVID-19 as evident in large clinical studies, drugs including hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ivermectin should neither be used routinely nor in clinical studies. While lack of sufficient data, it creates doubt regarding the reliability of chloroquine and favipiravir use in COVID-19 patients. Hence, these two drugs can only be used in clinical studies. In contrast, ample well-conducted studies have approved the use of remdesivir, tocilizumab, and dexamethasone under certain conditions in COVID-19 patients. Consequently, it is significant to establish a strong surveillance system in order to monitor the proper safety and toxicity profile of the potential anti-COVID-19 drugs with good clinical outcomes.

TI  - Two cases of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) with transient viral elevation using semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR and symptom relapse after completion of 10 days of favipiravir treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, is spreading around the world and causing many deaths, mainly from pneumonia. Currently, there are no specific drugs to treat COVID-19, and existing antiviral drugs are being used as an alternative. One of these is favipiravir, a new type of influenza drug. However, its efficacy, dosage, and duration of administration are still under study. In this case study, we administered favipiravir to patients with COVID-19 and determined the viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the COVID-19 pathogen, using semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR in sputum samples. We report on two patients in whom the viral load increased again after completion of 10 days of favipiravir treatment and a transient relapse of symptoms was observed.

TI  - Theory and reality of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
AB  - At present, over 180 million people have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide and there have been more than 3.8 million deaths due to the virus. However, specific effective antiviral treatment for this infectious disease is absent. At the beginning of the epidemic, relevant cellular and animal experiments of antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 were conducted based on the prior studies of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Some antivirals were preliminarily validated to be potentially effective in the clinical settings. But as the epidemic continued and more studies were carried out, the efficacy of these antiviral drugs became controversial. This paper reviews the pharmacology and application of interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine, arbidol, favipiravir, remdesivir, and thymosin alpha 1 in coronavirus disease 2019. The actual effect of these drugs remains controversial. Meanwhile, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 still need to be explored.

TI  - Pharmacological and nonpharmacological studies on coronavirus disease 2019: A mini-review of the recent evidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PHARMACY PRACTICE
AB  - Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) is an extremely transmittable microbial infection that has emerged in Wuhan (China) in late 2019, leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 syndrome, and caused a pandemic all over the globe. This study is a systematic review of all 927 clinical trial studies performed worldwide from the beginning of the COVID-19 mysterious pandemic in China. These researches have registered in different databases. According to the best of our knowledge, China (74.82%), the United States (4.49%), and France (2.72%) have the most significant number of clinical trials, respectively. Clinical trials can be randomized or nonrandomized. Due to our results, 32.58% of studies were randomized, and 7.12% were not randomized. Most of the studies were open-labeled studies (22.44%), and double-blinded (4.42%) and quadruple blinded (2.48%) studies stand in second and third place regarding the number of trials, respectively. The direction and quantity of clinical trials attempted to identify a possible cure for COVID-19 demonstrates the depth of this crisis. As we are writing this article, a significant international endeavor will find a cure or vaccine for containing this devastating and mysterious disease.

TI  - Type 1 Brugada Type-ECG Pattern Provoked by Fever in a Patient with COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL & INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) related coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Brugada Syndrome (BrS) has been shown to occur spontaneously in patients with a viral infection, and the fever is the culprit trigger in the underlying mechanism. Herein, we described a patient who presented with syncope and Brugada-type electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern and diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient was taken to the intensive care unit for continuous ECG recording and monitoring. Favipiravir, low molecular weight heparin, high flow oxygen therapy, and antipyretic therapy were initiated. Brugada-type ECG pattern was disappeared with a resolution of fever. ECG findings of BrS may occur during fever and may lead to life-threatening arrhythmic events in unknown subjects. This clinical condition may require a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in some patients. ECG should be a part of clinical evaluation in patients with COVID-19 even though without syncope.

TI  - Neurological Consequences of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Concurrence of Treatment-Induced Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events in COVID-19 Patients: Navigating the Uncharted
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and invade the human cells to cause COVID-19-related pneumonia. Despite an emphasis on respiratory complications, the evidence of neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly growing, which is substantially contributing to morbidity and mortality. The neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may have several pathophysiological underpinnings, which are yet to be explored. Hypothetically, SARS-CoV-2 may affect the central nervous system (CNS) either by direct mechanisms like neuronal retrograde dissemination and hematogenous dissemination, or via indirect pathways. CNS complications associated with COVID-19 include encephalitis, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, diffuse leukoencephalopathy, stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic), venous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. These may result from different mechanisms, including direct virus infection of the CNS, virus-induced hyper-inflammatory states, and post-infection immune responses. On the other hand, the Guillain-Barre syndrome, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and myopathy are the outcomes of peripheral nervous system injury. Although the therapeutic potential of certain repurposed drugs has led to their off-label use against COVID-19, such as anti-retroviral drugs (remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir-ritonavir combination), biologics (tocilizumab), antibiotics (azithromycin), antiparasitics (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), and corticosteroids (dexamethasone), unfortunately, the associated clinical neuropsychiatric adverse events remains a critical issue. Therefore, COVID-19 represents a major threat to the field of neuropsychiatry, as both the virus and the potential therapies may induce neurologic as well as psychiatric disorders. Notably, potential COVID-19 medications may also interact with the medications of pre-existing neuropsychiatric diseases, thereby further complicating the condition. From this perspective, this review will discuss the possible neurological manifestations and sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection with emphasis on the probable underlying neurotropic mechanisms. Additionally, we will highlight the concurrence of COVID-19 treatment-associated neuropsychiatric events and possible clinically relevant drug interactions, to provide a useful framework and help researchers, especially the neurologists in understanding the neurologic facets of the ongoing pandemic to control the morbidity and mortality.

TI  - An effective drug against COVID-19: reality or dream?
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is well known as a novel member of the coronavirus family which caused a sudden outbreak of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in China that quickly developed into a global pandemic. No effective approaches are found as yet for the therapy and epidemiological control of this new virus. We searched the literature in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and MeSH, for articles and abstracts describing SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, pneumonia, clinical trials, drug, treatment, and medicine.
   Areas covered: The present study aimed to comprehensively overview the current literature on effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.
   Expert opinion: Since the beginning of this pandemic disease, many studies have been conducted to find effective drugs to prevent COVID-19, because there are no specific drugs for the treatment of this disease. Most of these drugs with the antiviral potential effect toward COVID-19 are already used as the treatment of other infectious diseases. Some drugs that show the promising therapeutic potential in the initial clinical studies include remdesivir as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and favipiravir as an inhibitor of virus replication. Currently, remdesivir received the FDA authorizes to use as an experimental drug for emergency use in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Advances in the treatment of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine: a narrative review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
AB  - In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered. Since its emergence, COVID-19 has been outbreaking rapidly worldwide, where the virus has so far caused the death of hundreds of thousands and infected more than a million, what has been called a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the WHO-Coronavirus disease 2019 Situation Report-142, by June 10, 2020, there are 7,145,539 confirmed cases and 408,025 deaths. There is an urgent need to develop a suitable specific medicine against this novel coronavirus; therefore, scientists and researchers around the world are making great efforts endeavoring to discover an efficient specific medication for COVID-19 treatment. Given the similarity of the novel coronavirus with previous epidemic viruses, namely, the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), previously tested drugs could potentially work against the novel coronavirus. In this narrative review, we aim to summarize and discuss the effectiveness of current Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine options for COVID-19 treatment based on the overview of the scientific literature. Some Western medicines including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and arbidol, as well as some traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) such as Qingfei Paidu decoction, Yupingfeng, Lianhua Qingwen, and TCM injections have revealed a relative activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, in observational studies, and in clinical trials. However, further extensive studies and clinical trials including double-blind and randomized clinical trials, with a higher number of patients, are necessary to confirm the activity of these medicines. There are several ongoing trials conducted on the drugs of COVID-19, and the results are urgently needed to make a suitable treatment recommendation.

TI  - Assessment and management of the SARS-CoV-2 infection: A secondary center experience
T2  - ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND ANALYTICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the management and outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a secondary hospital.
   Material and Methods: This study included 699 hospitalized patients who had positive rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and/or typical findings of COVID-19 on chest computed tomography (CT). Demographics, comorbidities, initial laboratory tests on admission, treatment modalities, complications and outcomes were evaluated retrospectively.
   Results: The mean age was 57.0 +/- 15.6 (range:16-94 years), and male to female ratio was 1.24; 58.7% of the patients had at least one underlying comorbidity, the most common was hypertension; 18.1% of the patients had lymphopenia, 35.7% hyperferritinemia, 58.3% had increased lactate dehydrogenase, and 58.5% had increased D-dimer. Chest CT revealed moderate and severe stages in 57.9% of the patients. Hydroxychloroquine was given to 37.2% and favipiravir to 67.1% of the patients. No significant difference was observed between treatment groups in terms of mortality (P=0.487); 5.8% of the patients were transferred to the ICU, 75.6% of whom needed non-invasive and 36.5% invasive mechanical ventilation. The overall case-fatality rate was 0.9.
   Discussion: Older age, male gender, low lymphocyte count, CT findings, including bilateral involvement and severe stage were significantly associated with poor prognosis and mortality.

TI  - Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load Response among COVID-19 Patients Receiving Favipiravir
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - We retrospectively studied nasopharyngeal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who were hospitalized between January 13 and April 1, 2020. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted using primers and probes targeting the ORFlab and N genes. All patients were classified in the following groups: Group 1: received favipiravir + chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir for 5-10 days, Group 2: received chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir for 5-10 days, and Group 3: no antiviral medication. Among the 115 patients, 38 (33%), 54 (47%), and 23 (20%) were in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median (IQR) baseline viral loads on day 0 of Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 7.2 (6.0-8.1), 6.9 (5.8-7.8), and 6.9 (5.8-7.6) log(10) copies/mL, respectively. The reductions of mean viral loads on day 3 from baseline were 2.41, 1.38, and 2.19 log(10) copies/mL in the corresponding groups (P < 0.05). There were no differences in the reduction of mean viral loads from baseline among the three groups on days 5 and 10 (P > 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that receiving favipiravir was associated with nasopharyngeal viral load reduction at three days (P = 0.001). Significant nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduction was achieved in COVID-19 patients who received a favipiravir-containing regimen.

TI  - RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase as a Target for COVID-19 Drug Discovery
T2  - SLAS DISCOVERY
AB  - COVID-19 respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global health issue since it emerged in December 2019. While great global efforts are underway to develop vaccines and to discover or repurpose therapeutic agents for this disease, as of this writing only the nucleoside drug remdesivir has been approved under Emergency Use Authorization to treat COVID-19. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a viral enzyme for viral RNA replication in host cells, is one of the most intriguing and promising drug targets for SARS-CoV-2 drug development. Because RdRP is a viral enzyme with no host cell homologs, selective SARS-CoV-2 RdRP inhibitors can be developed that have improved potency and fewer off-target effects against human host proteins and thus are safer and more effective therapeutics for treating COVID-19. This review focuses on biochemical enzyme and cell-based assays for RdRPs that could be used in high-throughput screening to discover new and repurposed drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Structural analogues of existing anti-viral drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase: A computational hierarchical investigation
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became a pandemic, resulting in an exponentially increased mortality globally and scientists all over the world are struggling to find suitable solutions to combat it. Multiple repurposed drugs have already been in several clinical trials or recently completed. However, none of them shows any promising effect in combating COVID-19. Therefore, developing an effective drug is an unmet global need. RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Therefore, it is considered as a prime target of drugs that may treat COVID-19. In this study, we have screened a library of compounds, containing approved RdRp inhibitor drugs that were or in use to treat other viruses (favipiravir, sofosbuvir, ribavirin, lopinavir, tenofovir, ritonavir, galidesivir and remdesivir) and their structural analogues, in order to identify potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Extensive screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics show that five structural analogues have notable inhibitory effects against RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, comparative protein-antagonists interaction revealed that these compounds fit well in the pocket of RdRp. ADMET analysis of these compounds suggests their potency as drug candidates. Our identified compounds may serve as potential therapeutics for COVID-19.

TI  - Clinical course of a critically ill patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL ORGANS
AB  - Although several studies have reported on the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), clinical course of the most severe cases requiring treatment in ICU have been insufficiently reported. A 73-year-old man traveling on a cruise ship with history of hypertension and dyslipidemia developed high fever, dyspnea and cough after 7 days of steroid treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in sputa polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examination. His respiratory function deteriorated despite treatments with lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, azithromycin and meropenem at a regional hospital. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU in the tertiary university hospital on day 10 (ICU day 1). Interferon beta-1b subcutaneous injection was initiated immediately to enhance anti-viral therapy, and favipiravir on ICU day 10 upon availability. Progression of organ dysfunctions necessitated inhalation of nitrogen oxide for respiratory dysfunction, noradrenaline for cardiovascular dysfunction and continuous renal replacement therapy for renal dysfunction. His blood samples PCR also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, indicating viremia, concomitantly with elevated IL-6 levels. VV-ECMO was initiated after sudden exacerbation of respiratory dysfunction on ICU day 7 to maintain oxygenation. The sustained excessive inflammatory cytokines in the present case might have led to the exacerbation of the disease, requiring vigorous organ support therapies to allow for survival and recovery from the rapid progression of multiple organ dysfunctions and severe respiratory failure.

TI  - Experimental Treatment with Favipiravir for COVID-19: An Open-Label Control Study
T2  - ENGINEERING
AB  - There is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 16% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the fatality ratio was 1%-2%. No specific treatment has been reported. Herein, we examined the effects of favipiravir (FPV) versus lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) for the treatment of COVID-19. Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; Days 2-14: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon (IFN)-alpha by aerosol inhalation (5 million international unit (IU) twice daily) were included in the FPV arm of this study, whereas patients who were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1-14: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus IFN-alpha by aerosol inhalation (5 million IU twice daily) were included in the control arm. Changes in chest computed tomography (CT), viral clearance, and drug safety were compared between the two groups. For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. A shorter viral clearance median time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (4 d (interquartile range (IQR): 2.5-9) versus 11 d (IQR: 8-13), P < 0.001). The FPV arm also showed significant improvement in chest CT compared with the control arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P = 0.004). After adjustment for potential confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly higher improvement rate in chest CT. Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with faster viral clearance. In addition, fewer adverse events were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm. In this open-label before-after controlled study, FPV showed better therapeutic responses on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance. These preliminary clinical results provide useful information of treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection. (c) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

TI  - An overview of the safety, clinical application and antiviral research of the COVID-19 therapeutics
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Since a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in late December 2019, coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) epidemic has gradually spread worldwide, becoming a major public health event. No specific antivirals are currently available for COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The treatments for COVID-19 are mainly based on the experiences of similar virus such SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HIV and influenza viruses. Scientists have taken great efforts to investigate the effective methods for the treatment of COVID-19. Up to now, there are over 1000 clinical studies for COVID-19 all over the world. In this article, we reviewed the current options for COVID-19 therapy including small molecules such as Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir etc, peptide inhibitors of ACE2, Traditional Chinese Medicines and Biologics such as SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies, mesenchymal stem cells and vaccines etc. Meanwhile, we systematically reviewed their clinical safety, clinical applications and progress of antiviral researches. The therapeutic effect of these antiviral drugs is summarized and compared, hoping to provide some ideas for clinical options of COVID-19 treatment and also provide experiences for the life-threatening virus diseases in the future.

TI  - Successful deceased donor kidney transplantation to a recipient with a history of COVID-19 treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Case presentation.
   A 49-year-old Asian male, who had undergone hemodialysis for >16 years, complained of a fever, dysgeusia and dysosmia, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia based on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction (SARS-CoV-2 PCR) and computed tomography (CT). Treatment was started with oral favipiravir and ciclesonide inhalation. On the 10th day of treatment, the patient had a persistent high fever and a chest CT showed exacerbation of pneumonia, so dexamethasone was intravenously started. He was discharged after confirming two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. Three months after COVID-19 treatment, a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was negative and he underwent a deceased donor kidney transplantation. Basiliximab induction with triple drug immunosuppression consisting of extended-release tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone, which is our regular immunosuppression protocol, was used. He was discharged on postoperative day 18 without the need for postoperative hemodialysis or any complications. The serum creatinine level was 1.72 mg/dL 95 days postoperatively and he had a favorable clinical course that was similar to deceased donor kidney recipients without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
   Conclusion. We report the first case of a kidney transplantation after COVID-19 treatment in Japan and the fourth case globally. We would like to provide information about our successful case due to the anticipated increase in similar candidates in the near future.

TI  - Favipiravir in Patients With Early Mild-to-moderate Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Favipiravir has been endorsed and widely used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) around the world. Data from adequately powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is lacking. Our double-blind RCT demonstrates a lack of efficacy of favipiravir in mitigating COVID-19 symptoms, preventing progression, and shutting viral shedding.
   Background Despite vaccination, many remain vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications. Oral antivirals to prevent COVID-19 progression are vital. Based on perceived potency and clinical efficacy, favipiravir is widely used to treat COVID-19. Evidence from large randomized controlled trials (RCT) is lacking. Methods In this multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled RCT, adults with early mild-to-moderate COVID-19 were 1:1 randomized to favipiravir or placebo. The study evaluated time to sustained clinical recovery (TT-SCR), COVID-19 progression, and cessation of viral shedding. Results Of 1187 analyzed patients across 40 centers, 83.3% were Hispanic, 89.0% unvaccinated, 70.3% severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seronegative, and 77.8% had risk factors for COVID-19 progression. The median time from symptom presentation and from positive test to randomization was 3 and 2 days, respectively. There was no difference in TT-SCR (median of 7 days for both groups; P = .80), COVID-19 progression [11 patients each (1.9% vs 1.8%); P = .96], time to undetectable virus (median = 6 days, 95% confidence interval [CI] [6-8] vs 7 days, 95% CI [6-9]), or in undetectable virus by end of therapy (73.4% vs 72.3%; P = .94). Outcomes were consistent across the analyzed sub-groups. Adverse events were observed in 13.8% and 14.8% of favipiravir-treated and placebo-treated subjects, respectively. Uric acid elevation was more frequent among favipiravir-treated subjects (19.9% vs 2.8%). Conclusions Favipiravir was well tolerated but lacked efficacy in TT-SCR, progression to severe COVID-19, or cessation of viral shedding and should not be used to treat patients with COVID-19.

T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is declared as an international emergency in 2020. Its prevalence and fatality rate are rapidly increasing but the medication options are still limited for this perilous disease. The emergent outbreak of COVID-19 triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps propagating globally. The present scenario has emphasized the requirement for therapeutic opportunities to relive and overcome this latest pandemic. Despite the fact, the deteriorating developments of COVID-19. there is no drug certified to have considerable effects in the medical treatment for COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 pandemic requests for the rapid testing of new treatment approaches. Based on the evidence. hydroxychloroquine is the first medicine opted for the treatment of disease, Umifenovir, remdesivir, and favipiravir are deemed the most hopeful antiviral agent by improving the health of infected patients. The dexamethasone is a first known steroid medicine that can save the lives of seriously ill patients, and it is shown in a randomized clinical trial by the United Kingdom that it reduced the death rate in COVID-19 patients. The current review recapitulates the existing evidence of possible therapeutic drugs. peptides, humanized antibodies, convulsant plasma, and vaccination that has revealed potential in fighting COVID-19 infections. Many randomized and controlled clinical trials are taking place to further validate these agent's safety and effectiveness in curing COVID-19.

TI  - The race to treat COVID-19: Potential therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - The unforeseen emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the Wuhan province of China in December 2019, subsequently its abrupt spread across the world has severely affected human life. In a short span of time, COVID-19 has sacked more than one million human lives and marked as a severe global pandemic, which is drastically accountable for the adverse effect directly to the human society, particularly the health care system and the economy. The unavailability of approved and effective drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 further created conditions more adverse and terrifying. To win the war against this pandemic within time there is a desperate need for the most adequate therapeutic treatment, which can be achieved by the collaborative research work among scientists worldwide. In continuation of our efforts to support the scientific community, a review has been presented which discusses the structure and the activity of numerous molecules exhibiting promising SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs inhibition activities. Furthermore, this review offers an overview of the structure, a plausible mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, and crucial structural features substantial to inhibit the primary virus-based and host-based targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 treatment. We anticipate optimistically that this perspective will provide the reader and researcher's better understanding regarding COVID-19 and pave the path in the direction of COVID-19 drug discovery and development paradigm.

TI  - State-of-the-Art Molecular Dynamics Simulation Studies of RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase of SARS-CoV-2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are powerful theoretical methods that can reveal biomolecular properties, such as structure, fluctuations, and ligand binding, at the level of atomic detail. In this review article, recent MD simulation studies on these biomolecular properties of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is a multidomain protein, of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are presented. Although the tertiary structures of RdRps in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are almost identical, the RNA synthesis activity of RdRp of SARS-CoV is higher than SARS-CoV-2. Recent MD simulations observed a difference in the dynamic properties of the two RdRps, which may cause activity differences. RdRp is also a drug target for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nucleotide analogs, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, are considered to be taken up by RdRp and inhibit RNA replication. Recent MD simulations revealed the recognition mechanism of RdRp for these drug molecules and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The ligand-recognition ability of RdRp decreases in the order of remdesivir, favipiravir, and ATP. As a typical recognition process, it was found that several lysine residues of RdRp transfer these ligand molecules to the binding site such as a "bucket brigade." This finding will contribute to understanding the mechanism of the efficient ligand recognition by RdRp. In addition, various simulation studies on the complexes of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp with several nucleotide analogs are reviewed, and the molecular mechanisms by which these compounds inhibit the function of RdRp are discussed. The simulation studies presented in this review will provide useful insights into how nucleotide analogs are recognized by RdRp and inhibit the RNA replication.

TI  - Cerebral venous thrombosis in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy: A case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and is ongoing pandemic. While a majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection shows asymptomatic or mild disease, hospitalized patients can develop critical condition, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. Some cases deteriorate into sever systemic disease and multiorgan failure. Many patients of severe COVID-19 show hypercoagulable state and complicate with venous thromboembolism and atrial thrombosis. We herein reported a case of COVID-19 who developed cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) co-incidence with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). A 56-year-old Japanese man was presented with fever and malaise and diagnosed with COVID-19. He was treated with ciclesonide and azithromycin, but his respiratory condition deteriorated. Thus, systemic corticosteroids and favipiravir were initiated and these treatments resulted in afebrile state, improving malaise and respiratory failure. However, he suddenly developed severe headache and vomiting with increased concentration of D-dimer. Brain CT and MRI showed typical images of CVT in the left transvers sinus and CT pulmonary angiography showed PE. Administration of unfractionated heparin followed by edoxaban treatment reduced the levels of D-dimer and improved his clinical presentation and thrombosis. Monitoring coagulopathy is important in COVID-19 patients and in case of venous thromboembolism, including cerebral venous system, appropriate anticoagulant therapy should be initiated.

TI  - Novel corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic: current status and possible strategies for detection and treatment of the disease
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTI-INFECTIVE THERAPY
AB  - Introduction: In December 2019, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak occurred and caused the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which affected similar to 190 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
   Area covered: In the review, a comprehensive analysis of the recent developments of the COVID-19 pandemic has been provided, including the structural characterization of the virus, the current worldwide status of the disease, various detection strategies, drugs recommended for the effective treatment, and progress of vaccine development programs by different countries. This report was constructed by following a systematic literature search of bibliographic databases of published reports of relevance until 1 September 2020.
   Expert opinion: Currently, the countries are opening businesses despite a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases. The pharmaceutical industries are developing clinical diagnostic kits, medicines, and vaccines. They target different approaches, including repurposing the already approved diagnosis and treatment options for similar CoVs. At present, over similar to 200 vaccine candidates are being developed against COVID-19. Future research may unravel the genetic variations or polymorphisms that dictate these differences in susceptibilities to the disease.

TI  - Rheumatologists' perspective on coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and potential therapeutic targets
T2  - CLINICAL RHEUMATOLOGY
AB  - The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a matter of global concern. Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19. Rheumatic manifestations such as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals. COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogren's syndrome. Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still's disease. In the absence of high-quality evidence in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate potential therapies. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease. Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Antiviral drugs like lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored. Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens. Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used. Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during infection episodes as per standard practices. Development of a vaccine may be the only effective long-term protection against this disease.

TI  - Update on therapeutic approaches and emerging therapies for SARS-CoV-2 virus
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in over 7,273,958 cases with almost over 413,372 deaths worldwide as per the WHO situational report 143 on COVID-19. There are no known treatment regimens with proven efficacy and vaccines thus far, posing an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs and vaccines for prevention and treatment. The urgency for its prevention and cure has resulted in an increased number of proposed treatment options. The high rate and volume of emerging clinical trials on therapies for COVID-19 need to be compared and evaluated to provide scientific evidence for effective medical options. Other emerging non-conventional drug discovery techniques such as bioinformatics and cheminformatics, structure-based drug design, network-based methods for prediction of drug-target interactions, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and phage technique could provide alternative routes to discovering potent Anti-SARS-CoV2 drugs. While drugs are being repurposed and discovered for COVID-19, novel drug delivery systems will be paramount for efficient delivery and avoidance of possible drug resistance. This review describes the proposed drug targets for therapy, and outcomes of clinical trials that have been reported. It also identifies the adopted treatment modalities that are showing promise, and those that have failed as drug candidates. It further highlights various emerging therapies and future strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 and delivery of Anti-SARS-CoV2 drugs.

TI  - The Points of Action of Drugs for Treating COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has reached a pandemic level. Very recently, I reported a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in severe COVID-19 as compared with non-severe COVID-19 by the meta-analysis. Considering that both diabetes and hypertension are risk factors for atherosclerosis, I further studied the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in COVID-19 and found a significantly higher prevalence of CVD in severe patients than in non-severe patients. I speculate that the preexisting vascular damage is associated with severity of COVID-19. A recent study showed that obese patients with COVID-19, despite their younger age, required more frequently assisted ventilation and access to intensive care units than normal weight patients. I thought that if the reason that COVID-19 is likely to become severe in obese people could be elucidated, the mechanism for aggravation of COVID-19 would be understood. As a result of considering a model of aggravation in obese people, I came up with the notion that pre-existing risk factors in obese people such as their vascular high-affinity for SARS-CoV-2, pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant state and endothelial dysfunction may be likely to induce the development of "systemic severe coagulopathic vasculitis (SSCV)" in obese people. I believe that SSCV may largely contribute to the development of severe COVID-19. Here, I will describe the points of action of drugs for treating COVID-19 by using the SSCV model.

TI  - Favipiravir Use in Kidney Transplant Recipients with COVID-19: A Single-Center Experience
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Objectives: Kidney transplant recipients are among the high-risk groups for severe COVID-19. To date, no specific antiviral agent has proved uniformly effective against SARS-CoV-2. Favipiravir, the recommended drug by the Turkish Ministry of Health, was uniformly supplied to all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test. The aim of our study was to retrospectively compare our kidney transplant recipients treated with favipiravir who developed COVID-19 infection versus those not treated with favipiravir during the clinical course of the disease, with a special emphasis on the occurrence of side effects and adverse events.
   Materials and Methods: We included 37 consecutive kidney transplant recipients with a median age of 46 years (62.2% women). Recipients included 8 with deceased donors and 29 with living related donors; median posttransplant survival was 8.0 years (IQR, 5.5-12.5 years).
   Results: Twenty-six patients (70.3%) received favipiravir, and 11 (29.7%) did not. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for baseline demographic characteristics and clinical and laboratory data, except that the favipiravir-treated patients were older and had a higher requirement of oxygen treatment. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups for the course and outcome of COVID-19 infection with regard to adverse side effects/events associated with favipiravir. Laboratory data at baseline, day 7, and day 30 were also comparable between the groups.
   Conclusions: Although the efficacy of favipiravir for treatment of COVID-19 infection remains controversial, favipiravir is safe for kidney transplant recipients.

TI  - Physicochemical Characteristics and In Vitro Toxicity/Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activity of Favipiravir Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs)
T2  - PHARMACEUTICALS
AB  - The rise of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases worldwide has driven the need to discover and develop novel therapeutics with superior efficacy to treat this disease. This study aims to develop an innovative aerosolized nano-formulation of favipiravir (FPV) as an anti-viral agent against coronavirus infection. The local delivery of FPV nanoparticles (NPs) via nebulization ensures that the drug can reach the site of infection, the lungs. Solid lipid NPs of favipiravir (FPV-SLNs) were formulated utilizing the hot-evaporation method. The physicochemical formulation properties were evaluated using dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The aerosol formulation performance was evaluated using an Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI) at a flow rate of 15 L/min. The FPV-SLN formulation's in vitro anti-viral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was also evaluated using the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen (hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-3/2020 isolate). The FPV-SLNs' morphology was defined utilizing transmission electron microscopy, showing an irregular shape. By means of FPV-SLNs' nebulization, a fine particle fraction of 60.2 +/- 1.7% was produced with 60.2 +/- 1.7%, and this finding suggests that FPV-SLNs were appropriate for inhalation drug delivery with a particle size of 537.6 +/- 55.72 nm. Importantly, the FPV-SLNs showed anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with CC50 and IC50 values of 449.6 and 29.9 mu g/mL, respectively. This study suggests that inhaled solid lipid NPs of favipiravir could potentially be used against coronavirus.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial of Combined Ivermectin and Zinc Sulfate versus Combined Hydroxychloroquine, Darunavir/Ritonavir, and Zinc Sulfate among Adult Patients with Asymptomatic or Mild Coronavirus-19 Infection
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Introduction: Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine (HQ), and darunavir/ritonavir are widely prescribed as an oral treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection despite their uncertainty of clinical benefit. The objective is to determine the safety and the efficacies of two treatment regimens against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We conducted an open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial to compare the efficacy between a 3-day course of once-daily high-dose oral ivermectin plus zinc sulfate (Group A) and a combination of HQ, darunavir/ritonavir, and zinc sulfate (HQ + antiretroviral, Group B) for 5 days in asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study period was between December 2020 and April 2021. Results: Overall, 113 patients were randomized and analyzed (57 patients in Group A and 56 patients in Group B). The median duration to achieve the virological outcome of either undetected or cycle threshold (Ct) for N gene of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction was 6 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3-6.7) versus 7 days (95% CI: 5.4-8.6) in Group A and Group B, respectively (P = 0.419) in the modified intention-to-treat population. All patients were discharged from hospital quarantine as planned. Two patients in Group A and one patient in Group B were considered clinically worsening and received 10 days of favipiravir treatment. There was no serious adverse event found in both groups. Conclusion: We demonstrated that both treatment regimens were safe, but both treatment regimens had no virological or clinical benefit. Based on this result and current data, there is no supporting evidence for the clinical benefit of ivermectin for coronavirus-19.

TI  - Potential inhibitors for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
T2  - BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - The lack of a vaccine or any effective treatment for the aggressive novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created a sense of urgency for the discovery of effective drugs. Several repurposing pharmaceutical candidates have been reported or envisaged to inhibit the emerging infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but their binding sites, binding affinities and inhibitory mechanisms are still unavailable. In this study, we use the ligand-protein docking program and molecular dynamic simulation to ab initio investigate the binding mechanism and inhibitory ability of seven clinically approved drugs (Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Ritonavir, Beclabuvir, Indinavir and Favipiravir) and a recently designed alpha-ketoamide inhibitor (13b) at the molecular level. The results suggest that Chloroquine has the strongest binding affinity with 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) among clinically approved drugs, indicating its effective inhibitory ability for SARS-CoV-2. However, the newly designed inhibitor 13b shows potentially improved inhibition efficiency with larger binding energy compared with Chloroquine. We further calculate the important binding site residues at the active site and demonstrate that the MET 165 and HIE 163 contribute the most for 13b, while the MET 165 and GLN 189 for Chloroquine, based on residual energy decomposition analysis. The proposed work offers a higher research priority for 13b to treat the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and provides theoretical basis for further design of effective drug molecules with stronger inhibition.

TI  - The Evaluation of Patients with Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia Who are Recieving Favipiravir Treatment
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION MICROBES AND ANTIMICROBIALS
AB  - Introduction: There is no known specific treatment for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Our retrospective study evaluates the effectiveness of steroid treatment and the factors affecting treatment in patients with severe Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia that received favipiravir treatment.
   Materials and Methods: This study included patients older than 18 years with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received favipiravir treatment in a training and research hospital between March 1 and May 31, 2020. It retrospectively evaluated respiratory rate >30/min and/or severe respiratory distress and oxygen saturation <90 and typical thoracic computerized tomography findings: Bilateral lobular, peripheral lesions, and the presence of ground-glass opacities were determined as the criteria for severe pneumonia. For 82 cases of SARS-CoV-2 polymerise chain reaction positive, age, gender, symptoms, comorbidities, steroid use, and mortality rates were examined.
   Results: Eighty-two patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosed with severe pneumonia were included in the study. Of these cases, 63% were males. The median patient age was 64 +/- 16.98 (21-97, minimum-maximum) years. The mortality in women was 23%, and the mortality in men was 30%. The correlation between gender and mortality was statistically significant (p=0.04). Advanced age, chronic renal failure, and confusion on hospital admission were associated with mortality (p=0.04, p=0.02, p=0.02, respectively). Methylprednisolone was given to 12 patients as an additional treatment. The mortality of the patients who received steroid treatment was significantly lower than those who did not (p=0.017). There was no bacterial infection in these 12 patients, who received steroid treatment and the procalcitonin level was not high.
   Conclusion: In confirmed COVID-19 patients without concomitant bacterial infections, steroid treatment can lower mortality and long-term morbidities. Similar to prospective randomized studies, our study showed that steroid use reduces mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI  - Role of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak all over the world has led the researchers to strive to develop drugs or vaccines to prevent or halt the progression of this ailment. To hasten the treatment process, repurposed drugs are being evaluated. Favipiravir is one such oral drug that was approved for new and reemerging pandemic influenza in Japan in 2014 and has shown potent in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. It has a wide therapeutic safety margin indicated by a wide CC50/EC50 ratio for a high dose. From the clinical studies in COVID-19, it has shown rapid viral clearance as compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) and superior recovery rate than umifenovir. Overall, favipiravir has shown promising results in clinical studies in China, Russia, and Japan, and more trials are underway in multiple countries, including USA, UK, and India. Recently, treatment guidelines from many countries and some states from India have included favipiravir in the treatment protocol. This review provides insights into the evidence-based evolving role of favipiravir in the management of COVID-19 infection with emphasis on benefits of initiating an early antiviral therapy with special focus on favipiravir, its pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, in vitro, clinical data, and inclusion in the treatment protocols of COVID-19.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Subgenomic RNA Kinetics in Longitudinal Clinical Samples
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background. Given the persistence of viral RNA in clinically recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) have been reported as potential molecular viability markers for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, few data are available on their longitudinal kinetics, compared with genomic RNA (gRNA), in clinical samples.
   Methods. We analyzed 536 samples from 205 patients with COVID-19 from placebo-controlled, outpatient trials of peginterferon Lambda-1a (Lambda; n = 177) and favipiravir (n = 359). Nasal swabs were collected at 3 time points in the Lambda (days 1, 4, and 6) and favipiravir (days 1, 5, and 10) trials. N-gene gRNA and sgRNA were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To investigate the decay kinetics in vitro, we measured gRNA and sgRNA in A549(ACE2+) cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, following treatment with remdesivir or dimethylsulfoxide control.
   Results. At 6 days in the Lambda trial and 10 days in the favipiravir trial, sgRNA remained detectable in 51.6% (32/62) and 49.5% (51/106) of the samples, respectively. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for gRNA and sgRNA were highly linearly correlated (marginal R-2 = 0.83), and the rate of increase did not differ significantly in the Lambda trial (1.36 cycles/d vs 1.36 cycles/d; P =.97) or the favipiravir trial (1.03 cycles/d vs 0.94 cycles/d; P =.26). From samples collected 15-21 days after symptom onset, sgRNA was detectable in 48.1% (40/83) of participants. In SARS-CoV-2-infected A549(ACE2+) cells treated with remdesivir, the rate of Ct increase did not differ between gRNA and sgRNA.
   Conclusions. In clinical samples and in vitro, sgRNA was highly correlated with gRNA and did not demonstrate different decay patterns to support its application as a viability marker.

TI  - Effectiveness of Antiviral and Immunomodulatory Agents in the Treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Review
T2  - CURRENT RESPIRATORY MEDICINE REVIEWS
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) posed a severe threat to global health. Therefore, new findings on effective treatment for symptomatic patients with COVID-19 are considered among emergency issues. This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of pharmacologic interventions in the management of patients with COVID-19. All the articles published in three electronic databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science, were searched from September 15 to September 30, 2020. Eventually, 24 papers published till September 30 remained to be included in this review. The effectiveness of immunomodulatory and antiviral agents in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 was assessed in this review. The obtained results of the current review rejected the potential of HCQ for the treatment of COVID; however, there was a clinical improvement in patients treated with ruxolitinib in comparison to that reported for the control group. Methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and calcifediol were suggested as beneficial treatments for patients with COVID-19. The potential efficacy of these antiviral drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is controversial; nevertheless, the triple combination of antiviral and immunomodulatory agents is effective in suppressing the shedding of SARS-CoV-2. There have been no supportive data on the superiority of favipiravir and LPV/r to standard care in the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, no difference was observed between favipiravir and arbidol for the treatment of these patients. There was an association between remdesivir treatment and a reduction of 5 days in clinical improvement among COVID-19 patients. It is required to carry out further RCTs with an in-depth research basis on COVID-19.

TI  - Repurposed Drugs, Molecular Vaccines, Immune-Modulators, and Nanotherapeutics to Treat and Prevent COVID-19 Associated with SARS-CoV-2, a Deadly Nanovector
T2  - ADVANCED THERAPEUTICS
AB  - The deadly pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has paralyzed the world. Although significant methodological advances have been made in the field of viral detection/diagnosis with 251 in vitro diagnostic tests receiving emergency use approval by the US-FDA, little progress has been made in identifying curative or preventive therapies. This review discusses the current trends and potential future approaches for developing COVID-19 therapeutics, including repurposed drugs, vaccine candidates, immune-modulators, convalescent plasma therapy, and antiviral nanoparticles/nanovaccines/combinatorial nanotherapeutics to surmount the pandemic viral strain. Many potent therapeutic candidates emerging via drug-repurposing could significantly reduce the cost and duration of anti-COVID-19 drug development. Gene/protein-based vaccine candidates that could elicit both humoral and cell-based immunity would be on the frontlines to prevent the disease. Many emerging nanotechnology-based interventions will be critical in the fight against the deadly virus by facilitating early detection and enabling target oriented multidrug therapeutics. The therapeutic candidates discussed in this article include remdesivir, dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, favilavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, antibody therapeutics like gimsilumab and TJM2, anti-viral nanoparticles, and nanoparticle-based DNA and mRNA vaccines.

TI  - Reactive arthritis after COVID-19 infection
T2  - RMD OPEN
AB  - Reactive arthritis (ReA) is typically preceded by sexually transmitted disease or gastrointestinal infection. An association has also been reported with bacterial and viral respiratory infections. Herein, we report the first case of ReA after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This male patient is in his 50s who was admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia. On the second day of admission, SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive from nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Despite starting standard dose of favipiravir, his respiratory condition deteriorated during hospitalisation. On the fourth hospital day, he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and was intubated. On day 11, he was successfully extubated, subsequently completing a 14-day course of favipiravir. On day 21, 1 day after starting physical therapy, he developed acute bilateral arthritis in his ankles, with mild enthesitis in his right Achilles tendon, without rash, conjunctivitis, or preceding diarrhoea or urethritis. Arthrocentesis of his left ankle revealed mild inflammatory fluid without monosodium urate or calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Culture of synovial fluid was negative. Plain X-rays of his ankles and feet showed no erosive changes or enthesophytes. Tests for syphilis, HIV, anti-streptolysin O (ASO), Mycoplasma, Chlamydia pneumoniae, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody and Human Leukocyte Antigen-B27 (HLA-B27) were negative. Gonococcal and Chlamydia trachomatis urine PCR were also negative. He was diagnosed with ReA. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)s and intra-articular corticosteroid injection resulted in moderate improvement.

TI  - Treatment Options for COVID-19: A Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background:The recent COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the globe has caused great concern worldwide. Due to the limited evidence available on the dynamics of the virus and effective treatment options available, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a huge impact in terms of morbidity and mortality. The economic impact is still to be assessed. Aims:The purpose of this article is to review the evidence for the multiple treatment options available, to consider the future of this global pandemic, and to identify some potential options that could revolutionize the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, this article underscores the sheer importance of repurposing some of the available antiviral and antimicrobial agents that have long been in use so as to have an effective and expeditious response to this widespread pandemic and the need to conduct a multicenter global randomized controlled trial to find an effective single antiviral agent or a cocktail of available antimicrobial agents. Method:We thoroughly searched and reviewed various case reports, retrospective analyses, andin vitrostudies published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar regarding the treatment options used for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 since its outbreak in an attempt to highlight treatments with the most promising results. Conclusion:We are currently facing one of the worst pandemics in history. Although SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a lower mortality rate than are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, its higher infectivity is making it a far more serious threat. Unfortunately, no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 or effective drug regimen for COVID-19 currently exists. Drug repurposing of available antiviral agents may provide a respite; moreover, a cocktail of antiviral agents may be helpful in treating this disease. Here, we have highlighted a few available antimicrobial agents that could be very effective in treating COVID-19; indeed, a number of trials are underway to detect and confirm the efficacy of these agents.

TI  - Effectiveness of Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Favipiravir for COVID-19 Treatment: A Systematic Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel strain that causes acute respiratory illnesses known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is limited information regarding the therapeutic management for this disease. Several studies have stated that antivirals drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir may potentially inhibit the virus from spreading to the host.
   Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the clinical effectiveness and safety of remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir on COVID-19.
   Methods: The PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to July 2021 to identify eligible experimental randomized controlled trials on remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19 patients. This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline.
   Results: From 158 references, 15 studies were included in the review. The results showed that remdesivir has some potential benefits for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, as seen from clinical improvements such as faster recovery time, less duration of hospitalization, and fewer respiratory side effects among COVID-19 patients. However, the impact of remdesivir in reducing mortality remains uncertain. Treatment with favipiravir has shown promising improvement in the clinical status of COVID-19 patients, although the results suggested no significant differences in some clinical parameters such as length of hospitalizations and clinical recovery. A combination of favipiravir with other supportive therapy showed more favorable outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients reported no significant clinical improvement compared to standard care with notable adverse effect reactions.
   Conclusion: This study provides an overview of the evidence-based role of remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in the management of COVID-19. A thorough assessment of the benefit-risk profile in COVID-19 patients is urgently needed. The current review was based on very limited available data; therefore, further well-designed clinical trials are required.

TI  - A Therapeutic Journey of Potential Drugs Against COVID-19
T2  - MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Coronavirus disease (CoVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) scrambles the world by infecting millions of peoples all over the globe. It has caused tremendous morbidity, mortality and greatly impacted the lives and economy worldwide as an outcome of mandatory quarantines or isolations. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Physicians and researchers throughout the world are working to understand the pathophysiology to expose the conceivable handling regimens and to determine the effective vaccines and/or therapeutic agents. Some of them re-purposed drugs for clinical trials which were primarily known to be effective against the RNA viruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. In the absence of a proven efficacy therapy, the current management use therapies based on antivirals, anti-inflammatory drugs, convalescent plasma, anti-parasitic agents in both oral and parenteral formulation, oxygen therapy, and heparin support. What is needed at this hour, however, is a definitive drug therapy or vaccine. Different countries are rushing to find this, and various trials are already underway. We aimed to summarize the potential therapeutic strategies as treatment options for COVID-19 that could be helpful to stop further spread of SARS-CoV-2 by affecting its structural components or modulation of immune response and discuss the leading drugs/vaccines, which are considered as potential agents for controlling this pandemic.

TI  - A review on the interaction of nucleoside analogues with SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB  - The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019, have highlighted the concerns about the lack of potential vaccines or antivirals approved for inhibition of CoVs infection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is almost preserved across different viral species can be a potential target for development of antiviral drugs, including nucleoside analogues (NA). However, ExoN proofreading activity of CoVs leads to their protection from several NAs. Therefore, potential platforms based on the development of efficient NAs with broad-spectrum efficacy against human CoVs should be explored. This study was then aimed to present an overview on the development of NAs-based drug repurposing for targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by computational analysis. Afterwards, the clinical development of some NAs including Favipiravir, Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Tenofovir, and Remdesivir as potential inhibitors of RdRp, were surveyed. Overall, exploring broad-spectrum NAs as promising inhibitors of RdRp may provide useful information about the identification of potential antiviral repurposed drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia in a patient undergoing pneumonectomy and pathology findings during the incubation period
T2  - SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical information about patients undergoing lung resection while infected with this virus and pathological information about early COVID-19 pneumonia are still scarce.
   CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old male patient underwent a right pneumonectomy for squamous cell lung carcinoma. Until the fourth postoperative day, the patient, who had minor radiological changes on chest x-ray, was asymptomatic. From this day, the COVID-19 test, which was performed after the appearance of symptoms such as fever and shortness of breath, lymphopenia and diffuse ground glass opacity in the left lung on computed tomography, was reported to be positive. The patient was given NIMV (non-invasive mechanical ventilation), and hydroxy-chloroquine, favipiravir and azithromycin in isolation intensive care, with the diagnosis of severe pneumonia. He was discharged on the 17th postoperative day with healing of the lung lesions. The pathology specimen of the patient, who was found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before the day of surgery, was examined retrospectively. Irregular and severe pneumocyte hyperplasia, interstitial thickening, oedema, pronounced protein exudates, diffuse enlargement of the alveolar walls, macrophage infiltration and fibroblastic proliferation, which is an indicator of early organisation, were detected.
   CONCLUSION: We believe that the clinical course and pathology findings obtained after right pneumonectomy in a patient with pre-symptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia will guide the diagnosis and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - US201 Study: A Phase 2, Randomized Proof-of-Concept Trial of Favipiravir for the Treatment of COVID-19
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background. Favipiravir is used to treat influenza, and studies demonstrate that it has antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
   Methods. We performed a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of favipiravir in hospitalized adult patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients were randomized to standard of care (SOC) or favipiravir treatment (1800 mg per os twice a day [b.i.d.] on day 1, followed by 1000 mg b.i.d. for 13 days). The primary end point was time to viral clearance on day 29.
   Results. Fifty patients were enrolled and stratified by disease severity (critical disease, severe disease, or mild to moderate disease). Nineteen patients were censored from the event of viral clearance based on being SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative at the study outset, being PCR-positive at day 29, or because of loss to follow-up. Data from the 31 remaining patients who achieved viral clearance show enhanced viral clearance in the favipiravir group compared with the SOC group by day 29, with 72% of the favipiravir group and 52% of the SOC group being evaluable for viral clearance through day 29. The median time to viral clearance was 16.0 days (90% CI, 12.0 to 29.0) in the favipiravir group and 30.0 days (90% CI, 12.0 to 31.0) in the SOC group. A post hoc analysis revealed an effect in the subgroup of patients who were neutralizing antibody-negative at randomization. Treatment-emergent adverse events were equally distributed between the groups.
   Conclusions. We demonstrate that favipiravir can be safely administered to hospitalized adults with COVID-19 and believe that further studies are warranted.

TI  - Traveling for heart transplantation and returning with COVID-19: a logistical, clinical, and pharmacotherapeutic challenge from the Middle East
T2  - DRUGS & THERAPY PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Heart transplantation (HT) has become a standard option for patients with end-stage heart failure (HF). However, the scarcity of donor availability remains a major hurdle for receiving this novel therapy, especially in the context of the rapidly spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) pandemic. We report the case of a patient in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with advanced HF who was glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient and had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, chronic kidney disease stage II, and hyperlipidemia. He was referred for HT abroad and was subsequently caught in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, the US state most affected by the crisis at the time. Despite limited experience with favipiravir, we judged it to be the most appropriate agent with this patient's complex history given the lower risk for QT prolongation, no need for renal-dose adjustment, and no reported drug-drug interactions. Given the limited clinical experience with this agent, particularly for our patient, we decided to adopt strategies to mitigate and monitor the potential for QT prolongation. We outline the logistical, clinical, and pharmacological challenges that the poly-morbid patient and our HT program in the Middle-East faced under those novel circumstances.

TI  - Prophetic Medicine-Nigella Sativa (Black Cumin Seeds) - Potential Herb for COVID-19?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACOPUNCTURE
AB  - Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). Currently, the management of patients with COVID-19 depends mainly on repurposed drugs which include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir, umifenovir, interferon-alpha, interferon-beta and others. In this review, the potential of Nigella sativa (black cumin seeds) to treat the patients with COVID-19 analyzed, as it has shown to possess antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, immunomodulatory, bronchodilatory, antihistaminic, antitussive, antipyretic and analgesic activities. Medfine/PubMed Central/PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Directory of open access journals (DOAJ) and reference lists were searched to identify articles associated with antiviral and other properties of N.sativa related to the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Various randomized controlled trials, pilot studies, case reports and in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that N.sativa has antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, bronchodilatory, antihistaminic, antitussive activities related to causative oraganism and signs and symptoms of COVID-19. N. sativa could be used as an adjuvant therapy along with repurposed conventional drugs to manage the patients with COVID-19.

T2  - CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB  - A pandemic disease, COVID-19, affecting over 253 million and 5.1 million deaths reported as on November 2021 from across the globe. The worst hit pandemic since a century. Scientists around the world are working towards the development of drugs for its treatment. Several existing antiviral medications have been tried for the same. Among these, Favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug originally developed to treat influenza, shows noted activity against an ample range of RNA viruses. It is an oral antiviral drug with good bioavailability found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19. This drug has acquired FDA manifestation for drug-resistant Influenza as it has confirmed its safety profile. There has been growing evidence that it helps in early viral clearance and speedy symptomatic relief against COVID-19. This review attempts to provide synthetic methods of favipiravir, mechanism of action and its importance in the treatment of COVID-19 and other viruses.

TI  - Japanese rapid/living recommendations on drug management for COVID-19: updated guidelines (July 2022)
T2  - ACUTE MEDICINE & SURGERY
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread worldwide since early 2020, and there are still no signs of resolution. The Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock (J-SSCG) 2020 Special Committee created the Japanese Rapid/Living recommendations on drug management for COVID-19 using the experience of creating the J-SSCG.
   Methods: The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to determine the certainty of the evidence and strength of recommendations. The first edition of this guideline was released on September 9, 2020, and this is the revised edition (version 5.0; released on July 15, 2022). Clinical questions (CQs) were set for the following 10 drugs: favipiravir (CQ1), remdesivir (CQ2), corticosteroids (CQ4), tocilizumab (CQ5), anticoagulants (CQ7), baricitinib (CQ8), casirivimab/imdevimab (CQ9-1), sotrovimab (CQ9-2), molnupiravir (CQ10), and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (CQ11).
   Recommendation: Favipiravir is not suggested for all patients with COVID-19 (GRADE 2C). Remdesivir is suggested for patients with mild COVID-19 who do not require oxygen, and patients with moderate COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (both GRADE 2B). Corticosteroids are recommended for moderate and severe COVID-19 (GRADE 1B, 1A). However, their administration is not recommended for mild COVID-19 (GRADE 1B). Tocilizumab is suggested for moderate and severe COVID-19 (GRADE 2B, 2C). Anticoagulant administration is recommended for moderate and severe COVID-19 (Good Practice Statement). Baricitinib is suggested for moderate and severe COVID-19 (both GRADE 2C). Casirivimab/imdevimab and sotrovimab are recommended for mild COVID-19 (both GRADE 2C). Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are recommended for mild COVID-19 (both GRADE 2C). SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains emerge occasionally, and each time, the treatment policy at clinics is forced to change drastically. We ask healthcare professionals in the field to refer to the recommendations in these guidelines and use these to keep up to date with COVID-19 epidemiological information.

TI  - beta-D-N-4-hydroxycytidine Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Through Lethal Mutagenesis But Is Also Mutagenic To Mammalian Cells
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Mutagenic ribonucleosides can act as broad-based antiviral agents. They are metabolized to the active ribonucleoside tri-phosphate form and concentrate in genomes of RNA viruses during viral replication. beta-D-N-4-hydroxycridine (NHC, initial metabolite of molnupiravir) is >100-fold more active than ribavirin or favipiravir against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with antiviral activity correlated to the level of mutagenesis in virion RNA. However, NHC also displays host mutational activity in an animal cell culture assay, consistent with RNA and DNA precursors sharing a common intermediate of a ribonucleoside diphosphate. These results indicate highly active mutagenic ribonucleosides may hold risk for the host.

TI  - Overcoming Culture Restriction for SARS-CoV-2 in Human Cells Facilitates the Screening of Compounds Inhibiting Viral Replication
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Efforts to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic include the screening of existing antiviral molecules that could be repurposed to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Although SARS-CoV-2 replicates and propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) often show decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits low viability in human cells in culture. Here, serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate (original-SARS2) in the human hepatoma cell clone Huh7.5 led to the selection of a variant (adapted-SARS2) with significantly improved infectivity in human liver (Huh7 and Huh7.5) and lung cancer (unmodified Calu-1 and A549) cells. The adapted virus exhibited mutations in the spike protein, including a 9-amino-acid deletion and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). E484D also emerged in Vero E6-cultured viruses that became viable in A549 cells. Original and adapted viruses were susceptible to scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) receptor blocking, and adapted-SARS2 exhibited significantly less dependence on ACE2. Both variants were similarly neutralized by COVID-19 convalescent-phase plasma, but adapted-SARS2 exhibited increased susceptibility to exogenous type I interferon. Remdesivir inhibited original- and adapted-SARS2 similarly, demonstrating the utility of the system for the screening of NUCs. Among the tested NUCs, only remdesivir, molnupiravir, and, to a limited extent, galidesivir showed antiviral effects across human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity. Analogously to the emergence of spike mutations in vivo, the spike protein is under intense adaptive selection pressure in cell culture. Our results indicate that the emergence of spike mutations will most likely not affect the activity of remdesivir.

TI  - Urticaria and Angioedema in a Patient Diagnosed with COVID-19: Case Report
T2  - FLORA INFEKSIYON HASTALIKLARI VE KLINIK MIKROBIYOLOJI DERGISI
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, which has affected the whole world, can cause clinical pictures ranging from mild cold symptoms to severe lower respiratory tract infections that can cause mortality. Recently, reports of dermatological findings associated with COVID-19 such as urticaria has been increasing. Here, a COVID-19 case presenting with urticaria and angioedema is described. A 26-year-old female patient, who was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive by polymerase chain reaction performed for being in contact, presented to our outpatient clinic with complaints of itchy, erythematous lesions on her body and swelling in the eyes and throat for four days. The patient received favipiravir treatment for 5 days and these complaints started 4 days after the treatment ended. History of food and other drug allergies, insect bites and chemicals were questioned in the differential diagnosis for etiology, however, no relationship was detected. Systemic corticosteroid and antihistamine treatment was initiated, and edema in the eyes completely regressed and urticaria plaques faded on the 3rd day of the treatment. Dermatological findings may occur simultaneously with the classic symptoms of the disease or before or after symptoms. Although the pathogenesis between dermatological findings and COVID-19 has not been fully elucidated, studies have suggested that viral infections and SARS-CoV-2 can be an etiological agent for chronic or acute urticaria. It is thought that some rashes may be causally related to the viral effect and others to the immune response. It is emphasized that there may be atypical findings such as urticaria/angioedema in order to diagnose COVID-19 disease early and prevent its spread and should be considered in differential diagnosis.

TI  - Chemoprophylaxis, diagnosis, treatments, and discharge management of COVID-19: An evidence-based clinical practice guideline (updated version)
T2  - MILITARY MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting more than seventeen million people around the world. Diagnosis and treatment guidelines for clinicians caring for patients are needed. In the early stage, we have issued "A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)"; now there are many direct evidences emerged and may change some of previous recommendations and it is ripe for develop an evidence-based guideline. We formed a working group of clinical experts and methodologists. The steering group members proposed 29 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 covering the following areas: chemoprophylaxis, diagnosis, treatments, and discharge management. We searched the literature for direct evidence on the management of COVID-19, and assessed its certainty generated recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of ungraded consensus-based statement. Finally, we issued 34 statements. Among them, 6 were strong recommendations for, 14 were weak recommendations for, 3 were weak recommendations against and 11 were ungraded consensus-based statement. They covered topics of chemoprophylaxis (including agents and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) agents), diagnosis (including clinical manifestations, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respiratory tract specimens, IgM and IgG antibody tests, chest computed tomography, chest x-ray, and CT features of asymptomatic infections), treatments (including lopinavir-ritonavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, interferon, remdesivir, combination of antiviral drugs, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, interleukin-6 inhibitors, interleukin-1 inhibitors, glucocorticoid, qingfei paidu decoction, lianhua qingwen granules/capsules, convalescent plasma, lung transplantation, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), and discharge management (including discharge criteria and management plan in patients whose RT-PCR retesting shows SARS-CoV-2 positive after discharge). We also created two figures of these recommendations for the implementation purpose. We hope these recommendations can help support healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients.

TI  - COVID-19 Infection: Targeting Possibilities for Treatment
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN THERAPEUTIC DRUG CARRIER SYSTEMS
AB  - The outbreak of novel coronavirus (nCoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has posed an international public health emergency worldwide and forced people to be confined in their homes. This virus is of high-risk category and is declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The worldwide researchers and various health professionals are working together to determine the best way to stop its spread or halt this virus's spread and circumvent this pandemic condition threatening millions of human lives. The absence of definitive treatment is possible to explore to reduce virus infection and enhance patient recovery. Along with off-label medicines, plasma therapy, vaccines, the researchers exploit the various plants/herbs and their constituents to effectively treat nCoV infection. The present study aimed to present brief and most informative salient features of the numerous facts regarding the SARS-CoV-2, including the structure, genomic sequence, recent mutation, targeting possibility, and various hurdles in research progress, and off-labeled drugs, convalescent plasma therapy, vaccine and plants/herbs for the treatment of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Results showed that off-labeled drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, antiviral drug (remdesivir, favipiravir), etc., give positive results and approved for use or approved for restricted use in some countries like India. Future research should focus on these possibilities that may allow the development of an effective treatment for COVID-19.

TI  - On M-polynomial and some topological indices of Favipiravir (T - 705) and Ribavirin
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISCRETE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES & CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is upsetting human well-being and the economy around the globe. Scientists have been trying some antiviral drugs to control the disease and transmission of the 2019-nCoV in vitro. Two of these compounds are Favipiravir (T-705) and Ribavirin. Topological index also known as connectivity index, is a molecular descriptor which is calculated based on the molecular graph of a chemical compound. Topological indices are used to predict different biological and physicochemical properties of chemical compounds. In this article, various significant topological degree-based indices and the M-polynomials are investigated for the Favipiravir(T-705) and Ribavirin. The results obtained may aid in the designing of new medicine for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and other diseases.

TI  - TREATMENT OF MYASTHENIA GRAVIS PATIENTS WITH COVID-19: REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
T2  - ACTA CLINICA CROATICA
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the late 2019 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a respiratory disease which could put myasthenia gravis (MG) patients at a greater risk of developing severe disease course, since infections and some drugs are a well-recognized trigger of symptom exacerbation in MG patients. Out of ten most commonly used past and present drugs used in COVID-19 treatment, two (quinolone derivatives and azithromycin) are known to worsen MG symptoms, whereas another two (tocilizumab and eculizumab) might have positive effect on MG symptoms. Colchicine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir seem to be safe to use, while data are insufficient for bamlanivimab, although it is also probably safe to use. Considering MG treatment options in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, acetylcholine esterase inhibitors are generally safe to use with some preliminary studies even demonstrating therapeutic properties in regard to COVID-19. Corticosteroids are in general safe to use, even recommended in specific circumstances, whereas other immunosuppressive medications (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate) are probably safe to use. The only exception is rituximab since the resulting B cell depletion can lead to more severe COVID-19 disease. Concerning plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulins, both can be used in COVID-19 while taking into consideration thromboembolic properties of the former and hemodynamic disturbances of the latter. As current data suggest, all known COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in MG patients.

TI  - COVID-19: Are Experimental Drugs a Cure or Cause?
T2  - CURRENT DRUG SAFETY
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus. It is characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has quickly influenced all over the world since it spreads easily. Common symptoms are fever, cough, difficulty in breathing and muscle aches. Despite the urgent need to find an effective antiviral treatment, already available agents are being used alone or in combination all over the world. At the beginning of the pandemic, death rates of infection caused by COVID-19 are high but "is COVID-19 responsible for all deaths?", or "are there any contributions of the frequently used drugs in this period to these deaths?" Surely herd immunity plays a major role and has contributed to the decline in mortality rates. Meanwhile, it is kept in mind that due to safety concerns, changes have also been made in the dosage and combined use of frequently used drugs.
   Objective: In this review, answers to two questions above and the safety of treatments, toxicities of agents involving chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopiravir/ritonavir, sarilumab, tocilizumab, siltuximab, corticosteroids and bromhexine which are the most frequently used in Turkey and all over the world will be summarized.
   Conclusion: Among these drugs, favipiravir seems the most promising drug due to more tolerable adverse effects. More clinical trials with large sample sizes are needed to find the most effective and safe drug for COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Pharmacophore modelling of vanillin derivatives, favipiravir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, monolaurin and tetrodotoxin as M-Pro inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
T2  - BMC RESEARCH NOTES
AB  - ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to use Ligand-based pharmacophore modelling approach for four established antiviral drugs, namely remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 inhibitors as training sets. In this study Twenty vanillin derivatives together with monolaurin and tetrodotoxin were used as test sets to evaluate as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The Structure-based pharmacophore modelling approach was also performed using 5RE6, 5REX and 5RFZ in order to analyse the binding site and ligand-protein complex interactions.ResultsThe pharmacophore modelling mode of 5RE6 displayed two Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA) and one Hydrophobic (HY) interaction. Besides, the pharmacophore model of 5REX showed two HBA and two HY interactions. Finally, the pharmacophore model of 5RFZ showed three HBA and one HY interaction. Based on ligand-based approach, 20 Schiff-based vanillin derivatives, showed strong M-Pro inhibition activity. This was due to their good alignment and common features to PDB-5RE6. Similarly, monolaurin and tetrodotoxin displayed some significant activity against SARS-CoV-2. From structure-based approach, vanillin derivatives (1) to (12) displayed some potent M-Pro inhibition against SARS-CoV-2. Favipiravir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also showed some significant M-Pro inhibition.

TI  - Advances in the possible treatment of COVID-19: A review
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The emergence of the global pandemic caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has put a challenge to identify or derive the therapeutics for its prevention and treatment. Despite the unprecedented advances in the modern medicinal system, currently, there are no proven effective therapies. However, rapid research on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology help unveiling some new targets for potential drug therapies. Many drugs have been screened, and even their clinical trials are going on at an exceptional pace. Amongst these RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors (favipiravir and remdesivir) and steroids especially dexamethasone showed promising effects. The biological agents like tocilizumab, interferon, and convalescent plasma prove to be beneficial in viral clearance. Moreover, many immunomodulatory and viral S protein targeting vaccines have their ongoing clinical trials. The establishment of various in vitro and in vivo models for preclinical studies can additionally help the current research. The volume and the pace of the clinical trials launched to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various agents against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reflect the need for high-quality evidence for various therapies to be practiced by clinicians. This study aims to sum up all the current advances in the global medicinal system against the COVID-19.

TI  - "Bucket brigade'' using lysine residues in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2
T2  - BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB  - The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a promising drug target for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) because it plays the most important role in the replication of the RNA genome. Nucleotide analogs such as remdesivir and favipiravir are thought to interfere with the RNA replication by RdRp. More specifically, they are expected to compete with nucleoside triphosphates, such as ATP. However, the process in which these drug molecules and nucleoside triphosphates are taken up by RdRp remains unknown. In this study, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to clarify the recognition mechanism of RdRp for these drug molecules and ATP that were at a distance. The ligand recognition ability of RdRp decreased in the order of remdesivir, favipiravir, and ATP. We also identified six recognition paths. Three of them were commonly found in all ligands, and the remaining three paths were ligand-dependent ones. In the common two paths, it was observed that the multiple lysine residues of RdRp carried the ligands to the binding site like a "bucket brigade.'' In the remaining common path, the ligands directly reached the binding site. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the efficient ligand recognition by RdRp at the atomic level.

TI  - Two antioxidant 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles (CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020): successful repurposing against COVID-19 as the first potent multitarget anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs
T2  - NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB  - Repurposing of known drugs and compounds as anticoronavirus disease 2019 (anti-COVID-19) agents through biological reevaluation of their activities, especially the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) activities, is a new viable trend in drug discovery for the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Comprehensive inhibition of the enzymes and proteins of coronavirus and coronavirus 2 (i.e., multitarget inhibition) can be considered one of the most promising strategies for the development of highly potent remedies for COVID-19. However, almost all the reported inhibitors of the different life cycle stages of SARS-CoV-2 lack extreme potency against the major and fateful SARS-CoV-2 enzymes (e.g., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase "RdRp", papain-like protease "PLpro", and main protease "Mpro"). Herein, two antioxidant polyphenolic 1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds previously synthesized by me were repurposed and introduced, 1,2,3-tris[5-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]propan-2-ol (named CoViTris2020) and 5-[5-(7-chloro-4-hydroxyquinolin-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]benzene-1,2,3-triol (named ChloViD2020), as the first multitarget SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors with higher potencies than other drugs reported to date (about 65, 171, and 303.5 times for CoViTris2020 and 20, 52.5, and 93 times for ChloViD2020 compared to those of remdesivir, ivermectin, and favipiravir, respectively). These two unique 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives were computationally studied (through molecular docking in almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins and one human protein) and biologically evaluated (through one of the most credible in vitro anti-COVID-19 assays) for their anti-COVID-19 activities. The results of the computational docking showed that CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 exhibited very high inhibitory binding affinities with most of the docked SARS-CoV-2/human proteins (e.g., they exhibited low binding energies of -12.00 and -9.60 kcal mol(-1), respectively, with RdRp-RNA). Interestingly, the results of the biological assay showed that CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 exhibited very high and extremely significant anti-COVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 = 0.31 and 1.01 mu M, respectively). Additionally, they may also be very promising lead compounds for the design and synthesis of new anti-COVID-19 agents (through structural modifications and further computational studies). Therefore, further investigations for the development of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as anti-COVID-19 drugs through in vivo biological evaluations and clinical trials are necessary. In brief, the development of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as the first two members of the new and promising class of anti-COVID-19 polyphenolic 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives will result in a therapeutic revolution for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its accompanying COVID-19.

TI  - Combination of natural antivirals and potent immune invigorators: A natural remedy to combat COVID-19
T2  - PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH
AB  - The flare-up in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread expeditiously worldwide has become a health challenge globally. The rapid transmission, absence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, and inexistence of vaccine are further exacerbating the situation. Several drugs, including chloroquine, remdesivir, and favipiravir, are presently undergoing clinical investigation to further scrutinize their effectiveness and validity in the management of COVID-19. Natural products (NPs) in general, and plants constituents specifically, are unique sources for various effective and novel drugs. Immunostimulants, including vitamins, iron, zinc, chrysin, caffeic acid, and gallic acid, act as potent weapons against COVID-19 by reinvigorating the defensive mechanisms of the immune system. Immunity boosters prevent COVID-19 by stimulating the proliferation of T-cells, B-cells, and neutrophils, neutralizing the free radicals, inhibiting the immunosuppressive agents, and promoting cytokine production. Presently, antiviral therapy includes several lead compounds, such as baicalin, glycyrrhizin, theaflavin, and herbacetin, all of which seem to act against SARS-CoV-2 via particular targets, such as blocking virus entry, attachment to host cell receptor, inhibiting viral replication, and assembly and release.

TI  - Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease: A Computational Drug Repurposing Study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background and Aims. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) induced Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has currently become pandemic worldwide. Though drugs like remdesivir, favipiravir, and dexamethasone found beneficial for COVID-19 management, they have limitations clinically, and vaccine development takes a long time. The researchers have reported key proteins which could act as druggable targets. Among them, the major protease Mpro is first published, plays a prominent role in viral replication and an attractive drug-target for drug discovery. Hence, to target Mpro and inhibit it, we accomplished the virtual screening of US-FDA approved drugs using well-known drug repurposing approach by computer-aided tools.
   Methods. The protein Mpro, PDB-ID 6LU7 was imported to Maestro graphical user inter phase of Schroeurodinger software. The US-FDA approved drug structures are imported from DrugBank and docked after preliminary protein and ligand preparation. The drugs are shortlisted based on the docking scores in the Standard Precision method (SP-docking) and then based on the type of molecular interactions they are studied for molecular dynamics simulations.
   Results. The docking and molecular interactions studies, five drugs emerged as potential hits by forming hydrophilic, hydrophobic, electrostatic interactions. The drugs such as arbutin, terbutaline, barnidipine, tipiracil and aprepitant identified as potential hits. Among the drugs, tipiracil and aprepitant interacted with the Mpro consistently, and they turned out to be most promising.
   Conclusions. This study shows the possible exploration for drug repurposing using computer-aided docking tools and the potential roles of tipiracil and aprepitant, which can be explored further in the treatment of COVID-19. (C) 2020 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Novel Drugs Targeting the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Machinery
T2  - CURRENT TOPICS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Like other human pathogenic viruses, coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 employs sophisticated macromolecular machines for viral host cell entry, genome replication and protein processing. Such machinery encompasses SARS-CoV-2 envelope spike (S) glycoprotein required for host cell entry by binding to the ACE2 receptor, viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 3-chymotrypsin-like main protease (3Clpro/Mpro). Under the pressure of the accelerating COVID-19 pandemic caused by the out-break of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in December 2019, novel and repurposed drugs were recently designed and identified for targeting the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction machinery, with the aim to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and morbidity and mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - The Molecular Docking Study of Potential Drug Candidates Showing Anti-COVID-19 Activity by Exploring of Therapeutic Targets of SARS-CoV-2
T2  - EURASIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND ONCOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: The novel human coronavirus designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. This virus spread rapidly around the globe, causing the respiratory illness called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In view of the multiple threats and disorder posed by the pandemic, scientists around the world have been racing to understand SARS-CoV-2 and investigate the pathophysiology of this disease to find potential treatments and effective therapeutic drug candidates.
   Methods: The virtual interaction of the COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) in complex with the inhibitor N3 (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 6LU7) with antiviral and antimalarial drugs was measured, as well as that of the SARS spike glycoprotein-human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) complex (PDB ID: 6CS2) with antimalarial drugs currently on the market using the AutoDock Vina suite (O. Trott, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA).
   Results: The binding energy result obtained from the docking of 6LU7 with ligands of oseltamivir, ritonavir, remdesivir, ribavirin, favipiravir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine was found to be -4.7, -7.3, -6.5, -5.6, -5.4, -5.1, -5.3 kcal/mol, respectively. The binding energy from the docking of 6CS2 with ligands of chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine was -7.1 and -6.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The docking results suggested drug molecules of oseltamivir, ritonavir, remdesivir, ribavirin, and favipiravir had a greater capability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 since they demonstrated high affinity interactions with the COVID-19 Mpro in complex with the N3 inhibitor. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also showed prominent binding interaction with the SARS spike glycoprotein-human ACE2 complex.
   Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that these drugs are promising candidates for antiviral treatment with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain.

TI  - Structural Basis of SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase Inhibition by Favipiravir
T2  - INNOVATION
AB  - The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has developed into an unprecedented global pandemic. Nucleoside analogs, such as Remdesivir and Favipiravir, can serve as the first-line broad-spectrum antiviral drugs by targeting the viral polymerases. However, the underlying mechanisms for the antiviral efficacies of these drugs are far from well understood. Here, we reveal that Favipiravir, as a pyrazine derivative, could be incorporated into the viral RNA products by mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides. This drug thus inhibits viral replication mainly by inducing mutations in progeny RNAs, different from Remdesivir or other RNA-terminating nucleoside analogs that impair the elongation of RNA products. We further determined the cryo-EM-structure of Favipiravir bound to the replicating polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-catalytic state. This structure provides a missing snapshot for visualizing the catalysis dynamics of coronavirus polymerase, and reveals an unexpected base-pairing pattern between Favipiravir and pyrimidine residues that may explain its capacity for mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides. These findings shed light on the mechanism of coronavirus polymerase catalysis and provide a rational basis for developing antiviral drugs to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

In this study, we developed a robust in vitro nonradioactive primer extension assay to quantitatively evaluate the efficiency of incorporation of nucleotide analogs by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Our results show that many nucleotide analogs can be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and that the incorporation of some of them leads to chain termination. The discrimination values of nucleotide analogs over those of natural nucleotides were measured to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In agreement with the data published in the literature, we found that the incorporation efficiency of remdesivir-TP is higher than that of ATP and incorporation of remdesivir-TP caused delayed chain termination, which can be overcome by higher concentrations of the next nucleotide to be incorporated. Our data also showed that the delayed chain termination pattern caused by remdesivir-TP incorporation is different for different template sequences. Multiple incorporations of remdesivir-TP caused chain termination under our assay conditions. Incorporation of sofosbuvir-TP is very low, suggesting that sofosbuvir may not be very effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a comparison, 2'-C-methyl-GTP can be incorporated into RNA efficiently, and the derivative of 2'-C-methyl-GTP may have therapeutic application in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. This report provides a simple screening method that should be useful for evaluating nucleotide-based drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and for studying the mechanism of action of selected nucleotide analogs.

TI  - Phytochemicals of Rhus spp. as Potential Inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease: Molecular Docking and Drug-Likeness Study
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Background. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated in China and spread to cover the entire world with an ongoing pandemic. The magnitude of the situation and the fast spread of the new and deadly virus, as well as the lack of specific treatment, led to a focus on research to discover new therapeutic agents. Aim. In this study, we explore the potential inhibitory effects of some active polyphenolic constituents of Rhus spp. (sumac) against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme (M-pro; 6LU7). Methods. 26 active polyphenolic compounds of Rhus spp. were studied for their antiviral activity by molecular docking, drug likeness, and synthetic accessibility score (SAS) as inhibitors against the SA RS-CoV-2 M-pro. Results. The results show that all tested compounds of sumac provided good interaction with the main active site of SARS-CoV-2 M-pro, with better, lower molecular docking energy (kcal/mol) compared to the well-known drugs chloroquine and favipiravir (Avigan). Only six active polyphenolic compounds of Rhus spp. (sumac), methyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate, (Z)-1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxyprop-2-en-1-one, (Z)-2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)-6-hydroxybenzofuran-3(2H)-one, 3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chroman-4-one, 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyI)-3,5-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-4H-chroman-4-one, and 3,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chroman-4-one, were proposed by drug likeness, solubility in water, and SAS analysis as potential inhibitors of M-pro that may be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion. Six phenolic compounds of Rhus spp. are proposed for synthesis as potential inhibitors against M-pro and have potential for the treatment of COVID-19. These results encourage further in vitro and in vivo investigations of the proposed ligands and research on the preventive use of Rhus spp. against SA RS-CoV-2.

TI  - Efficacy of favipiravir in adults with mild COVID-19: a randomized, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled clinical trial
T2  - CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - Objective: To evaluate whether favipiravir reduces the time to viral clearance as documented by negative RT-PCR results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in mild cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared to placebo.
   Methods: In this randomized, double-blinded, multicentre, and placebo-controlled trial, adults with PCR-confirmed mild COVID-19 were recruited in an outpatient setting at seven medical facilities across Saudi Arabia. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either favipiravir 1800 mg by mouth twice daily on day 1 followed by 800 mg twice daily (n = 112) or a matching placebo (n = 119) for a total of 5 to 7 days. The primary outcome was the effect of favipiravir on reducing the time to viral clearance (by PCR test) within 15 days of starting the treatment compared to the placebo group. The trial included the following secondary outcomes: symptom resolution, hospitalization, intensive care unit admissions, adverse events, and 28-day mortality.
   Results: Two hundred thirty-one patients were randomized and began the study (median age, 37 years; interquartile range (IQR): 32-44 years; 155 [67%] male), and 112 (48.5%) were assigned to the treatment group and 119 (51.5%) into the placebo group. The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrolment because of futility at the interim analysis. The median time to viral clearance was 10 days (IQR: 6-12 days) in the favipiravir group and 8 days (IQR: 6-12 days) in the placebo group, with a hazard ratio of 0.87 for the favipiravir group (95% CI 0.571-1.326; p = 0.51). The median time to clinical recovery was 7 days (IQR: 4-11 days) in the favipiravir group and 7 days (IQR: 5-10 days) in the placebo group. There was no difference between the two groups in the secondary outcome of hospital admission. There were no drug-related severe adverse events.
   Conclusion: In this clinical trial, favipiravir therapy in mild COVID-19 patients did not reduce the time to viral clearance within 15 days of starting the treatment. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

TI  - Interaction between favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine and their combined drug assessment: in silico investigations
T2  - CHEMICAL PAPERS
AB  - Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and favipiravir (FPV) are known to be effective antivirals, and there are reports about their use to fight the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) despite that these are not conclusive. The use of combined drugs is common in drug discovery, and thus, we investigated HCQ and FPV as a combined drug. The density functional theory method was used for the optimization of geometries, spectroscopic analysis and calculation of reactivity parameters. The quantum theory of atoms in molecules was applied to explain the nature of the hydrogen bonds and confirm the higher stability of the combined drug. We also evaluated the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) parameters to assess their drug actions jointly using SwissADME. The preliminary findings of our theoretical study are promising for further investigations of more potent and selective antiviral drugs.

TI  - Serum cytokine levels of COVID-19 patients after 7 days of treatment with Favipiravir or Kaletra
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected 86,4 M patients and resulted in 1,86 M deaths worldwide. Severe COVID-19 patients have elevated blood levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1I3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, IL-8 and interferon (IFN)gamma.
   Objective: To investigate the effect of antiviral treatment serum cytokines in severe COVID-19 patients.
   Methods: Blood was obtained from 29 patients (aged 32-79 yr) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 upon admission and 7 days after antiviral (Favipiravir or Lopinavir/Ritonavir) treatment. Patients also received standard supportive treatment in this retrospective observational study. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated to investigate lung manifestations of COVID-19. Serum was also obtained and cytokines levels were evaluated. 19 age-and gender-matched healthy controls were studied. Results: Anti-viral therapy significantly reduced CT scan scores and the elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In contrast, serum levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IFN gamma were elevated at baseline in COVID-19 subjects compared to healthy subjects with IL-6 (p = 0.006) and IL-8 (p = 0.011) levels being further elevated after antiviral therapy. IL-1I3 (p = 0.01) and TNF alpha (p = 0.069) levels were also enhanced after treatment but baseline levels were similar to those of healthy controls. These changes occurred irrespective of whether patients were admitted to the intensive care unit.
   Conclusion: Antiviral treatments did not suppress the inflammatory phase of COVID-19 after 7 days treatment although CT, CRP and LDH suggest a decline in lung inflammation. There was limited evidence for a viral mediated cytokine storm in these COVID-19 subjects.

TI  - New Pyrazine Conjugates: Synthesis, Computational Studies, and Antiviral Properties against SARS-CoV-2
T2  - CHEMMEDCHEM
AB  - Currently, limited therapeutic options are available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have developed a set of pyrazine-based small molecules. A series of pyrazine conjugates was synthesized by microwave-assisted click chemistry and benzotriazole chemistry. All the synthesized conjugates were screened against the SAR-CoV-2 virus and their cytotoxicity was determined. Computational studies were carried out to validate the biological data. Some of the pyrazine-triazole conjugates (5 d-g) and (S)-N-(1-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-2-phenylethyl)pyrazine-2-carboxamide 12 i show significant potency against SARS-CoV-2 among the synthesized conjugates. The selectivity index (SI) of potent conjugates indicates significant efficacy compared to the reference drug (Favipiravir).

TI  - The Assessment of the Efficacy and Safety of Favipiravir for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Multicenter Non-randomized, Uncontrolled Single-arm Prospective Study
T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective Among treatment options for coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), well-studied oral medications are limited. We conducted a multicenter non-randomized, uncontrolled single-arm prospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for patients with COVID-19.Methods One hundred participants were sequentially recruited to 2 cohorts: cohort 1 (Day 1: 1,600 mg/day, Day 2 to 14: 600 mg/day, n=50) and cohort 2 (Day 1: 1,800 mg/day, Day 2 to 14: 800 mg/day, n=50). The efficacy endpoint was the negative conversion rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the odds ratio (OR) of cohort 2 to cohort 1 for negative conversion on Day 10 was cal-culated. Characteristics of all participants and profiles of adverse events (AEs) were collected and analyzed.Results The mean age of participants was 62.8 +/- 17.6 years old. Thirty-four patients (34.0%) experienced worsening pneumonia, 7 (7.0%) were intubated, and 4 (4.0%) died during the observation period. Cohort 2 showed a higher negative conversion rate than cohort 1 [adjusted OR 3.32 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17 to 9.38), p=0.024], and this association was maintained after adjusting for the age, sex, body mass in-dex, and baseline C-reactive protein level. Regarding adverse events, hyperuricemia was most frequently ob-served followed by an elevation of the liver enzyme levels (all-grade: 49.0%, Grade >= 3: 12.0%), and cohort 2 tended to have a higher incidence than cohort 1. However, no remarkable association of adverse events was observed between patients <65 and >= 65 years old.Conclusion The antiviral efficacy of favipiravir was difficult to interpret due to the limitation of the study design. However, no remarkable issues with safety or tolerability associated with favipiravir were observed, even in elderly patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Virtual Screening and Quantum Chemistry Analysis for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Using the ChEMBL Database: Reproduction of the Remdesivir-RTP and Favipiravir-RTP Binding Modes Obtained from Cryo-EM Experiments with High Binding Affinity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the pathogenic cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is a potential target for the treatment of COVID-19. An RdRp complex:dsRNA structure suitable for docking simulations was prepared using a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure (PDB ID: 7AAP; resolution, 2.60 angstrom) that was reported recently. Structural refinement was performed using energy calculations. Structure-based virtual screening was performed using the ChEMBL database. Through 1,838,257 screenings, 249 drugs (37 approved, 93 clinical, and 119 preclinical drugs) were predicted to exhibit a high binding affinity for the RdRp complex:dsRNA. Nine nucleoside triphosphate analogs with anti-viral activity were included among these hit drugs, and among them, remdesivir-ribonucleoside triphosphate and favipiravir-ribonucleoside triphosphate adopted a similar docking mode as that observed in the cryo-EM structure. Additional docking simulations for the predicted compounds with high binding affinity for the RdRp complex:dsRNA suggested that 184 bioactive compounds could be anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates. The hit bioactive compounds mainly consisted of a typical noncovalent major groove binder for dsRNA. Three-layer ONIOM (MP2/6-31G:AM1:AMBER) geometry optimization calculations and frequency analyses (MP2/6-31G:AMBER) were performed to estimate the binding free energy of a representative bioactive compound obtained from the docking simulation, and the fragment molecular orbital calculation at the MP2/6-31G level of theory was subsequently performed for analyzing the detailed interactions. The procedure used in this study represents a possible strategy for discovering anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs from drug libraries that could significantly shorten the clinical development period for drug repositioning.

TI  - A rare case of absolute thrombocytopaenia in a COVID-19 patient: Case report
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
AB  - Introduction: Thrombocytopaenia, one of the most common haematological disorders worldwide, is characterised by platelet counts <150,000/mm(3). Patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were found to commonly exhibit haematological abnormalities, often with mild forms of thrombocytopaenia. Absolute thrombocytopaenia tends to be rare among these patients and is believed to be secondary to immune-induced thrombocytopaenia.
   Case presentation: A 53-y-old man presented with fever and generalised body ache that persisted for a few days. His polymerase chain reaction test was positive for COVID-19, for which he was treated with acetaminophen, levofloxacin, and favipiravir. On the third day of treatment, he noticed bruising and bleeding, mainly in the oral cavity, with clot formation. A complete blood picture (CBP) revealed severe thrombocytopaenia with an almost-zero count. Prednisone 1 mg/kg/d and frequent doses of intravenous platelet transfusion were administered as rescue therapy to prevent fatal bleeding. The patient was able to recover.
   Clinical discussion: Immune thrombocytopaenia should be considered in patients presenting with bleeding tendencies after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Serial CBP is recommended for vulnerable patients, especially during the second and third weeks of hospitalisation, for the early detection and prevention of life-threatening COVID-19 complications.
   Conclusions: Absolute thrombocytopaenia is a rare condition. Such a condition should be considered in patients presenting with bleeding tendencies with severe Covid-19 infection. With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, patients' lives can be saved.

TI  - Early favipiravir treatment was associated with early defervescence in non-severe COVID-19 patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Introduction: The antiviral drug favipiravir has been shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we investigated the clinical benefits and initiation of favipiravir treatment in patients with non-severe coronavirus-disease2019 (COVID-19).
   Methods: This study was a single-center retrospective cohort study. Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn to calculate the area under the curve, and the optimal cut-off values for the time to initiate favipiravir treatment were calculated to predict defervescence within seven days. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify potential influencing factors of defervescence. This was defined as a body temperature of less than 37 degrees C for at least 2 days.
   Results: Data from 41 patients were used for the efficacy assessment. The days from the onset of fever to defervescence showed a positive correlation with the duration from the onset of fever to initiation of favipiravir treatment (r = 0.548, P < 0.001). The optimal cut-off value was the administration of favipiravir on day 4. Patients were assigned to two groups based on the optimal cut-off value from onset to initiation of favipiravir treatment: early treatment group (within 4-days) and late treatment group (more than 4-days). In the multivariate analysis, when adjusted for age, sex, and days from onset to initiation of favipiravir treatment, the significant factors were male sex and days of initiation of the favipiravir treatment.
   Conclusions: We recommend that if favipiravir is to be used for treatment, it should be initiated as early as possible. (C) 2021 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Association between chronic ACE inhibitor exposure and decreased odds of severe disease in patients with COVID-19
T2  - ANATOLIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) inhibitors may increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is the receptor for SARSCoV-2 Spike protein. The consequences of using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study aiming to identify the odds of severe disease (defined as either hospitalization of >= 14 days, admission to the intensive care unit, or death) associated with exposure to ACEi or ARB was conducted. Adult patients (age >= 18 years) with COVID-19 admitted to the Istanbul Faculty of Medicine Corona Center between March 9 and May 11, 2020, were included. Chronic users of ACEi, ARB, or other antihypertensive drugs were matched according to age, sex, sick days before hospitalization, comorbidities, smoking, number of antihypertensive regimens, doxazosin use, furosemide use, and serum creatinine level. Odds ratios (OR) of having severe disease were calculated.
   Results: In total, 611 patients were admitted with COVID-19, confirmed by either reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or computed tomography (CT). There were 363 males, and the age ranged from 18 to 98 years, with an average age of 57 +/- 15 years. Of these, 165 participants had severe disease (53 deaths, case fatality rate: 8.7%). Among those with hypertension (n=249), ARB exposure was compatible with decreased odds (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.27-1.36, p=0.31) of severe disease though not statistically significant, while ACEi exposure significantly reduced the risk of severe disease (OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.15-0.87, p=0.03). ACEi exposure was associated with milder infiltrations seen on baseline CT, lower C-reactive protein and ferritin, higher monocytes, shorter hospitalization, and less requirement for specific empirical treatments (favipiravir and meropenem).
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that exposure to ACEi drugs may have favorable effects in the context of COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI  - Guidance on the special care of liver or kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID-19
T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with the novel, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), transplant medicine also had to face a new, hitherto unknown challenge. To be prepared for any possibility, we consider it important to summarize the current knowledge regarding COVID-19 of liver and kidney transplant patients. Very early reports from Spanish and French registry recorded fatality rates of 18.6% and 13%, respectively, in renal patients which suggests a moderately worse outcome compared to the general population. In patients with positive PCR test but not showing clinical signs, the reduction of immunosuppression is not advised. In the case of gastrointestinal or respiratory signs with fever, the discontinuation of mycophenolate or mTOR in-hibitors is recommended with decrease of the trough levels of calcineurin inhibitors to the lowest effective limit. Stop (kidney transplanted patients) or decrease (liver transplanted patients) immunosuppression and maintain corticosteroids when pulmonal injury develops and consider anti-IL1 and anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody use when hyperinflammatory syndrome is evolving. No proven effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 exists currently. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir should be avoided because of the severe drug interaction with calcineurin inhibitors. The efficacy and tolerability of hidroxychloroquin remains to be also questionable; enroll patients into clinical trial with remdesivir or favipiravir if available. COVID-19 is characterized by virus-induced endothelial dysfunction, procoagulant state and renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system imbalance. Early thromboprofilaxis combination with low-molecular-weight heparin and low-dose aspirin is strongly recommended with the maintenance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin-II-receptor blocker (ARB) therapy when they were prescribed earlier.

TI  - Antiviral efficacy of favipiravir against Zika and SARS-CoV-2 viruses in non-human primates
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Repurposed antiviral drugs present as a valuable resource in the defence during outbreaks, with rigorous evaluation in large animal models keys for translation to clinical implementation. Here, the authors explore the antiviral activity of favipiravir against Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques, in order to support future clinical investigations into this RNA polymerase inhibitor.
   The COVID-19 pandemic has exemplified that rigorous evaluation in large animal models is key for translation from promising in vitro results to successful clinical implementation. Among the drugs that have been largely tested in clinical trials but failed so far to bring clear evidence of clinical efficacy is favipiravir, a nucleoside analogue with large spectrum activity against several RNA viruses in vitro and in small animal models. Here, we evaluate the antiviral activity of favipiravir against Zika or SARS-CoV-2 virus in cynomolgus macaques. In both models, high doses of favipiravir are initiated before infection and viral kinetics are evaluated during 7 to 15 days after infection. Favipiravir leads to a statistically significant reduction in plasma Zika viral load compared to untreated animals. However, favipiravir has no effects on SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics, and 4 treated animals have to be euthanized due to rapid clinical deterioration, suggesting a potential role of favipiravir in disease worsening in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. To summarize, favipiravir has an antiviral activity against Zika virus but not against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the cynomolgus macaque model. Our results support the clinical evaluation of favipiravir against Zika virus but they advocate against its use against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - A case of COVID-19 pneumonia successfully treated with favipiravir (Avigan) in which serum SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by LAMP method was clinically useful
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - A 49-year-old Japanese male was managed by mechanical ventilation due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Favipiravir as an antiviral therapy, and anti-inflammatory treatment were administered. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in serum by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method on Day 9; favipiravir treatment was continued. On Day 13, negative serum RNA was confirmed, followed by mechanical ventilation was removed. On Day 23, LAMP negative was confirmed in nasopharynx, after that the patient discharged on Day 27. We could treat successfully for severe COVID-19 pneumonia based on the LAMP method. We consider this method will be useful in COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Clinical and Laboratory Evaluation of Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19 Receiving Favipiravir-based Treatment
T2  - BEZMIALEM SCIENCE
AB  - Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS COV-2); can lead to severe respiratory failure. In this study, factors affecting mortality in Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients who were hospitalized with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin and favipiravir treatments were investigated.
   Methods: Between March 10 and May 10, 2020, COVID-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive treatment naive 683 patients were screened retrospectively. Five hundred four patients were followed without treatment or with HCQ treatment. Out of 179 patients, 137 were hospitalized and 42 were directly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Oxygen saturation of these patients is <90%, follow-up (>30/min) and HCQ, azithromycin, favipiravir were started. 35 of 137 patients were transferred to ICU. Mechanical ventilation was provided to 69 (89%) of 77 patients in the ICU. 19 (24%) patients received tosilizumab and 13 (17%) patients received immune plasma. It was divided into two as healing and exitus. Demographic features, comorbid diseases, secondary bacterial infections and acute organ damage were recorded.
   Results: Two hundred of the patients were male and their average age was 60.9 +/- 16.4 years. HT and diabetes mellitus (DM) were the most common comorbid disease. Acute liver injury was most common. 54 patients became exitus. Exitus group has higher mean age, chronic heart disease (CHD), DM, CRF, acute cardiac damage and secondary bacterial infection are more statistically significant (p<0.05). Exitus status DM 2.17, COPD 2.18, asthma 3.01, CHD 2.4, CRF 8.3, malignancy 1.6, acute cardiac damage 12.9, secondary bacterial infection development 3.63 times mortality increase statistically significant (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: In patients receiving treatment based on Favipiravir; advanced age, DM, CHD, CKD, troponin-I elevation and secondary bacterial infections are associated with mortality. CRF and troponin-I elevation are predictors of mortality.

TI  - A Review of Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Therapeutic Repurposing and Unmet Clinical Needs
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - For the initial phase of pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), repurposing drugs that in vitro inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been attempted with overlooked or overestimated efficacy owing to limited clinical evidence. Most early clinical trials have the defects of study design, small sample size, non-randomized design, or different timings of treatment initiation. However, well-designed studies on asymptomatic or mild, or pediatric cases of COVID-19 are scarce and desperately needed to meet the clinical need. However, a trend could be observed based on current clinical evidence. Remdesivir and favipiravir may shorten the recovery time; lopinavir/ritonavir does not demonstrate treatment efficacy in severe patients. Triple therapy of ribavirin, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1b showed early viral negative conversion, and the major effect may be related to interferon. Some small sample-size studies showed that interleukin-6 inhibitors may demonstrate clinical improvement; non-critical patients may benefit from convalescent plasma infusion in small sample-size studies; and the role of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 remains unclear. Combination therapy of traditional Chinese medicine with antiviral agents (ex. interferon, lopinavir, or arbidol) may alleviate inflammation in severe COVID-19 patients based on small sample-sized observational studies and experts' opinion. Most of the published studies included severe or critical patients with COVID-19. Combination therapy of antiviral agents and immune-modulating drugs is reasonable especially for those critical COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome. Drugs to blunt cytokine release might not benefit for patients in the early stage with mild disease or the late stage with critical illness. Traditional Chinese medicine with antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2 and immune-modulation is widely used for COVID-19 patients in China, and is worthy of further studies. In this review, we aim to highlight the available therapeutic options for COVID-19 based on current clinical evidence and encourage clinical trials specific for children and for patients with mild disease or at the early stage of COVID-19.

TI  - Favipiravir use in children with COVID-19 and acute kidney injury: is it safe?
T2  - PEDIATRIC NEPHROLOGY
AB  - Background The rising number of infections due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (popularly known as COVID-19) has brought to the fore new antiviral drugs as possible treatments, including favipiravir. However, there is currently no data regarding the safety of this drug in patients with kidney impairment. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to share our experience of the use of favipiravir in pediatric patients affected by COVID-19 with any degree of kidney impairment. Methods The study enrolled pediatric patients aged under 18 years and confirmed as suffering from COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with any degree of kidney injury, who were treated with favipiravir at the time of admission. Results Out of a total of 11 patients, 7 were diagnosed with MIS-C and 4 with severe COVID-19. The median age of the cases was 15.45 (9-17.8) years and the male/female ratio was 7/4. At the time of admission, the median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl. Nine patients were treated with favipiravir for 5 days, and 2 patients for 5 days followed by remdesivir for 5-10 days despite kidney injury at the time of admission. Seven patients underwent plasma exchange for MIS-C while 2 severely affected cases underwent continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) as well. One severe COVID-19 patient received plasma exchange as well as CKRT. Serum creatinine values returned to normal in mean 3.07 days. Conclusions Favipiravir seems a suitable therapeutic option in patients affected by COVID-19 with kidney injury without a need for dose adjustment.

TI  - An Overview of COVID-19 Medicines in Current Guidelines
T2  - BEZMIALEM SCIENCE
AB  - An acute respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus (Severe acute respirotary syndrome-coronavirus-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), appeared in December 2019 and then has spread rapidly throughout the world starting from China, Japan and South Korea. As of January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization has officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak. Considering the clinical symptoms of COVID-19, it has many symptoms such as high fever, cough, and fatigue. It is reported that this disease is very severe and causes serious consequences such as cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome in the elderly and those with chronic diseases. Currently, scientists are trying to find a specific antiviral treatment strategy. Various medications such as hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, remdesivir and favipiravir are currently being applied in clinical trials to test their efficacy and safety worldwide in COVID-19 treatment, and some promising results have been achieved so far. In this review, agents with potential efficacy against COVID-19 are presented in summary.

TI  - Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients hospitalised with COVID-19: clinical outcomes in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in December 2019. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from asymptomatic to severe and potentially fatal. We aimed to describe the clinical and laboratory features and outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 within the Abu Dhabi Healthcare Services Facilities (SEHA). Methods Our retrospective analysis of patient data collected from electronic health records (EHRs) available from the SEHA health information system included all patients admitted from 1 March to 31 May 2020 with a laboratory-confirmed PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data of clinical features, co-morbidities, laboratory markers, length of hospital stay, treatment received and mortality were analysed according to severe versus non-severe disease. Results The study included 9390 patients. Patients were divided into severe and non-severe groups. Seven hundred twenty-one (7.68%) patients required intensive care, whereas the remaining patients (92.32%) had mild or moderate disease. The mean patient age of our cohort (41.8 years) was lower than the global average. Our population had male predominance, and it included various nationalities. The major co-morbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Laboratory tests revealed significant differences in lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and creatinine levels and the neutrophil count between the severe and non-severe groups. The most common anti-viral therapy was the combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Favipiravir. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 1.63%, although the rate was 19.56% in the severe group. The mortality rate was higher in adults younger than 30 years than in those older than 60 years (2.3% vs. 0.95%). Conclusions Our analysis suggested that Abu Dhabi had lower COVID-19 morbidity and mortalities rates were less than the reported rates then in China, Italy and the US. The affected population was relatively young, and it had an international representation. Globally, Abu Dhabi had one of the highest testing rates in relation to the population volume. We believe the early identification of patients and their younger age resulted in more favourable outcomes.

TI  - Target SARS-CoV-2: theoretical exploration on clinical suitability of certain drugs
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - We propose a unique theoretical methodology because of the global high priority rating to search for the repurposed drugs that outfit clinical suitability to SARS-CoV-2. The approach is based on the exploration of structural analysis, computation of biothermodynamics, interactions and the prediction of entropy sign successively via molecular dynamics. We tested this methodology for Favipiravir/Dolutegravir drugs on the apo form of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. This theoretical exploration not only suggested the presence of strong interactions between (SARS-CoV-2 + Favipiravir/Dolutegravir) but also emphasized the clinical suitability of Favipiravir over Dolutegravir to treat SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The supremacy of Favipiravir over Doultegravir is well supported by the results of global clinical trials on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, this work will pave the way for incremental advancement towards future design and development of more specific inhibitors to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

TI  - Novel SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-2019 Outbreak: Current Perspectives on Plant-Based Antiviral Agents and Complementary Therapy
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the novel Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been defined as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2020. The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus as a global health emergency has emphasized to findeffective treatment strategies in clinical trials. The several drug trials including Lopinavir (LPV) and Ritonavir, Chioroquine (CLQ), Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir (FPV), Remdevisir (RDV), Nitazoxanide, Ivermectin and Interferon, have been explored in COVID-19 patients and some of the drugs have been waiting clinical approval for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. Clinical trials are still ongoing to discover promising new multidrug combination treatment for COVID-19 patients. Considering the difficulties to ascertain efficient drug candidates and the lack of specific anti-viral therapies against COVID-19 outbreak, the current management of SARS-CoV-2 should mainly be supportive. From this point of view, enhancing the immune system through medicinal plants with wide range of bioactive compounds, which exhibit antiviral activities, can play significant roles to increase defense barrier in COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, plant-based agents as complementary and alternative therapies have potential advantages to reduce symptoms of this life-threatening disease and could promote the public health. Recently, there has been a remarkable progress in the field of antiviral herbal therapy owing to increasing concerns about the development of drug resistance and limited advances in the field of antiviral drug discovery. This review provides an overview of published information onbiology, genomic structure, replication cycle and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. It also aims to assemble the fact and a scientific intellectual groundwork on development of antiviral herbal therapy on the bases of extensive literature collection.

TI  - Favipiravir Effects on the Control of Clinical Symptoms of Hospitalized COVID-19 Cases: An Experience with Iranian Formulated Dosage Form
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has gradually spread worldwide, becoming a major public health event. This situation requires designing a novel antiviral agent against the SARS-CoV-2; however, this is time-consuming and the use of repurposed medicines may be promising. One such medicine is favipiravir, primarily introduced as an anti-influenza agent in east world. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in comparison with lopinavir-ritonavir in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this randomized clinical trial, 62 patients were recruited. These patients had bilateral pulmonary infiltration with peripheral oxygen saturation lower than 93%. The median time from symptoms onset to intervention initiation was seven days. Favipiravir was not available in the Iranian pharmaceutical market, and it was decided to formulate it at the research laboratory of School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. The patients received favipiravir tablet at a dose of 1600 mg orally twice a day for day one and then 600 mg orally twice a day for days 2 to 6. In the second group, the patients received lopinavir-ritonavir combination tablet at a dose of 200/50 mg twice a day for seven days. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were improved significantly in favipiravir group in comparison with lopinavir-ritonavir group on days four and five. Mortality rate and ICU stay in both groups were similar, and there was no significant difference in this regard (P = 0.463 and P = 0.286, respectively). Chest X-ray improvement also was not significantly different between the two groups. Adverse drug reactions occurred in both groups, and impaired liver enzymes were the most frequent adverse effect. In conclusion, early administration of oral favipiravir may reduce the duration of clinical signs and symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and hospitalization period. The mortality rate also should be investigated in future clinical trials.

TI  - Existing Drugs Considered as Promising in COVID-19 Therapy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease at first was identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Being a human infectious disease, it causes high fever, cough, breathing problems. In some cases it can be fatal, especially in people with comorbidities like heart or kidney problems and diabetes. The current COVID-19 treatment is based on symptomatic therapy, so finding an appropriate drug against COVID-19 remains an immediate and crucial target for the global scientific community. Two main processes are thought to be responsible for the COVID-19 pathogenesis. In the early stages of infection, disease is determined mainly by virus replication. In the later stages of infection, by an excessive immune/inflammatory response, leading to tissue damage. Therefore, the main treatment options are antiviral and immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory agents. Many clinical trials have been conducted concerning the use of various drugs in COVID-19 therapy, and many are still ongoing. The majority of trials examine drug reposition (repurposing), which seems to be a good and effective option. Many drugs have been repurposed in COVID-19 therapy including remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab and baricitinib. The aim of this review is to highlight (based on existing and accessible clinical evidence on ongoing trials) the current and available promising drugs for COVID-19 and outline their characteristics.

TI  - nCOVID-19 Pandemic: From Molecular Pathogenesis to Potential Investigational Therapeutics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB  - In December 2019, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related epidemic was first observed in Wuhan, China. In 2020, owing to the highly infectious and deadly nature of the virus, this widespread novel coronavirus disease 2019 (nCOVID-19) became a worldwide pandemic. Studies have revealed that various environmental factors including temperature, humidity, and air pollution may also affect the transmission pattern of COVID-19. Unfortunately, still, there is no specific drug that has been validated in large-scale studies to treat patients with confirmed nCOVID-19. However, remdesivir, an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), has appeared as an auspicious antiviral drug. Currently, a large-scale study on remdesivir (i.e., 200 mg on first day, then 100 mg once/day) is ongoing to evaluate its clinical efficacy to treat nCOVID-19. Good antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 was not observed with the use of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). Nonetheless, the combination of umifenovir and LPV/r was found to have better antiviral activity. Furthermore, a combination of hydroxychloroquine (i.e., 200 mg 3 times/day) and azithromycin (i.e., 500 mg on first day, then 250 mg/day from day 2-5) also exhibited good activity. Currently, there are also ongoing studies to evaluate the efficacy of teicoplanin and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, in this article, we have analyzed the genetic diversity and molecular pathogenesis of nCOVID-19. We also present possible therapeutic options for nCOVID-19 patients.

TI  - Guidelines for clinical management of SARS-Cov-2 infection
T2  - GACETA MEDICA DE MEXICO
AB  - In SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), the most common manifestations involve the upper airways; in complicated cases, bilateral interstitial pneumonia, severe acute respiratory failure and multiple organ failure occur, which require hospital treatment and ventilatory support with nasal cannula or mask and high flow oxygen, or orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. There are no specific antivirals, and thus management is symptomatic, as well as with antiplatelet drugs (acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole), low molecular weight hepan'n when there is hypercoagulability (increased D-dimer), dexamethasone when inflammation indicators are elevated; experimentally, under informed consent, antibiotics are used according to microbiological results, as well as interferon beta 1b, favipiravir, tocilizumab, ivermectin and immunoglobulin G. When gastroenteritis occurs, nitazoxanide can be indicated.

TI  - Potential of Marine Terpenoids against SARS-CoV-2: An In Silico Drug Development Approach
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
AB  - In an emergency, drug repurposing is the best alternative option against newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, several bioactive natural products have shown potential against SARS-CoV-2 in recent studies. The present study selected sixty-eight broad-spectrum antiviral marine terpenoids and performed molecular docking against two novel SARS-CoV-2 enzymes (main protease or M-pro or 3CL(pro)) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In addition, the present study analysed the physiochemical-toxicity-pharmacokinetic profile, structural activity relationship, and phylogenetic tree with various computational tools to select the 'lead' candidate. The genomic diversity study with multiple sequence analyses and phylogenetic tree confirmed that the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 strain was up to 96% structurally similar to existing CoV-strains. Furthermore, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency based on a protein-ligand docking score (kcal/mol) exposed that the marine terpenoid brevione F (-8.4) and stachyflin (-8.4) exhibited similar activity with the reference antiviral drugs lopinavir (-8.4) and darunavir (-7.5) against the target SARS-CoV-M-pro. Similarly, marine terpenoids such as xiamycin (-9.3), thyrsiferol (-9.2), liouvilloside B (-8.9), liouvilloside A (-8.8), and stachyflin (-8.7) exhibited comparatively higher docking scores than the referral drug remdesivir (-7.4), and favipiravir (-5.7) against the target SARS-CoV-2-RdRp. The above in silico investigations concluded that stachyflin is the most 'lead' candidate with the most potential against SARS-CoV-2. Previously, stachyflin also exhibited potential activity against HSV-1 and CoV-A59 within IC50, 0.16-0.82 mu M. Therefore, some additional pharmacological studies are needed to develop 'stachyflin' as a drug against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Current drugs with potential for coronavirus disease 2019 therapy: a literature review
T2  - REVIEWS IN MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the WHO on 2020 a novel disease with no confirmed and precise therapeutic agent. Lopinavir/ ritonavir has shown no benefit in 199 COVID-19 hospitalized adult patients compared with standard care alone. Remdesivir has shown promising results in the first case of COVID-19 in the USA, but recent reports were disappointing and still are under more investigation in clinical trials. The arbidol (Umifenovir) and Favipiravir act well in postexposure prophylaxis and viral clearance. Interferons in combination with other antiviral agents, if administered in the early stages of the disease, can cause advantageous effects. Ribavirin is no more recommended in new guidelines. Tocilizumab (Actemra) is an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19 and a new therapeutic strategy. Systemic corticosteroids seem to have a great impact in reducing mortality rate in mechanically ventilated patients. There are also some supplementary agents such as vitamin C, A, D, selenium, and zinc that have been reported to be effective in the prevention and treatment of viral infections. Recent findings indicate human recombinant soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, niclosamide, and ivermectin had strong in-vitro results which can lead to fast in-vivo trials and help us to control infection.

TI  - A comprehensive update on the structure and synthesis of potential drug targets for combating the coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2
T2  - ARCHIV DER PHARMAZIE
AB  - The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 created by its severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant, known for producing a very severe acute respiratory syndrome, has created an unprecedented situation by its continual assault around the world. The crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 variant has been a global challenge, calling to mitigate this unprecedented pandemic that has engulfed the whole world. Since the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, many researchers globally have been grappling to find new clinically trialed active drugs with anti-COVID-19 activity, from antimalarial drugs to JAK inhibitors, antiviral drugs, immune suppressants, and so forth. This article presents a brief discussion on the activity and synthesis of some active molecules such as favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, pirfenidone, remdesivir, lopinavir, camostat, chloroquine, baricitinib, molnupiravir, and so forth, which are under trial.

TI  - Monitoring of viral load by RT-PCR caused decision making to continue ECMO therapy for a patient with COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Most patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have just only mild symptoms, but about 5% are very severe. Although extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) is sometimes used in critically patients with COVID-19, ECMO is only an adjunct, not the main treatment. If the patient's condition deteriorates and it is determined to be irreversible, it is necessary to decide to stop ECMO.
   A 54-year-old man was admitted on day 6 of onset with a chief complaint of high fever and cough. Computed tomography (CT) showed a ground glass opacity in both lungs, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnosed COVID-19. He was admitted to the hospital and started to receive oxygen and favipiravir. After that, his respiratory condition deteriorated, and he was intubated and ventilated on day 9 of onset, and ECMO was introduced on day 12. Two days after the introduction of ECMO, C-reactive protein (CRP) increased, chest X-p showed no improvement in pneumonia, and PaO2/FiO2 decreased again. As D-dimer rose and found a blood clot in the ECMO circuit, we had to decide whether to replace the circuit and continue with ECMO or stop ECMO. At this time, the viral load by RTPCR was drastically reduced to about 1/1750. We decided to continue ECMO therapy and replaced the circuit. The patient's respiratory status subsequently improved and ECMO was stopped on day 21 of onset.
   In conclusion, viral load measurement by RT-PCR may be one of the indicators for promoting the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. (c) 2020 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparative review of respiratory diseases caused by coronaviruses and influenza A viruses during epidemic season
T2  - MICROBES AND INFECTION
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to sweep the world, causing infection of millions and death of hundreds of thousands. The respiratory disease that it caused, COVID19 (stands for coronavirus disease in 2019), has similar clinical symptoms with other two CoV diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome (SARS and MERS), of which causative viruses are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. These three CoVs resulting diseases also share many clinical symptoms with other respiratory diseases caused by influenza A viruses (IAVs). Since both CoVs and IAVs are general pathogens responsible for seasonal cold, in the next few months, during the changing of seasons, clinicians and public heath may have to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other kinds of viral pneumonia. This is a discussion and comparison of the virus structures, transmission characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, pathological changes, treatment and prevention of the two kinds of viruses, CoVs and IAVs. It hopes to provide information for practitioners in the medical field during the epidemic season. (c) 2020 Institut Pasteur. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Computational Analysis Reveals Monomethylated Triazolopyrimidine as a Novel Inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp)
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - The human population is still facing appalling conditions due to several outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The absence of specific drugs, appropriate vaccines for mutants, and knowledge of potential therapeutic agents makes this situation more difficult. Several 1, 2, 4-triazolo [1, 5-a] pyrimidine (TP)-derivative compounds were comprehensively studied for antiviral activities against RNA polymerase of HIV, HCV, and influenza viruses, and showed immense pharmacological interest. Therefore, TP-derivative compounds can be repurposed against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to ensure the genomic variability and stability of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein. The molecular docking of natural and synthetic TP compounds to RdRp and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to analyse the dynamic behaviour of TP compounds at the active site of the RdRp protein. TP compounds were also docked against other non-structural proteins (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP5, NSP8, NSP13, and NSP15) of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the inhibition potential of TP compounds was compared with Remdesivir and Favipiravir drugs as a positive control. Additionally, TP compounds were analysed for inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV RdRp protein. This study demonstrates that TP analogues (monomethylated triazolopyrimidine and essramycin) represent potential lead molecules for designing an effective inhibitor to control viral replication. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies will strengthen the use of these inhibitors as suitable drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Current Status of Treatment Options, Clinical Trials, and Vaccine Development for SARS-CoV-2 Infection
T2  - JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus first discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019 causes the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), which presents with a wide range of clinical symptoms from mild or moderate to severe and critical illnesses. With the continuing transmission of the virus worldwide and the rapidly evolving situation globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic in March. Currently, there is no proven specific treatment for this potentially deadly disease beyond supportive care. However, a massive effort has been put globally into the investigation of medications and other interventional measures to fight COVID-19. Convalescent plasma therapy from recovered patients has recently drawn considerable interest. Several alternative medical treatments, although evidence of their efficacy still lacking, have also gained popularity, especially in countries with such traditions such as India and China. Rapid repurposing of drugs for COVID-19 has revealed a few promising candidate antiviral agents, but further research, especially high quality randomized controlled trials, will be needed to prove their efficacy and safety in the clinical use to treat COVID-19. Vaccine development has been the imperative task in the battle against SARS-CoV-2. While clinical trials have been launched for several candidate vaccines, research on COVID-19 vaccines is still at an early stage. So far, optimized supportive care remains the best practice against COVID-19.

TI  - Medication therapy strategies for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): recent progress and challenges
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread globally since it outbroke in December 2019. The urgent pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to develop and identify effective medication therapy strategies to combat the COVID-19. Areas covered Here, we summarized and evaluated the current treatment drugs and regimens, and put forward the treatment recommendations, including using the potential repurposed or experimental drugs against COVID-19, e.g. chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), remdesivir (RDV), and favipiravir (FPV). We also analyzed the specific drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 ongoing development and formulated the comprehensive treatment regimens based on condition of patients, diseases and drugs as well as concomitant medications. Expert opinion No drugs and vaccines have been proven to be particularly effective against SARS-CoV-2 up to now. The recommended comprehensive medication therapy strategies have already displayed favorable effect in the fight against COVID-19. Research should be focused on the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and vaccines based on high-quality clinical trial evidence, treatment guidelines and expert consensus.

TI  - CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020: a striking new hope in COVID-19 therapy
T2  - MOLECULAR DIVERSITY
AB  - Designing anticoronavirus disease 2019 (anti-COVID-19) agents is the primary concern of medicinal chemists/drug designers nowadays. Repurposing of known active compounds against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new effective and time-saving trend in anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. Thorough inhibition of the coronaviral-2 proteins (i.e., multitarget inhibition) is a possible powerful favorable strategy for developing effectively potent drugs for COVID-19. In this new research study, I succeeded to repurpose the two antioxidant polyhydroxy-1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as the first multitarget coronaviral protein blockers with extremely higher potencies (reach about 65 and 304 times, for CoViTris2020, and 20 and 93 times, for ChloViD2020, more potent than remdesivir and favipiravir, respectively). These two 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were computationally studied (through molecular docking in almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins) and biologically assessed (through a newly established robust in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay) for their anticoronaviral-2 bioactivities. The data obtained from the docking investigation showed that both ligands promisingly exhibited very strong inhibitory binding affinities with almost all docked enzymes (e.g., they displayed extremely lower binding energies of - 12.00 and - 9.60 kcal/mol, respectively, with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase "RdRp"). The results of the biological assay revealed that CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 significantly displayed very high anti-COVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 = 0.31 and 1.01 mu M, respectively). Further in vivo/clinical studies for the development of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as anti-COVID-19 medications are required. In brief, the ascent of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as the two lead members of the novel family of anti-COVID-19 polyphenolic 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives represents a promising hope in COVID-19 therapy. Graphic abstract CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 life cycle with surprising EC50 values of 0.31 and 1.01 mu M, respectively. CoViTris2020 strongly inhibits coronaviral-2 RdRp with exceptionally lower inhibitory binding energy of - 12.00 kcal/mol.

TI  - Risk Assessment of Drug-Induced Long QT Syndrome for Some COVID-19 Repurposed Drugs
T2  - CTS-CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE
AB  - The risk-benefit ratio associated with the use of repurposed drugs to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is complicated because benefits are awaited, not proven. A thorough literature search was conducted to source information on the pharmacological properties of 5 drugs and 1 combination (azithromycin, chloroquine, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir) repurposed to treat COVID-19. A risk assessment of drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) associated with COVID-19 repurposed drugs was performed and compared with 23 well-known torsadogenic and 10 low torsadogenic risk compounds. Computer calculations were performed using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, including affinity to block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier cardiac potassium current (I-Kr) encoded by the human ether-a-go-go gene (hERG), propensity to prolong cardiac repolarization (QT interval) and cause torsade de pointes (TdP). Seven different LQTS indices were calculated and compared. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database was queried with specific key words relating to arrhythmogenic events. Estimators of LQTS risk levels indicated a very high or moderate risk for all COVID-19 repurposed drugs with the exception for azithromycin, although cases of TdP have been reported with this drug. There was excellent agreement among the various indices used to assess risk of drug-induced LQTS for the 6 repurposed medications and 23 torsadogenic compounds. Based on our results, monitoring of the QT interval shall be performed when some COVID-19 repurposed drugs are used, as such monitoring is possible for hospitalized patients or with the use of biodevices for outpatients.

TI  - Cyanorona-20: The first potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Explicit hindrance and blockade of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered one of the most promising and efficient approaches for developing highly potent remedies for COVID-19. However, almost all of the reported viral RdRp inhibitors (either repurposed or new antiviral drugs) lack specific selectivity against the novel coronaviral RdRp and still at a beginning phase of advancement. Herein, I discovered and introduce a new pyrazine derivative, (E)-N-(4-cyanobenzylidene)-6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (cyanorona-20), as the first potent SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor with very high selectivity (209-and 45-fold more potent than favipiravir and remdesivir, respectively). This promising selective specific anti-COVID-19 compound is also deemed to be the first distinctive derivative of favipiravir. Cyanorona-20, the unprecedented nucleoside/nucleotide analog, was designed, synthesized, characterized, computationally studied, and biologically evaluated for its anti-COVID-19 actions (through a precise in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay). The results of the biological assay displayed that cyanorona-20 surprisingly exhibited very high and largely significant antiCOVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 = 0.45 mu M), and, in addition, it could be also a very promising guide and lead compound for the design and synthesis of new anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-COVID-19 agents through structural modifications and further computational studies. Further appraisal for the improvement of cyanorona20 medication is a prerequisite requirement in the coming days. In a word, the ascent of the second member (cyanorona-20 "Corona Antidote") of the novel and promising class of anti-COVID-19 pyrazine derivatives would drastically make a medical uprising in the pharmacotherapeutic treatment regimens and protocols of the recently-emerged SARS-CoV-2 infection and its accompanying COVID-19.

TI  - Sotrovimab Lowers the Risk of COVID-19 Related Hospitalization or Death in a Large Population Cohort in the United Arab Emirates
T2  - CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Sotrovimab, an anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 monoclonal antibody is being utilized to prevent progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, to understand its benefits, we have conducted a retrospective analysis of all non-hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19 who received a single infusion of sotrovimab and/or oral favipiravir at any Dubai COVID-19 related healthcare center between July 1, 2021, and October 31, 2021. The main outcome was to evaluate the risk of hospitalization for patients with COVID-19 or all-cause death within 28 days of treatment initiation. In this analysis, which included 10,882 patients (1,135 in the sotrovimab group, 2,653 in the sotrovimab/favipiravir group, and 7,094 in the favipiravir group), sotrovimab or sotrovimab/favipiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization (13 patients (1.5%) in the sotrovimab group and 71 patients (2.9%) in the sotrovimab/favipiravir group vs. 251 patients (4%) in the favipiravir group; hazard ratio (HR) for sotrovimab: 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09-0.28, P < 0.001; and for sotrovimab/favipiravir, HR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.32-0.56, P < 0.001), or death by day 28 from the start of treatment (no death in the sotrovimab group and 2 deaths in the the sotrovimab/favipiravir group vs. 10 deaths in the favipiravir group; odds ratio: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.81, P = 026). Safety was assessed in all the 3,788 patients in the sotrovimab and sotrovimab/favipiravir groups, and the reported adverse events were by 34 patients (<1%). In conclusion, sotrovimab was found to reduce the risk of progression of COVID-19 when administrated early to non-hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19. No safety concern was detected.

TI  - TAT-peptide conjugated repurposing drug against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro): Potential therapeutic intervention to combat COVID-19
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB  - The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Chinese city of Wuhan has caused around 906,092 deaths and 28,040,853 confirmed cases worldwide (https://covid19.who.int/, 11 September 2020). In a life-threatening situation, where there is no specific and licensed anti-COVID-19 vaccine or medicine available; the repurposed drug might act as a silver bullet. Currently, more than 211 vaccines, 80 antibodies, 31 antiviral drugs, 35 cell-based, 6 RNA-based and 131 other drugs are in clinical trials. It is therefore utter need of the hour to develop an effective drug that can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 before a vaccine can be developed. One of the best-characterized and attractive drug targets among coronaviruses is the main protease (3CL(pro)). Therefore, the current study focuses on the molecular docking analysis of TAT-peptide(47) (57 )(GRKKRRQRRRP)-conjugated repurposed drugs (i.e., lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine) with SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CL(pro)) to discover potential efficacy of TAT-peptide (TP) - conjugated repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The molecular docking results validated that TP-conjugated ritonavir, lopinavir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine have superior and significantly enhanced interactions with the target SARS-CoV-2 main protease. In-silico approach employed in this study suggests that the combination of the drug with TP is an excelling alternative to develop a novel drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The development of TP based delivery of repurposing drugs might be an excellent approach to enhance the efficacy of the existing drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. The predictions from the results obtained provide invaluable information that can be utilized for the choice of candidate drugs for in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials. The outcome from this work prove crucial for exploring and developing novel cost-effective and biocompatible TP conjugated anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agents in immediate future.

TI  - Treatment Considerations for COVID-19: A Critical Review of the Evidence (or Lack Thereof)
T2  - MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS
AB  - The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is causing a worldwide pandemic that may lead to a highly morbid and potentially fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is currently no drug that has been proven as an effective therapy for COVID-19. Several candidate drugs are being considered and evaluated for treatment. This includes clinically available drugs, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir, which are being repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. Novel experimental therapies, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, are also actively being investigated for antiviral efficacy. Clinically available and investigational immunomodulators, such as the interleukin 6 inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab and the anti-granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor lenzilumab, are being tested for their anticipated effect in counteracting the proinflammatory cytokine environment that characterizes severe and critical COVID-19. This review article examines the evidence behind the potential use of these leading drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. The authors conclude, based on this review, that there is still no high-quality evidence to support any of these proposed drug therapies. The authors, therefore, encourage the enrollment of eligible patients to multiple ongoing clinical trials that assess the efficacy and safety of these candidate therapies. Until the results of controlled trials are available, none of the suggested therapeutics is clinically proven as an effective therapy for COVID-19.

TI  - Favipiravir use for SARS CoV-2 infection
T2  - PHARMACOLOGICAL REPORTS
AB  - Introduction The pandemic of SARS CoV-2 has required urgent medical treatments for numerous patients. As no specific antiviral agents were available, different off-the-shelf alternatives have been explored. Objective Here, we review the rationale behind the use of Favipiravir, and report of the specific studies supporting this treatment being conducted. Methods Here we analyze the relevant literature to conclude about the present opportunities offered by this therapeutic agent. Results This antiviral drug approved influenza in Japan since 2014, has a demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS CoV-2 and is being investigated in several trials for SARS CoV-2. Signals of benefit were shown in a small trial for SARS CoV-2. However, in another small study, there was no advantage. Conclusions Further studies, statistically more significant, are urgently needed to understand the best opportunities offered by this treatment.

TI  - Evaluation of risk factors for uric acid elevation in COVID-19 patients treated with favipiravir
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - The objective of this retrospective study was to identify the clinical risk factor associated with uric acid elevation in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients treated with favipiravir. Uric acid elevation was defined as an unexplained increase of >= 1.5 times in the patient's uric acid level from baseline. Twenty-nine COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Uric acid elevation developed during favipiravir therapy in 12 (41.4%) patients and the median onset time was 4.5 days after starting favipiravir. In multiple logistic regression analysis, the favipiravir dosage (adjusted OR = 1.69 [1.02-2.81], P = 0.044) and younger patient age (adjusted OR = 0.91 [0.83-0.99], P = 0.040) were significant clinical risk factors for uric acid elevation. No significant between-group difference was noted in the uric acid elevation and non-elevation groups in the clinical recovery after favipiravir therapy. The uric acid levels of patients administered with favipiravir should be monitored closely. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Observational study of the effects of Favipiravir vs Lopinavir/Ritonavir on clinical outcomes in critically Ill patients with COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS
AB  - What is known and objectives In November 2019, several patients were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China. So far, there are no specific treatments with proven high efficacy in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Presently, several drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin, favipiravir (FVP), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), remdesivir and oseltamivir, have been suggested as effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical experience with FPV and LPV/r in critically ill patients with COVID-19 at Sakarya University Education and Research Hospital.
   Methods The study included 107 consecutive patients who had a laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 19 March and 19 May 2020. Follow-up continued through 30 May 2020 when the last observed patients were discharged.
   Results and discussion Of the 107 patients, 65 received FPV (Group FPV) and 42 received LPV/r (Group LPV/r). The two groups were similar in terms of demographic data and clinical findings. 43 (66.2%) of the 65 patients in the FPV group and 23 (54.8%) of the 42 patients in the LPV/r group died (p = 0.237). The median ICU stay was 6.6 (IQR, 3-10) days in the FPV group and 9 (IQR, 6-16) days in the LPV/r group, which was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.010).
   What is new and conclusion The length of hospital stay was significantly lower in the FVP group compared to the LPV/r group among patients who were discharged from the ICU. Although the analysis was done with a limited number of patients and the observed difference in mortality rate is of some concern, FVP treatment may be more beneficial than LPV/r in terms of effective use in the ICU.

TI  - Recommendations for Dosing of Repurposed COVID-19 Medications in Patients with Renal and Hepatic Impairment
T2  - DRUGS IN R&D
AB  - Introduction In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began, resulting in a number of antivirals and immune modulators being repurposed to treat the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many patients requiring treatment for COVID-19 may have either pre-existing renal or hepatic disease or experience acute renal/hepatic injury as a result of the acute infection. Altered renal or hepatic function can significantly affect drug concentrations of medications due to impaired drug metabolism and excretion, resulting in toxicity or reduced efficacy. The aim of this paper is to review the pharmacokinetics and available study data for the experimental COVID-19 therapies in patients with any degree of renal or hepatic impairment to make recommendations for dosing.
   Methods COVID-19 agents included in these recommendations were listed as primaries on the University of Liverpool COVID-19 drug interaction website (www.covid19-druginteractions.org), initially identified from Clinicialtrials.gov and ChicCTR.org.cn. A literature search was performed using PubMed and EMBASE as well as product licences and pharmacokinetic databases.
   Findings Remdesivir, dexamethasone, azithromycin, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir, hydroxychloroquine, interferon beta, ribavirin, tocilizumab, anakinra and sarilumab were identified as experimental drugs being used in COVID-19 trials as of November 2020. Limited study data was found for these drugs in patients with renal or hepatic impairment for COVID-19 or other indications. Recommendations were made based on available data, consideration of pharmacokinetic properties (including variability), the dosing and anticipated treatment duration of each regimen in COVID-19 and known toxicities.
   Conclusion Dosing of drugs used to treat COVID-19 in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is complex. These recommendations were produced to provide guidance to clinicians worldwide who are treating patients with COVID-19, many of whom will have some degree of acute or chronic renal or hepatic impairment.

TI  - Antiviral treatment of COVID-19: a clinical pharmacology narrative review
T2  - MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDONESIA
AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019 in China, has become a pandemic in March 2020. Repurposing old and relatively safe drugs becomes an advantageous option to obtain the urgently needed effective treatment. Repurposing chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir, and the use of investigational drug remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19, are reviewed from the clinical pharmacology perspective, particularly its efficacy and safety. Limited clinical studies of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, and remdesivir showed some efficacy in COVID-19 treatment with tolerable adverse effects. Potential serious adverse effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is cardiac arrhythmia. Oseltamivir has no documented activity against SARS-CoV-2, while lopinavir/ritonavir showed limited efficacy in COVID-19. Currently, there is no sufficient evidence to recommend any specific anti-COVID-19 treatment. The decision to use these drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic must be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks to the patient.

TI  - Recent progress of antiviral therapy for coronavirus disease 2019
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global public health crisis, for which antiviral treatments are considered mainstream therapeutic approaches. With the development of this pandemic, the number of clinical studies on antiviral therapy, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, arbidol, interferon, favipiravir, oseltamivir, nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, and camostat mesylate, has been increasing. However, the efficacy of these antiviral drugs for COVID-19 remains controversial. In this review, we summarize the recent progress and findings on antiviral therapies, aiming to provide clinical support for the management of COVID-19. In addition, we analyze the causes of controversy in antiviral drug research and discuss the quality of current studies on antiviral treatments. High-quality randomized clinical trials are required to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

T2  - FLORA INFEKSIYON HASTALIKLARI VE KLINIK MIKROBIYOLOJI DERGISI
AB  - There are treatment options with partially shown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. A drug with proven effect on survival has not yet been developed for the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) defined in December 2019. Many chemicals that are being used or developed for different indications have been used for COVID-19 treatment, based on their effects observed in in vitro studies. Favipiravir, one of these drugs, was first used in Wuhan, the starting center of the pandemic. Since the spread of the infection to the world, it has been used in our country as well as countries such as Italy, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Moldova and Kazakhstan, Bangladesh, Egypt, India. There are few studies conducted and published to evaluate the effectiveness of favipiravir, but many studies are ongoing. In this review,& nbsp;it was aimed to review and evaluate the studies and case reports reporting the efficacy of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19. With the literature search, 223 results were reached, 210 articles were fully accessed, and a total of 34 articles were included in the analysis. In the scope of the review, under the title of pharmacology of favipiravir, adverse effects and drug interactions in addition to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are mentioned. Favipiravir is one of the options for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but randomized, controlled trials involving much more patients and longer follow-up periods need to be planned and the results of ongoing trials evaluated.

TI  - Early antiviral and supervisory dexamethasone treatment improve clinical outcomes of nonsevere COVID-19 patients
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of early antiviral treatment in preventing clinical deterioration in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected (COVID-19) patients in home isolation and to share our experiences with the ambulatory management of nonsevere COVID-19 patients. This retrospective study included mild COVID-19 adult patients confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. They received care via an ambulatory management strategy between July 2021 and November 2021. Demographic data, clinical progression, and outcomes were collected. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were performed to illustrate the cohort's characteristic and outcomes of the study. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were employed to investigate the associations between clinical factors and disease progression. A total of 1940 patients in the Siriraj home isolation system met the inclusion criteria. Their mean age was 42.1 +/- 14.9 years, with 14.2% older than 60 years, 54.3% female, and 7.1% with a body weight >= 90kg. Only 115 patients (5.9%) had deterioration of clinical symptoms. Two-thirds of these could be managed at home by dexamethasone treatment under physician supervision; however, 38 of the 115 patients (2.0% of the study cohort) needed hospitalization. Early favipiravir outpatient treatment (<= 5 days from onset of symptoms) in nonsevere COVID-19 patients was significantly associated with a lower rate of symptom deterioration than late favipiravir treatment (50 [4.6%] vs 65 [7.5%] patients, respectively; P=.008; odds ratio 1.669; 95% confidence interval, 1.141-2.441). The unfavorable prognostic factors for symptom deterioration were advanced age, body weight >= 90kg, unvaccinated status, higher reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold, and late favipiravir treatment. The early delivery of essential treatment, including antiviral and supervisory dexamethasone, to ambulatory nonsevere COVID-19 patients yielded favorable outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand.

TI  - Possible therapeutic agents for COVID-19: a comprehensive review
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTI-INFECTIVE THERAPY
AB  - Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in China. There are no available vaccines or antiviral drugs for COVID-19 patients. Herein, we represented possible therapeutic agents that may stand as a potential therapy against COVID-19. Areas covered We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov for relevant papers. We showed some agents with potentially favorable efficacy, acceptable safety as well as good pharmacokinetic profiles. Several therapies are under assessment to evaluate their efficacy and safety for COVID-19. However, some drugs were withdrawn due to their side effects after demonstrating some clinical efficacy. Indeed, the most effective therapies could be organ function support, convalescent plasma, anticoagulants, and immune as well as antiviral therapies, especially anti-influenza drugs due to the similarities between respiratory viruses regarding viral entry, uncoating, and replication. We encourage giving more attention to favipiravir, remdesivir, and measles vaccine. Expert opinion A combination, at least dual or even triple therapy, of the aforementioned efficacious and safe therapies is greatly recommended for COVID-19. Further, patients should have a routine assessment for their coagulation and bleeding profiles as well as their inflammatory and cytokine concentrations.

TI  - COVID-19-Related Pneumonia in an Adolescent Patient with Allergic Asthma
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background. The latest coronavirus infection due to SARS-CoV-2, which started in China in December 2019, was announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. All epidemiological data so far show us that SARS-CoV-2 infection is less serious in children than in adults. Allergic asthma, the most common chronic disease in children, is usually not to be related to greater risk or severity for COVID-19 in pediatric populations. Although reports/research on asthma and COVID-19 in children have thus far been comforting, when coming across an asthma patient with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case Report. Here, we report a rare adolescent case of COVID-19-related pneumonia development with underlying asthma. A 16-year-old male patient has been followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of asthma for the last 5 years. He was thought to have typical clinical and laboratory findings for SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with underlying pediatric (allergic) asthma. Pulmonary CT showed findings consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia. He was discharged after 1 week when all his complaints regressed, his examination became normal, and 5-day favipiravir treatment was completed. Conclusion. When a physician comes across an asthma patient with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of favipiravir in patients with COVID-19
T2  - CPT-PHARMACOMETRICS & SYSTEMS PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The antiretroviral drug favipiravir (FPV) inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It has been developed for the treatment of the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, its pharmacokinetics in patients with COVID-19 is poorly understood. In this study, we measured FPV serum concentration by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and conducted population pharmacokinetic analysis. A total of 39 patients were enrolled in the study: 33 were administered FPV 1600 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) on the first day followed by 600 mg b.i.d., and 6 were administered FPV 1800 mg b.i.d. on the first day followed by 800 mg or 600 mg b.i.d. The median age was 68 years (range, 27-89 years), 31 (79.5%) patients were men, median body surface area (BSA) was 1.72 m(2) (range, 1.11-2.2 m(2)), and 10 (25.6%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at the start of FPV. A total of 204 serum concentrations were available for pharmacokinetic analysis. A one-compartment model with first-order elimination was used to describe the pharmacokinetics. The estimated mean clearance/bioavailability (CL/F) and distribution volume/bioavailability (V/F) were 5.11 L/h and 41.6 L, respectively. Covariate analysis revealed that CL/F was significantly related to dosage, IMV use, and BSA. A simulation study showed that the 1600 mg/600 mg b.i.d. regimen was insufficient for the treatment of COVID-19 targeting the 50% effective concentration (9.7 mu g/mL), especially in patients with larger BSA and/or IMV. A higher FPV dosage is required for COVID-19, but dose-dependent nonlinear pharmacokinetics may cause an unexpected significant pharmacokinetic change and drug toxicity. Further studies are warranted to explore the optimal FPV regimen.

TI  - Recent Advances on Nanotechnology-Based Strategies for Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Coronavirus Infections
T2  - JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is exponentially spreading across the world, leading to an outbreak of serious viral pneumonia. Antiviral therapies using chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and favipiravir have been approved by several countries to increase the quality of life of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Currently, several companies are intensively working on the production of coronavirus (CoV) vaccines, resulting in some specific vaccines that have been approved for CoV infections in humans. Nevertheless, efficient and specific prevention, treatment, and diagnosis are urgently required to combat the biological diversity and rapid mutation in CoV infections. Recently, significant attention has devoted to nanoformulation or nanoparticles (NPs) due to their specific features like high surface-to-volume ratio, drug encapsulation abilities, and specific optical properties to remove the complications of applied conventional therapeutic and diagnosis options. In this regard, NPs are increasingly used as new anti-CoV agents, vaccine carriers or adjuvants, and nanoscale biorecognition elements. The present review article provides a comprehensive discussion on the recent updates regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of different CoV infections with an emphasis on the application of NPs in vaccination, treatment, and diagnosis of CoV infections.

TI  - Longitudinal Analysis of Neutralizing Potency against SARS-CoV-2 in the Recovered Patients after Treatment with or without Favipiravir
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - The effect of treatment with favipiravir, an antiviral purine nucleoside analog, for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the production and duration of neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 was explored. There were 17 age-, gender-, and body mass index-matched pairs of favipiravir treated versus control selected from a total of 99 patients recovered from moderate COVID-19. These subjects participated in the longitudinal (>6 months) analysis of (i) SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's receptor-binding domain IgG, (ii) virus neutralization assay using authentic virus, and (iii) neutralization potency against original (WT) SARS-CoV-2 and cross-neutralization against B.1.351 (beta) variant carrying triple mutations of K417N, E484K, and N501Y. The results demonstrate that the use of favipiravir: (1) significantly accelerated the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 in the case vs. control groups (p = 0.027), (2) preserved the generation and persistence of neutralizing antibodies in the host, and (3) did not interfere the maturation of neutralizing potency of anti-SARS-CoV-2 and neutralizing breadth against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In conclusion, treatment of COVID-19 with favipiravir accelerates viral clearance and does not interfere the generation or maturation of neutralizing potency against both WT SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

TI  - Hypertriglyceridemia in Critically Ill Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection
T2  - ANNALS OF PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Background Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could develop severe disease requiring critical care admission. Case reports indicated high incidence of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, which might be related to the drugs. Objective We sought to determine the risk factors associated with HTG in this population and to investigate the relationship between HTG and lipase. Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted at our hospital between March 1 and June 30, 2020. Patients were included if they were >= 18 years old, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and had triglycerides (TG) checked during their hospital stay. Results Of the 111 critically ill patients, 103 patients were included. Males comprised 88.3% of the sample. The median TG at baseline was 197.4 (IQR: 139.8-283) mg/dL. The lipase median level at baseline was 23.00 (IQR: 0.00-69.50) IU/L. The results of the mixed-effects logistic regression analysis indicated that patient-level variables, favipiravir use, blood glucose level, and propofol use were significantly associated with HTG. There was no relationship between lipase and TG levels over time. Furthermore, TG concentrations over time showed a similar trend to inflammatory markers. Conclusion and Relevance The incidence of clinically significant HTG was high and was associated with propofol and favipiravir use. HTG might reflect the high inflammatory state in these patients. Clinicians should look at the full picture before changing therapies based only on HTG. Our findings need to be replicated in a larger prospective study.

TI  - COVID-19 Co-infection in a patient with Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever: A Case Report
T2  - MIKROBIYOLOJI BULTENI
AB  - Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is an acute viral zoonotic disease. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging viral disease and it is caused by "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)". In this article, a case diagnosed with CCHF and COVID-19 coinfection confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and its management was presented. A thirty-five years old female patient admitted to the hospital with the complaint of fever for one day and common body pain. It was learned that three days before the onset of her complaints, she removed a tick adhering to the anterior abdominal wall with no precaution. Her body temperature was 38 degrees C degrees and her respiratory rate was 22 per minute. The leucocyte count was 3660/mm(3) and the platelet count was 138.000/mm(3). It was determined that prothrombin time was 15.4 seconds, international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.35 seconds, and D-dimer level was 1310 ng/ml. The patient was hospitalized with prediagnosis of CCHF. Supportive treatment was started. On the second day at the clinical follow-up of the patient, complaints of sore throat and cough without sputum started. A combined nasopharyngeal and throat swab sample was taken from the patient because of the suspicion of COVID-19. COVID-19 PCR test result was reported as positive. Favipiravir treatment was started. The CCHF-PCR test, which was studied from the serum sample sent to the Microbiology Reference Laboratories was reported as positive. From the third day of favipiravir treatment; the patient did not have a fever and her complaints regressed. On the ninth day of her hospitalization, she was discharged. In this case; it is important to show that both diseases, especially in regions where CCHF disease is endemic, can be confused due to the similarity of the clinical picture with COVID-19 and to know that they can coexist.

TI  - Nucleosides and emerging viruses: A new story
T2  - DRUG DISCOVERY TODAY
AB  - With several US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and high barriers to resistance, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs remain the cornerstone of antiviral therapies for not only herpesviruses, but also HIV and hepatitis viruses (B and C); however, with the exception of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for which vaccines have been developed at unprecedented speed, there are no vaccines or small antivirals yet available for (re)emerging viruses, which are primarily RNA viruses. Thus, herein, we present an overview of ribonucleoside analogs recently developed and acting as inhibitors of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). They are new lead structures that will be exploited for the discovery of new antiviral nucleosides.

TI  - Safety Concerns Of Drugs And Vaccines Used In The Treatment Of COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL NEGATIVE RESULTS
AB  - The Novel Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic which is named as COVID-19 or '2019 n CoV ' or 2019 novel coronavirus by WHO is a highly contagious viral respiratory disease caused due to SARS- CoV-2. Various drugs used to treat this pandemic are Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Dexamethasone, etc. These drugs are effective, but they have also shown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during the treatment of COVID-19 and when an ADR arises due to their use, they add an additional level of complexity in the management of COVID-19 disease. This review aims to demonstrate the mechanism of action as well as the safety issues associated with the drugs used for COVID-19. It also focuses on the safety issues related with two vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and AstraZeneca, respectively. A comprehensive search in PubMed, Science direct, Drug bank, PubChem, CDC, WHO, FDA database was accomplished for research regarding ADR case reports associated with the drugs and vaccines for COVID-19.

TI  - An Overview of the Pathogenesis, Transmission, Diagnosis, and Management of Endemic Human Coronaviruses: A Reflection on the Past and Present Episodes and Possible Future Outbreaks
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic caught the world by surprise in late 2019 and has held it hostage for months with an increasing number of infections and deaths. Although coronavirus was first discovered in the 1960s and was known to cause respiratory infection in humans, no information was available about the epidemic pattern of the virus until the past two decades. This review addresses the pathogenesis, transmission dynamics, diagnosis, management strategies, the pattern of the past and present events, and the possibility of future outbreaks of the endemic human coronaviruses. Several studies have described bats as presumptive natural reservoirs of coronaviruses. In essence, the identification of a diverse group of similar SARS coronaviruses in bats suggests the possibility of a future epidemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-like) coronaviruses originating from different reservoir hosts. The study also identified a lack of vaccines to prevent human coronavirus infections in humans in the past, however, the recent breakthrough in vaccine discovery and approval for emergency use for the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is commendable. The high rates of genomic substitution and recombination due to errors in RNA replication and the potential for independent species crossing suggest the chances of an entirely new strain evolving. Therefore, rapid research efforts should be deployed for vaccination to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent a possible future outbreak. More sensitization and enlightenment on the need to adopt good personal hygiene practices, social distancing, and scientific evaluation of existing medications with promising antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 is required. In addition, intensive investigations to unravel and validate the possible reservoirs, the intermediate host, as well as insight into the ability of the virus to break the species barrier are needed to prevent future viral spillover and possible outbreaks.

TI  - Favipiravir tautomerism: a theoretical insight
T2  - THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY ACCOUNTS
AB  - There is no experimental information about the tautomerism of Favipiravir (T-705). Therefore, its tautomeric state was predicted by using density functional theory in gas phase and in solution (toluene, acetonitrile and water). The results have shown that, in neutral state, the enol form is strongly dominating in both gas phase and solution. The carboxamide group is easily protonated in the presence of acid, which leads to shift of the tautomeric equilibrium toward the keto tautomer. In order to validate the theoretical predictions, 2-hydroxy pyridine and 2-hydroxy pyrazine were also included in the set of studied compounds. The available experimental data about their tautomerism are in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions, which validate the conclusions made forT-705.

TI  - Recent Antiviral Treatment and Vaccination Strategies Against SARS-CoV-2
T2  - KLINISCHE MONATSBLATTER FUR AUGENHEILKUNDE
AB  - Since the end of 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading worldwide and has caused severe health and economic issues on a global scale. By the end of February 2021, more than 100 million SARS-CoV-2 cases had been reported worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be divided into three phases: An early phase with fever and cough (phase I), a pulmonary vascular disease (phase II) and a hyperinflammatory syndrome (phase III). Since viral replication plays a particularly important role in the early stage of the disease and the patient's immune system in the later course of infection, different therapeutic options arise depending on the stage of the disease. The antiviral nucleoside analogue remdesivir is the only antiviral compound with conditional approval in the European Union. Treatment with remdesivir should be initiated early (within the first seven days of symptom onset) in patients receiving supplemental oxygen without invasive ventilation. In turn, the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone should be administered later in the course of disease in patients receiving oxygen therapy. Since autopsies indicate an increased frequency of thromboembolic events due to COVID-19, additional treatment with anticoagulants is recommended. Since the development of novel antivirals may take years, the application of convalescent plasma from patients who recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection for the treatment of COVID-19 is reasonable. However, large-scale studies indicated low efficacy of convalescent plasma. Furthermore, vaccination of the population is essential to control the pandemic. Currently, the mRNA vaccine Tozinameran from BioNTech and Pfizer, the mRNA-1273 vaccine from Moderna as well as the vector vaccine AZD1222 from AstraZeneca are licensed in the European Union. All three vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy in large clinical trials. In addition to these licensed vaccines, many others are being tested in clinical trials. In the present article, an overview of therapeutic options for COVID-19 as well as vaccines for protection against SARS-CoV-2 is provided.

TI  - In silico Investigation on the Inhibiting Role of Nicotine/Caffeine by Blocking the S Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Versus ACE2 Receptor
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - In this paper, we studied the in silico interaction of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) human receptor with two bioactive compounds, i.e., nicotine and caffeine, via molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The simulations reveal the efficient blocking of ACE2 by caffeine and nicotine in the exposure to the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have selected the two most important active sites of ACE2-S protein, i.e., 6LZG and 6VW1, which are critically responsible in the interaction of S protein to the receptor and thus, we investigated their interaction with nicotine and caffeine through MD simulations. Caffeine and nicotine are interesting structures for interactions because of their similar structure to the candidate antiviral drugs. Our results reveal that caffeine or nicotine in a specific molar ratio to 6LZG shows a very strong interaction and indicate that caffeine is more efficient in the interaction with 6LZG and further blocking of this site against S protein binding. Further, we investigated the interaction of ACE2 receptor- S protein with nicotine or caffeine when mixed with candidate or approved antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 therapy. Our MD simulations suggest that the combination of caffeine with ribavirin shows a stronger interaction with 6VW1, while in case of favipiravir+nicotine, 6LZG shows potent efficacy of these interaction, proposing the potent efficacy of these combinations for blocking ACE2 receptor against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Current Potential Therapeutic Approaches against SARS-CoV-2: A Review
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
AB  - The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a serious threat to public health worldwide and, to date, no effective treatment is available. Thus, we herein review the pharmaceutical approaches to SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment. Numerous candidate medicines that can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication have been proposed. These medicines include inhibitors of serine protease TMPRSS2 and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the receptor in host cells. ACE2 inhibitors block TMPRSS2 and S protein priming, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells. Moreover, antiviral medicines (including the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, the HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, and wide-spectrum antiviral antibiotics arbidol and favipiravir) have been shown to reduce the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 as well as morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.

TI  - Synthetic Attempts Towards Eminent Anti-viral Candidates of SARS-CoV
T2  - MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) aka SARS-CoV spread over southern China for the first time in 2002-2003 and history repeated again since last year and took away lives of more than two million people so far. On March 11, 2020 COVID-19 outbreak was officially declared as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). The entire world united to fight back against this ultimate destruction. Around 90 vaccines are featured against SARS-CoV-2 and more than 300 active clinical trials are underway by several groups and individuals. So far, no drugs have been currently approved that can completely eliminate the deadly coronavirus. The promising SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs are favipiravir, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and avifavir. In this review, we have discussed the synthetic approaches elaborately made so far by different groups and chemical companies all around the world towards top three convincing anti-viral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, which are favipiravir, remdesivir and lopinavir.

TI  - Establishment of a stable SARS-CoV-2 replicon system for application in high-throughput screening
T2  - ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH
AB  - Experiments with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are limited by the need for biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions. A SARS-CoV-2 replicon system rather than an in vitro infection system is suitable for antiviral screening since it can be handled under BSL2 conditions and does not produce infectious particles. However, the reported replicon systems are cumbersome because of the need for transient transfection in each assay. In this study, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome vector (the replicon-BAC vector) including the SARS-CoV-2 replicon and a fusion gene encoding Renilla luciferase and neomycin phospho-transferase II, examined the antiviral effects of several known compounds, and then established a cell line stably harboring the replicon-BAC vector. Several cell lines transiently transfected with the replicon-BAC vector pro-duced subgenomic replicon RNAs (sgRNAs) and viral proteins, and exhibited luciferase activity. In the transient replicon system, treatment with remdesivir or interferon-beta but not with camostat or favipiravir suppressed the production of viral agents and luciferase, indicating that luciferase activity corresponds to viral replication. VeroE6/Rep3, a stable replicon cell line based on VeroE6 cells, was successfully established and continuously produced viral proteins, sgRNAs and luciferase, and their production was suppressed by treatment with remdesivir or interferon-beta. Molnupiravir, a novel coronavirus RdRp inhibitor, inhibited viral replication more potently in VeroE6/Rep3 cells than in VeroE6-based transient replicon cells. In summary, our stable replicon system will be a powerful tool for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals through high-throughput screening.

TI  - Nano-therapeutic strategies to target coronavirus
T2  - VIEW
AB  - The coronaviruses have caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the more recent coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). The global COVID-19 pandemic requires urgent action to develop anti-virals, new therapeutics, and vaccines. In this review, we discuss potential therapeutics including human recombinant ACE2 soluble, inflammatory cytokine inhibitors, and direct anti-viral agents such as remdesivir and favipiravir, to limit their fatality. We also discuss the structure of the SARS-CoV-2, which is crucial to the timely development of therapeutics, and previous attempts to generate vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Finally, we provide an overview of the role of nanotechnology in the development of therapeutics as well as in the diagnosis of the infection. This information is key for computational modeling and nanomedicine-based new therapeutics by counteracting the variable proteins in the virus. Further, we also try to effectively share the latest information about many different aspects of COVID-19 vaccine developments and possible management to further scientific endeavors.

TI  - Favipiravir for treating patients with novel coronavirus (COVID-19): protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China, in mid-December 2019, and declared a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. Due to the unknown nature of the disease and the lack of specific drugs, several potential treatments were used for patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate studies of the effects of favipiravir in COVID-19 pneumonia.
   Methods and analysis We will search electronic databases including LitCovid hub, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Sciences, Cochrane and Embase using keywords related to COVID-19 and favipiravir. We will search the reference lists of all included studies and reviews. We will also search for clinical trial registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, for the ongoing clinical trials. All randomised clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of favipiravir compared with other control groups for the treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 will be included. Patients' survival at the end of the treatment as well as the follow-up will be the primary outcome of the treatment, followed by the time and rate of the patient with a negative COVID-19 test. The desired secondary outcome will consist of a decreased rate of symptoms, proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) transfers, length of the hospital stay, ICU treatments, the quality of life and additional adverse events. Data synthesis will be conducted using CMA V.2. Two independent investigators will be screening titles, abstracts and full texts of included studies, based on eligibility criteria. These investigators will then independently extract the data and appraise the quality of said studies. All potential discrepancies will be resolved through consultation with the third reviewer. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard I-2 test. A funnel plot, Egger's test and Begg's test will be used for detecting asymmetry to explore possible publication bias.
   Ethics and dissemination All findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis will help identify the safety and efficacy of favipiravir for patients with COVID-19. Given that the design of the study is a systematic review, there is no need to follow the code of ethics protocol. The results of this study will be published in a reputable journal.

TI  - DFT and MD simulation investigation of favipiravir as an emerging antiviral option against viral protease (3CL (pro )) of SARS-CoV-2
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB  - As per date, around 20 million COVID-19 cases reported from across the globe due to a tiny 125 nm sized virus: SARS-CoV-2 which has created a pandemic and left an unforgettable impact on our world. Besides vaccine, medical community is in a race to identify an effective drug, which can fight against this disease effectively. Favipiravir ( F ) has recently attracted too much attention as an effective repurposed drug against COVID-19. In the present study, the pertinency of F has been tested as an antiviral option against viral protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 with the help of density functional theory (DFT) and MD Simulation. Different electronic properties of F such as atomic charges, molecular electrostatic properties (MEP), chemical reactivity and absorption analysis have been studied by DFT. In order to understand the interaction and stability of inhibitor F against viral protease, molecular docking and MD simulation have been performed. Various output like interaction energies, number of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, binding energy etc. have established the elucidate role of F for the management of CoV-2 virus for which there is no approved therapies till now. Our findings highlighted the need to further evaluate F as a potential antiviral against SARS-CoV-2. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soot-Based Reduced Graphene Quantum Dot/Hemin Conjugate for Favipiravir Sensing
T2  - ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB  - A conjugated system was synthesized from reduced graphene quantum dot (rGQD) and hemin for the selective detection of favipiravir (Fav), an antiviral drug that has come into much attention during the year 2020 for its use as a drug against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The required rGQD was prepared from soot particles using Hummers' method followed by the amino-hydrothermal process. At the first step, its fluorescence was quenched by preparing the conjugate with hemin. Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity gradually increases (turn-on) with increasing concentration of Fav, and develops 9-fold higher fluorescence at 15.6 nM of Fay. The fluorescence enhancement is selective, and the limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be about 1.96 nM. The fluorescence turnon is governed by aggregation-induced emission (ME), which originates from electrostatic interactions between the sensor-analyte systems. A similar fluorescence turn-on was observed for Fav in human blood plasma (BP) as well as in artificial urine (AU), which indicates that the sensor is viable in real-sample analysis. In addition to Fav, its 1:1 cocrystals with theophylline (Theo) and ferulic acid (FRA) also enhance the fluorescence in real samples with an LOD of 3.47 and 12.2 nM, respectively. Therefore, the cocrystals remain intact in biological medium and the sensor interacts with cocrystals too. The detection of Fav and its cocrystals, and the development of cocrystals as alternatives in the pharmaceutical industry, is essential considering the current COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. Therefore, the findings of this work will certainly help in developing fluorescence sensors for quantitative determination of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in real samples.

TI  - Early diagnosis by antigen test kit and early treatment by antiviral therapy: An ambulatory management strategy during COVID-19 crisis in Thailand
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of patients who registered at the Siriraj Favipiravir Clinic and to share our experiences in this comparatively unique clinical setting. This retrospective study included patients who registered at the Siriraj Favipiravir Clinic during August 11, 2021 to September 14, 2021. Included adult patients were those with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) infection confirmed by antigen test kit (ATK) or real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, no favipiravir contraindication, no prior COVID-19 treatment, and not receiving care from another medical facility. Demographic data and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Of the 1168 patients (mean age: 44.8 +/- 16.4 years, 55.7% female) who registered at the clinic, 117 (10%) did not meet the treatment criteria, and 141 (12%) patients did not pick up their medication. One-third of patients had at least 1 symptom that indicated severe disease. Higher proportion of unvaccinated status (56.7% vs 47.5%, P = .005), higher proportion of persons with risk factors for disease progression (37.7% vs 31.3%, P = .028), and longer duration between the date of clinic registration and the date of positive diagnostic test (3 vs 2 days, P = .004) were significantly more commonly observed in the severe disease group compared to the nonsevere disease group. The duration between symptom onset and the date of clinic registration was significantly longer in the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction group than in the ATK group (6 vs 4 days, P < .001). Most patients (90.0%) had completed favipiravir treatment regimen. The improvement and mortality rates were 86.7% and 1.2%, respectively. COVID-19 severity is associated with vaccination status, baseline risk factors, and timing between disease detection and treatment. The use of ATK influences patients to seek treatment significantly earlier in ambulatory setting. Our early diagnosis and antiviral treatment strategy yielded favorable results in an outpatient setting during a COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand.

TI  - Salmonella Bacteremia Accompanying COVID-19: The First Salmonella Co-Infection in the World Unrelated to Pakistan
T2  - MIKROBIYOLOJI BULTENI
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection emerged in China at the end of 2019 and caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The lymphopenia seen in COVID-19 increases the incidence of susceptibility to other microorganisms and may cause co-infections. As the signs and symptoms of the diseases overlap with other infectious diseases and due to the intensity in health services, the diagnosis of co-infections becomes difficult and the treatment may be delayed. Therefore, infections accompanying COVID-19 cause an increase in morbidity and mortality.The isolation and quarantine measures taken during the COVID-19 process have reduced the number of infections transmitted from person to person. However, there was no significant decrease in diseases transmitted by food, such as salmonellosis. During the pandemic, salmonellosis continued to be a problem, especially in endemic areas such as Pakistan, and an increase in Salmonella infections associated with backyard poultry has been reported in countries such as the United States. A co-infection of COVID-19 and enteric fever associated with travel to Pakistan was reported for the first time in the literature in February 2021. In this case report, the first co-infection of COVID-19 and Salmonella in our country was presented. A 56-year-old male patient with no known systemic disease was admitted to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, weakness and myalgia lasting for three days. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test was positive. The patient has been hospitalized and favipiravir, moxifloxacin, and methylprednisolone were started. Blood cultures were taken from the patient whose clinical picture worsened and fever continued despite of the medical treatment. Salmonella enterica spp. enterica was isolated and ceftriaxone treatment was started. The patient's anamnesis was deepened, but no diarrhea, abdominal pain, suspicious food consumption, travel history were determined. From the second day of the ceftriaxone treatment, the patient's fever decreased and no growth was detected in the control blood cultures. Ceftriaxone treatment was completed in 14 days and the patient was discharged on the 28th day. Approximately 87-95% of Salmonella strains isolated in our country are S.enterica spp. enterica, and S.enterica spp. enterica was also isolated in our case. Salmonella infections most commonly present as gastroenteritis, but the risk of bacteremia increases in case of immunosuppression. Although there was no additional disease in our case, it was considered that the infection in the form of bacteremia occurred due to an immunosuppression caused by COVID-19. In this context; drawing blood cultures of patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 is very important in terms of detecting co-infections and superinfections, and administering appropriate antibiotic therapy at appropriate treatment times. Presentation of first case of Salmonella bacteremia and simultaneous COVID-19 infection in our country was the strong side of our report. In addition, our case is also important as being the first SARS-CoV-2 and Salmonella co-infection unrelated to Pakistan in the literature.
   The limitation of our case was that S.enterica spp. enterica detected in the blood culture could not be subtyped and the stool culture could not be examined. However, this does not constitute a diagnostic requirement. In addition, the patient's pre-COVID-19 Salmonella carrier status was also unknown. As a result, patients become vulnerable to other infections due to the lymphopenia seen in COVID-19. Therefore, Salmonella bacteremia can be seen with SARS-CoV-2 infection without a comorbid condition. Drawing blood cultures in hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 is very important in terms of detecting concomitant infections in a short time. In patients whose clinical condition does not improve and fever continues despite of treatment, blood cultures should be taken, especially in the case of an advanced immunosuppresive treatment plan, and it should always be kept in mind that secondary infections and co-infections may occur.

TI  - Uric Acid Elevation by Favipiravir, an Antiviral Drug
T2  - TOHOKU JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - In light of the recent pandemic, favipiravir (Avigan (R)), a purine nucleic acid analog and antiviral agent approved for use in influenza in Japan, is being studied for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Increase in blood uric acid level is a frequent side effect of favipiravir. Here, we discussed the mechanism of blood uric acid elevation during favipiravir treatment. Favipiravir is metabolized to an inactive metabolite M1 by aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase, and excreted into urine. In the kidney, uric acid handling is regulated by the balance of reabsorption and tubular secretion in the proximal tubules. Favipiravir and M1 act as moderate inhibitors of organic anion transporter 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3), which are involved in uric acid excretion in the kidney. In addition, M1 enhances uric acid reuptake via urate transporter 1 (URAT1) in the renal proximal tubules. Thus, favipiravir is thought to decrease uric acid excretion into urine, resulting in elevation of uric acid levels in blood. Elevated uric acid levels were returned to normal after discontinuation of favipiravir, and favipiravir is not used for long periods of time for the treatment of viral infection. Thus, the effect on blood uric acid levels was subclinical in most studies. Nevertheless, the adverse effect of favipiravir might be clinically important in patients with a history of gout, hyperuricemia, kidney function impairment (in which blood concentration of M1 increases), and where there is concomitant use of other drugs affecting blood uric acid elevation.

TI  - Interhospital transportation of a COVID-19 patient undergoing veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation by helicopter
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients develop rapidly progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome and require veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). A previous study recommended the transfer of ECMO patients to ECMO centers. However, because of the pandemic, a limited number of ECMO centers are available for patient transfer. The safe long-distance interhospital transport of these patients is a concern. To minimize transportation time, helicopter use is a suitable choice. We report the first case of a COVID-19 patient on V-V ECMO, transferred to our ECMO center by helicopter.
   A 45-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis history, treated with immunosuppressants, presented with fever and sore throat. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 following a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction test result and was subsequently prescribed favipiravir. However, his respiratory failure progressively worsened. On day 10 of hospitalization at the previous hospital, he was intubated, and we received a request for ECMO transport on the next day. The ECMO team, who wore personal protective equipment (N95 respirators, gloves, gowns, and face shields), initiated V-V ECMO in the referring hospital and safely transported the patient by helicopter. The flight time was 7 min. He was admitted to the intensive care unit of our hospital and received tocilizumab. He was discharged on hospital day 31 with no significant sequelae. In this case report, we discuss important factors for the safe and appropriate interhospital transportation of COVID-19 patients on ECMO as well as staff and patient safety during helicopter transportation.

TI  - Druggable targets and therapeutic development for COVID-19
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY
AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, is the biggest challenge to the global public health and economy in recent years. Until now, only limited therapeutic regimens have been available for COVID-19 patients, sparking unprecedented efforts to study coronavirus biology. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes 16 non-structural, four structural, and nine accessory proteins, which mediate the viral life cycle, including viral entry, RNA replication and transcription, virion assembly and release. These processes depend on the interactions between viral polypeptides and host proteins, both of which could be potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19. Here, we will discuss the potential medicinal value of essential proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and key host factors. We summarize the most updated therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 patients, including those approved clinically or in clinical trials.

TI  - Review of adverse cutaneous reactions of pharmacologic interventions for COVID-19: A guide for the dermatologist
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
AB  - The new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is associated with a wide variety of cutaneous manifestations. Although new skin manifestations caused by COVID-19 are continuously being described, other cutaneous entities should also be considered in the differential diagnosis, including adverse cutaneous reactions to drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 infections. The aim of this review is to provide dermatologists with an overview of the cutaneous adverse effects associated with the most frequently prescribed drugs in patients with COVID-19. The skin reactions of antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin with or without interferon, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and darunavir), and treatments for complications (imatinib, tocilizumab, anakinra, immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, colchicine and low molecular weight heparins) are analyzed. Information regarding possible skin reactions, their frequency, management, and key points for differential diagnosis are presented.

TI  - Marine algal antagonists targeting 3CL protease and spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2: a computational approach for anti-COVID-19 drug discovery
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has severely destructed human life worldwide, with no suitable treatment until now. SARS-CoV-2 virus is unprecedented, resistance against number of therapeutics and spreading rapidly with high mortality, which warrants the need to discover new effective drugs to combat this situation. This current study is undertaken to explore the antiviral potential of marine algal compounds to inhibit the viral entry and its multiplication using computational analysis. Among the proven drug discovery targets of SARS-CoV-2, spike glycoprotein and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease are responsible for the virus attachment and viral genome replication in the host cell. In this study, the above-mentioned drug targets were docked with marine algal compounds (sulfated polysaccharides, polysaccharide derivatives and polyphenols) using molecular docking tools (AutoDockTools). The obtained results indicate that kappa-carrageenan, laminarin, eckol, trifucol and beta-D-galactose are the top-ranking compounds showing better docking scores with SARS-CoV-2 targets, than the current experimental COVID-19 antiviral drugs like dexamethasone, remdesivir, favipiravir and MIV-150. Further, molecular dynamic simulation, ADMET and density functional theory calculations were evaluated to substantiate the findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on in silico analysis of aforesaid algal metabolites against SARS-CoV-2 targets.

TI  - Molecular Binding Mechanism and Pharmacology Comparative Analysis of Noscapine for Repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 Protease
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
AB  - Originating in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019, COVID-19 has emerged now as a global health emergency with a high number of deaths worldwide. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in pandemic conditions around the globe. We are in the battleground to fight against the virus by rapidly developing therapeutic strategies in tackling SARS-CoV-2 and saving human lives from COVID-19. Scientists are evaluating several known drugs either for the pathogen or the host; however, many of them are reported to be associated with side effects. In the present study, we report the molecular binding mechanisms of the natural alkaloid, noscapine, for repurposing against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, a key enzyme involved in its reproduction. We performed the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in an explicit solvent to investigate the molecular mechanisms of noscapine for stable binding and conformational changes to the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. The drug repurposing study revealed the high potential of noscapine and proximal binding to the Mpro enzyme in a comparative binding pattern analyzed with chloroquine, ribavirin, and favipiravir. Noscapine binds dosely to binding pocket-3 of the Mpro enzyme and depicted stable binding with RMSD 0.1-1.9 angstrom and RMSF profile peak conformational fluctuations at 202-306 residues, and a Rg score ranging from 21.9 to 22.4 angstrom. The MM/PB (GB) SA calculation landscape revealed the most significant contribution in terms of binding energy with Delta PB -19.08 and Delta GB -27.17 kcal/mol. The electrostatic energy distribution in MM energy was obtained to be -71.16 kcal/mol and depicted high free energy decomposition (electrostatic energy) at 155-306 residues (binding pocket-3) of Mpro by a MM force field. Moreover, the dynamical residue cross-correlation map also stated that the high pairwise correlation occurred at binding residues 200-306 of the Mpro enzyme (binding pocket-3) with noscapine. Principal component analysis depicted the enhanced movement of protein atoms with a high number of static hydrogen bonds. The obtained binding results of noscapine were also well correlated with the pharmacokinetic parameters of antiviral drugs.

TI  - Nucleoside Analogs and Nucleoside Precursors as Drugs in the Fight against SARS-CoV-2 and Other Coronaviruses
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA enveloped viruses, members of the family Coronaviridae, that cause infections in a broad range of mammals including humans. Several CoV species lead to mild upper respiratory infections typically associated with common colds. However, three human CoV (HCoV) species: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, are responsible for severe respiratory diseases at the origin of two recent epidemics (SARS and MERS), and of the current COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19), respectively. The easily transmissible SARS-CoV-2, emerging at the end of 2019 in China, spread rapidly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 a pandemic. While the world waits for mass vaccination, there is an urgent need for effective drugs as short-term weapons to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context, the drug repurposing approach is a strategy able to guarantee positive results rapidly. In this regard, it is well known that several nucleoside-mimicking analogs and nucleoside precursors may inhibit the growth of viruses providing effective therapies for several viral diseases, including HCoV infections. Therefore, this review will focus on synthetic nucleosides and nucleoside precursors active against different HCoV species, paying great attention to SARS-CoV-2. This work covers progress made in anti-CoV therapy with nucleoside derivatives and provides insight into their main mechanisms of action.

TI  - Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics Studies of SARS-CoV-2 Inhibitors: Crocin, Digitoxigenin, Beta-Eudesmol and Favipiravir: Comparative Study
T2  - BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH IN APPLIED CHEMISTRY
AB  - In this study, Crocin, Digitoxigenin, Beta-Eudesmol, and Favipiravir were docked in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB code: 6LU7). The docking study was followed by Molecular Dynamics simulation. The result indicates that Crocin and Digitoxigenin are the structures with the best affinity in the studied enzyme's binding site. Still, Molecular Dynamics simulation showed that Digitoxigenin is the molecule that fits better in the active site of the main protease. Therefore, this molecule could have a more potent antiviral treatment of COVID-19 than the other three studied compounds.

TI  - Remdesivir overcomes the S861 roadblock in SARS-CoV-2 polymerase elongation complex
T2  - CELL REPORTS
AB  - Remdesivir (RDV), a nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum features, has exhibited effectiveness in COVID19 treatment. However, the precise working mechanism of RDV when targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) has not been fully elucidated. Here, we solve a 3.0-A structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RdRP elongation complex (EC) and assess RDV intervention in polymerase elongation phase. Although RDV could induce an "i+3"delayed termination in meta-stable complexes, only pausing and subsequent elongation are observed in the EC. A comparative investigation using an enterovirus RdRP further confirms similar delayed intervention and demonstrates that steric hindrance of the RDV-characteristic 1'-cyano at the -4 position is responsible for the "i+3"intervention, although two representative Flaviviridae RdRPs do not exhibit similar behavior. A comparison of representative viral RdRP catalytic complex structures indicates that the product RNA backbone encounters highly conserved structural elements, highlighting the broad-spectrum intervention potential of 10-modified nucleotide analogs in anti-RNA virus drug development.

TI  - Virtual and In Vitro Antiviral Screening Revive Therapeutic Drugs for COVID-19
T2  - ACS PHARMACOLOGY & TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE
AB  - The urgent need for a cure for early phase COVID-19 infected patients critically underlines drug repositioning strategies able to efficiently identify new and reliable treatments by merging computational, experimental, and pharmacokinetic expertise. Here we report new potential therapeutics for COVID-19 identified with a combined virtual and experimental screening strategy and selected among already approved drugs. We used hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), one of the most studied drugs in current clinical trials, as a reference template to screen for structural similarity against a library of almost 4000 approved drugs. The top-ranked drugs, based on structural similarity to HCQ, were selected for in vitro antiviral assessment. Among the selected drugs, both zuclopenthixol and nebivolol efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection with EC50 values in the low micromolar range, as confirmed by independent experiments. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of ambroxol, amodiaquine, and its active metabolite (N-monodesethyl amodiaquine) is also discussed. In trying to understand the "hydroxychloroquine" mechanism of action, both pKa and the HCQ aromatic core may play a role. Further, we show that the amodiaquine metabolite and, to a lesser extent, zuclopenthixol and nebivolol are active in a SARS-CoV-2 titer reduction assay. Given the need for improved efficacy and safety, we propose zuclopenthixol, nebivolol, and amodiaquine as potential candidates for clinical trials against the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss their potential use as adjuvant to the current (i.e., remdesivir and favipiravir) COVID-19 therapeutics.

TI  - Disease-drug and drug-drug interaction in COVID-19: Risk and assessment
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - COVID-19 is announced as a global pandemic in 2020. Its mortality and morbidity rate are rapidly increasing, with limited medications. The emergent outbreak of COVID-19 prompted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps spreading. In this infection, a patient's immune response plays pivotal role in the pathogenesis. This inflammatory factor was shown by its mediators that, in severe cases, reach the cytokine at peaks. Hyperinflammatory state may sparks significant imbalances in transporters and drug metabolic machinery, and subsequent alteration of drug pharmacokinetics may result in unexpected therapeutic response. The present scenario has accounted for the requirement for therapeutic opportunities to relive and overcome this pandemic. Despite the diminishing developments of COVID-19, there is no drug still approved to have significant effects with no side effect on the treatment for COVID-19 patients. Based on the evidence, many antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs have been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the COVID19 patients even though not knowing the possible drug-drug interactions (DDI). Remdesivir, favipiravir, and molnupiravir are deemed the most hopeful antiviral agents by improving infected patient's health. Dexamethasone is the first known steroid medicine that saved the lives of seriously ill patients. Some oligopeptides and proteins have also been using. The current review summarizes medication updates to treat COVID-19 patients in an inflammatory state and their interaction with drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes. It gives an opinion on the potential DDI that may permit the individualization of these drugs, thereby enhancing the safety and efficacy.

TI  - Psychopharmacology of COVID-19
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATICS
AB  - Background: With the rapid, global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, hospitals have become inundated with patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019. Consultation-liaison psychiatrists are actively involved in managing these patients and should familiarize themselves with how the virus and its proposed treatments can affect psychotropic management. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug to treat COVID-19 is remdesivir, and other off-label medications used include chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, convalescent plasma therapy, azithromycin, vitamin C, corticosteroids, interferon, and colchicine. Objective: To provide an overview of the major safety considerations relevant to clinicians who prescribe psychotropics to patients with COVID-19, both related to the illness and its proposed treatments. Methods: In this targeted review, we performed structured literature searches in PubMed to identify articles describing the impacts of COVID-19 on different organ systems, the neuropsychiatric adverse effects of treatments, and any potential drug interactions with psychotropics. The articles most relevant to this one were included. Results: COVID-19 impacts multiple organ systems, including gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological, and hematological systems. This may lead to pharmacokinetic changes that impact psychotropic medications and increase sensitivity to psychotropic-related adverse effects. In addition, several proposed treatments for COVID-19 have neuropsychiatric effects and potential interactions with commonly used psychotropics. Conclusions: Clinicians should be aware of the need to adjust existing psychotropics or avoid using certain medications in some patients with COVID- 19. They should also be familiar with neuropsychiatric effects of medications being used to treat this disease. Further research is needed to identify strategies to manage psychiatric issues in this population.

TI  - Repurposing of histone deacetylase inhibitors: A promising strategy to combat pulmonary fibrosis promoted by TGF-beta signalling in COVID-19 survivors
T2  - LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread around the world causing global public health emergency. In the last twenty years, we have witnessed several viral epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and most recently Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). There were tremendous efforts endeavoured globally by scientists to combat these viral diseases and now for SARS-CoV-2. Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir and dexamethasone are adopted for use against COVID-19 and currently clinical studies are underway to test their safety and efficacy for treating COVID-19 patients. As per World Health Organization reports, so far more than 16 million people are affected by COVID-19 with a recovery of close to 10 million and deaths at 600,000 globally.
   SARS-CoV-2 infection is reported to cause extensive pulmonary damages in affected people. Given the large number of recoveries, it is important to follow-up the recovered patients for apparent lung function abnormalities. In this review, we discuss our understanding about the development of long-term pulmonary abnormalities such as lung fibrosis observed in patients recovered from coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and probable epigenetic therapeutic strategy to prevent the development of similar pulmonary abnormalities in SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients. In this regard, we address the use of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors therapy to manage pulmonary fibrosis and their underlying molecular mechanisms in managing the pathologic processes in COVID-19 recovered patients.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - The new virus of the of beta-Coronaviruses genus, SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and is winning a proverbial chess match against all players simultaneous, including physicians, clinicians, pathologists, doctors, scientists, economists, athletes and politicians. The COVID-19 outbreak has seriously threatened public health, killing the most vulnerable persons and causing general panic. To stop this disease, effective remedies (i.e., drugs, vaccines, personal protection elements, etc.) are urgently required. Unfortunately, no registered specific therapies (including antiviral therapies, immune-modulating agents and vaccines) are currently available to treat coronavirus infections, highlighting an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. In this work, fourteen existing small molecule drugs or/and experimental drugs selected by experts and examined from the point of view of bioavailability via the Lipinski-Veber rules and assessment of their physicochemical descriptors. The aim of this study is to discover selected pattern similarities and peculiar characteristics that could be useful for antiviral drug optimization, drug combination or new antiviral agent design.

TI  - Glossary of phytoconstituents: Can these be repurposed against SARS CoV-2? A quick in silico screening of various phytoconstituents from plant Glycyrrhiza glabra with SARS CoV-2 main protease
T2  - FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB  - World is familiar with the viral pathogen Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). The principle working enzymes of SARS CoV-2 have been identified as main proteases 3Cl pro which act as main regulators for SARS infection. The need for therapy is required immediately pertaining to the vulnerable conditions. Protein-ligand studies are imperative for understanding the functioning of biological interactions as they are crucial in providing a hypothetical origin for the design and unearthing of novel drug targets. Phytoconstituents from Glycyrrhiza glabra, earlier reported to be anticancerous in nature were used as repurposed drugs against SARS CoV-2 main protease 3Clpro. We analyzed the molecular interactions of protein-phytocompounds, by AutoDock Vina 4.2 tools. The best interactions of each algorithm were subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to have an insight of the molecular dynamic mechanisms involved. Selected phytoconstituents gave a good score for binding affinity with the main protease 6LU7 of SARS CoV-2 as compared to the antiviral drugs already being used in the disease therapy. DehydroglyasperinC(-8.7,-8.1,-6.7,-7.1)kcal/mol, Licochalcone D (-8.4,-8.2,-7.1,-7.9) kcal/mol, Liquiritin(-8.6,-9.0,-7.2,-7.8) kcal/mol have showed energy interactions with 3Clpro better than many FDA approved repurposed drugs; Remdesvir, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine. MD Simulation also corelates our findings for molecular docking studies.

TI  - The long-quarantined case of COVID-19 with prolonged viral shedding and intermittent fever for more than 70 days
T2  - FUTURE VIROLOGY
AB  - A 79-year old Japanese woman was diagnosed with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), based on a positive reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) test result. Chest computed tomography revealed mild interstitial pneumonia. She had intermittent persistent inflammatory reactions with fever. Laboratory findings and RT-PCR test results showed SARS-CoV-2 positivity for more than 70 days. To the best of our knowledge, this relatively mild case has the longest duration of viral shedding recorded, as confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. This case demonstrates that the viral shedding in COVID-19 can be prolonged, even in mild disease, and highlights the difficulties in distinguishing viral shedding from SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FLUORESCENCE
AB  - We hereby introduce a sensitive fast straightforward spectrofluorometric method for the estimation of remdesivir and favipiravir. The two drugs are prescribed in some regimens to treat COVID-19 pandemic disease, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2. The method is based on the first derivative synchronous spectrofluorimetry approach for the measurement of remdesivir and favipiravir. This was accomplished at 251 nm and 335 nm respectively using the first derivative order at delta lambda of 140 nm. A linear response with a correlation coefficient 0.9994 was achieved between the concentration and the derivative amplitudes in the ranges of 20.0-100.0 ng ml(-1) and 40.0-100.0 ng ml(-1) for remdesivir and favipiravir, respectively. The methods were validated for different parameters as stated by the pharmacopeial rules and were applied successfully for estimation of the studied drugs in their synthetic mixtures and in spiked human plasma samples. No significant difference was observed between the proposed and comparison methods as revealed from the analysis of data.

TI  - Comprehensive review on repurposing of approved medicine in the management of COVID-19 infection
T2  - ORGANIC COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus, accountable for the COVID-19 pandemic, is now sweeping the globe. As a result, as this disease resists testing and adoption of new treatments, repositioning existing medications may provide a quick and appealing method with established safety, features, and dose used. They are not, however, specific or focused. However, numerous medications have been studied for their efficacy and safety in treatment of COVID-19, with the majority currently undergoing clinical trials. The goal is to rapidly expand novel preventative and therapeutic medications, as well as to apply preventive methods such as early patient identification, isolation, and treatment. Moreover, reducing transmission through physical contact is also important. In the fight against this dangerous disease, finding the proper treatment is crucial. This article summarizes several anti-malarial, anti-parasitic, monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressant, and immunomodulating agents in clinical trials for COVID-19. The purpose of this article is to evaluate and explore the potential roles of several medications now utilized in COVID-19.

TI  - Perspectives for antivirals to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19)
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY AUSTRALIA
AB  - Compared with vaccines, antivirals for curbing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) have been developed at a much lower pace. Favipiravir has proven efficacious (in hamsters) but only at a very high dose which may not be feasible in humans. Remdesivir is the sole antiviral approved by the US FDA, but it has not been extensively evaluated for its safety. EIDD-1931 and EIDD-2801 have not been evaluated clinically. M-pro (protease) inhibitors likewise need to be subjected to clinical efficacy and safety studies. Remdesivir is a C-nucleoside and this class of compounds should be further evaluated. Polyanionic substances interfering with virus adsorption to the host cells have not been explored. They may possibly be administered by inhalation. Corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone), while virus-stimulating rather than inhibitory, may counteract the 'cytokine storm'. Combination of (two or more of) the compounds mentioned above may offer an increased benefit through a synergistic interaction.

TI  - Evidence of the Clinical Efficacy of Antiviral Agents against SARS-CoV-2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND ALLIED SCIENCES
AB  - The highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, typically induces atypical pneumonia in humans by replicating in the lower and upper respiratory tract. It may also infect gastrointestinal and cardiovascular tissue, where its key binding receptor, ACE2 is located. Numerous treatment strategies have been investigated and repurposed to mitigate the potentially serious clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet there is currently no definitive treatment for this disease. This literature review examined the published clinical evidence of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug efficacy in terms of reducing viral load, recovery time, hospitalization time, mechanical ventilation, and case fatality rates in COVID-19 patients. It was found that remdesivir, the FDA-approved antiviral for severe illness, shows suboptimal efficacy, that neutralizing antibodies including bamlanivimab/etesevimab, casirivimab/imdevimab, and CT-P59 demonstrate clinical efficacy, particularly in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and curbing hospitalization and death, and that antivirals such as favipiravir, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, and nitazoxanide may harbor potential efficacy. Nafamostat-mesylate and novaferon require further investigation to validate promising early findings. In conclusion, definitive treatments of COVID-19 remain elusive, but numerous antiviral strategies including remdesivir and neutralizing antibodies may temper COVID-19. Prevention of COVID-19 may be achieved by vaccination, but only a small proportion of the global population is inoculated. Therefore, ongoing research on anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment is required.

TI  - Efficacy of the use of mefenamic acid combined with standard medical care vs. standard medical care alone for the treatment of COVID-19: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE
AB  - Mefenamic acid is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug exhibiting a wide range of anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and probable antiviral activities. The present study evaluated the efficacy of treatment with mefenamic acid combined with standard medical care vs. standard medical care plus a placebo in ambulatory patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; nasal/oropharyngeal swabs reverse transcription-PCR test results positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The present study is a phase II prospective, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial which analyzed 36 patients. Two aspects were evaluated during the 14-day follow-up period: i) The time for reaching a patient acceptable symptom state (PASS), and ii) the last day of each COVID-19 symptom presentation. Adverse effects were evaluated. The clinical severity for all the patients in the study was mild (88.9%) and moderate (11.1%). The control (placebo) group achieved PASS on day 8.0 +/- 1.3, compared with day 4.4 +/- 0.8 in the mefenamic acid group (P=0.020, Kaplan-Meier analyses using log-rank tests). Patients that received mefenamic acid plus standard medical care had a similar to 16-fold higher probability of achieving PASS on day 8 (adjusted RR, 15.57; 95% CI, 1.22-198.71; P=0.035), compared with the placebo plus standard medical care group. All symptoms lasted for fewer days in the mefenamic acid group, compared with the placebo group; however, only the symptoms of headache (P=0.008), retro-orbital eye pain (P=0.049), and sore throat (P=0.029) exhibited statistically significant differences. The experimental treatment produced no severe adverse effects. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that the administration of mefenamic acid markedly reduced the symptomatology and time to reach PASS in ambulatory patients with COVID-19. Due to its probable antiviral effects and potent anti-inflammatory mechanisms, mefenamic acid may prove to be useful in the treatment of COVID-19, in combination with other drugs, including the new antivirals (remdesivir, molnupiravir, or favipiravir). However, future studies are also required to confirm these findings.

TI  - Drug repurposing for the treatment of COVID-19: Pharmacological aspects and synthetic approaches
T2  - BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB  - In December 2019, a new variant of SARS-CoV emerged, the so-called acute severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and has been plaguing the world owing to its unprecedented spread efficiency, which has resulted in a huge death toll. In this sense, the repositioning of approved drugs is the fastest way to an effective response to a pandemic outbreak of this scale. Considering these facts, in this review we provide a comprehensive and critical discussion on the chemical aspects surrounding the drugs currently being studied as candidates for COVID-19 therapy. We intend to provide the general chemical community with an overview on the synthetic/biosynthetic pathways related to such molecules, as well as their mechanisms of action against the evaluated viruses and some insights on the pharmacological interactions involved in each case. Overall, the review aims to present the chemical aspects of the main bioactive molecules being considered to be repositioned for effective treatment of COVID-19 in all phases, from the mildest to the most severe.

TI  - Candidate drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19
T2  - PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Outbreak and pandemic of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in 2019/2020 will challenge global health for the future. Because a vaccine against the virus will not be available in the near future, we herein try to offer a pharmacological strategy to combat the virus. There exists a number of candidate drugs that may inhibit infection with and replication of SARS-CoV-2. Such drugs comprise inhibitors of TMPRSS2 serine protease and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Blockade of ACE2, the host cell receptor for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and inhibition of TMPRSS2, which is required for S protein priming may prevent cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Further, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and off-label antiviral drugs, such as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs arbidol and favipiravir as well as antiviral phytochemicals available to date may limit spread of SARS-CoV-2 and morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of favipiravir, an oral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, in mild-to-moderate COVID-19: A randomized, comparative, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in adults with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
   Methods: In this randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, multicenter, phase 3 trial, adults (18-75 years) with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and mild-to-moderate symptoms (including asymptomatic) were randomized 1:1 to oral favipiravir (day 1: 1800 mg BID and days 2-14: 800 mg BID) plus standard supportive care versus supportive care alone. The primary endpoint was time to the cessation of viral shedding; time to clinical cure was also measured.
   Results: From May 14 to July 3, 2020, 150 patients were randomized to favipiravir (n = 75) or control (n = 75). Median time to the cessation of viral shedding was 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 7 days) versus 7 days (95% CI: 5 days, 8 days), P = 0.129, and median time to clinical cure was 3 days (95% CI: 3 days, 4 days) versus 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 6 days), P = 0.030, for favipiravir and control, respectively. Adverse events were observed in 36% of favipiravir and 8% of control patients. One control patient died due to worsening disease.
   Conclusion: The lack of statistical significance on the primary endpoint was confounded by limitations of the RT-PCR assay. Significant improvement in time to clinical cure suggests favipiravir may be beneficial in mild-to-moderate COVID-19. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Evaluation of Drug-Induced Liver Injury in Hospitalized Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Elevated liver enzymes are frequently reported in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Several mechanisms of liver injury have been proposed, but no clear conclusions were drawn. We aimed to evaluate hepatocellular and cholestatic injury in relation to the administration of potentially hepatotoxic drugs included in the current COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines in a retrospective cohort of 396 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The main findings of our study are: (1) Significant increase in aminotransferases level was observed during hospitalization, suggesting drug-related hepatotoxicity. (2) Tocilizumab was correlated with hepatocellular injury, including ALT values greater than five times the upper limit of normal. (3) Anakinra was correlated with ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of normal. (4) Younger patients receiving tocilizumab or anakinra had a higher risk of hepatocellular injury. (5) The combination of favipiravir with tocilizumab was associated with AST values greater than three times the upper limit of normal and with an increase in direct bilirubin. (6) The administration of at least three potentially hepatotoxic drugs was correlated with hepatocellular injury, including ALT values greater than five times the upper limit of normal, and with the increase in indirect bilirubin. (7) Remdesivir and favipiravir by themselves did not correlate with hepatocellular or cholestatic injury in our study cohort.

TI  - Drug-drug Interactions between COVID-19 Treatments and Antidepressants, Mood Stabilizers/Anticonvulsants, and Benzodiazepines: Integrated Evidence from 3 Databases
T2  - PHARMACOPSYCHIATRY
AB  - Introduction The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with psychiatric comorbidities leads to a scenario in which the use of psychotropic drugs may be required. This requires the support of evidence-based medicine to take into account possible interactions between antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, and coronavirus infection treatments.
   Methods Three databases were consulted: (a) Lexicomp Drug Interactions, (b) Micromedex Solutions Drugs Interactions, (c)Liverpool Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. The CredibleMeds QTDrugs List was also queried. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, anakinra, and dexamethasone - drugs used for SARS-CoV-2 - were analyzed, and consensus recommendations are made.
   Results The potential interactions of agomelatine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipran, and vortioxetine with COVID-19 treatments shall be considered less risky. Antidepressant interactions with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin enhance the risk of QT prolongation, and ECG monitoring is advised for most antidepressants. Antidepressants with lopinavir/ritonavir involve multiple CYP enzyme interactions (except with milnacipran). Gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, topiramate, and zonisamide are safe treatment options that have no significant interactions with COVID-19 treatments. Lithium is contraindicated with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin. Precaution should be taken in using valproic acid with lopinavir-ritonavir. The use of benzodiazepines does not present a risk of drug interaction with COVID-19 treatments, except lopinavir/ritonavir.
   Conclusions Clinicians prescribing antidepressants, mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines, should be aware of the probable risk of drug-drug interaction with COVID-19 medications and may benefit from heeding these recommendations for use to ensure patient safety.

TI  - A review on drug repurposing in COVID-19: from antiviral drugs to herbal alternatives
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENETIC ENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Background COVID-19 is an illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Due to its rapid spread, in March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic. Since the outbreak of pandemic many governments, scientists, and institutions started to work on new vaccines and finding of new and repurposing drugs. Main body of the abstract Drug repurposing is an excellent option for discovery of already used drugs, effective against COVID-19, lowering the cost of production, and shortening the period of delivery, especially when preclinical safety studies have already been performed. There are many approved drugs that showed significant results against COVID-19, like ivermectin and hydrochloroquine, including alternative treatment options against COVID-19, utilizing herbal medicine. Short conclusion This article summarized 11 repurposing drugs, their positive and negative health implications, along with traditional herbal alternatives, that harvest strong potential in efficient treatments options against COVID-19, with small or no significant side effects. Out of 11 repurposing drugs, four drugs are in status of emergency approval, most of them being in phase IV clinical trials. The first repurposing drug approved for clinical usage is remdesivir, whereas chloroquine and hydrochloroquine approval for emergency use was revoked by FDA for COVID-19 treatment in June 2020.

TI  - A new glimpse on the active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, coupled with drug repurposing study
T2  - MOLECULAR DIVERSITY
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Its main protease, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), is an attractive target for drug design, due to its importance in virus replication. The analysis of the radial distribution function of 159 3CLpro structures reveals a high similarity index. A study of the catalytic pocket of 3CLpro with bound inhibitors reveals that the influence of the inhibitors is local, perturbing dominantly only residues in the active pocket. A machine learning based model with high predictive ability against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is designed and validated. The model is used to perform a drug-repurposing study, with the main aim to identify existing drugs with the highest 3CLpro inhibition power. Among antiviral agents, lopinavir, idoxuridine, paritaprevir, and favipiravir showed the highest inhibition potential.

TI  - An economical and practical procedure of favipiravir synthesis for the treatment of Covid-19
T2  - CHEMICAL PAPERS
AB  - Favipiravir is a wide-spectrum antiviral generic drug that has received large attention during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. While there are synthetic strategies for favipiravir synthesis, economical procedures could contribute to industrial scale synthesis and availability. Accordingly, our efforts focused on an economic and scalable procedure for favipiravir synthesis via the 3,6-dichloropyrazine-2-carbonitrile intermediate obtained from 3-aminopyrazine-2-carboxylic acid. The process afforded favipiravir with 43% yield (from 3,6-dichloropyrazine-2-carbonitrile, by fluorination, hydroxylation, and nitrile hydrolysis reactions) and greater than 99% purity without a chromatographic purification step.

TI  - In vitro studies for BCS classification of an antiviral agent, favipiravir
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PHARMACY
AB  - Favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) is a purine nucleic acid analog, which is an antiviral agent used in the treatment of influenza. Since the recent outbreak caused by 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV), there has been a seek for effective antiviral agents to be used in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and favipiravir has been one of the options which provides a broad-spectrum therapy. Herein, we studied the aqueous solubility and in vitro permeability characteristics of favipiravir in order to shed light on the BCS classification of this antiviral agent used in COVID-19 therapy. The in vitro solubility was assessed using saturated solution of favipiravir in four different aqueous media and the solubility values were evaluated during 72 h at 37 degrees C. The solubility of favipiravir was between 4.48 to 8.5 mg/ml, which is 5.85 to 10.63 times of calculated solubility limit. Caco-2 cell monolayers were utilized for the permeability assessment, and the drug solutions in three different concentrations including the highest dose required for bioequivalence exemption of the immediate release dosage form were applied. The effect of efflux transporters on the permeability of favipiravir was also determined using a P-gp inhibitor, Verapamil HCl. According to the data obtained from the in vitro studies, favipiravir can be considered as a representative of class I compound.

TI  - Emerging Therapeutic Approaches to Combat COVID-19: Present Status and Future Perspectives
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a fast-paced epidemic in late 2019 which is disrupting life-saving immunization services. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible virus and an infectious disease that has caused fear among people across the world. The worldwide emergence and rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the need for exploring innovative therapeutic approaches to combat SARS-CoV-2. The efficacy of some antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, umifenovir, etc., are still tested against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, there is a large global effort to develop vaccines for the protection against COVID-19. Because vaccines seem the best solution to control the pandemic but time is required for its development, pre-clinical/clinical trials, approval from FDA and scale-up. The nano-based approach is another promising approach to combat COVID-19 owing to unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials. Peptide based vaccines emerged as promising vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2. The study emphasizes the current therapeutic approaches against SARS-CoV-2 and some of the potential candidates for SARS-CoV-2 treatment which are still under clinical studies for their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, it is of high importance to mention that clinical trials are necessary for confirming promising drug candidates and effective vaccines and the safety profile of the new components must be evaluated before translation of in vitro studies for implementation in clinical use.

TI  - Challenges of drug development during the COVID-19 pandemic: Key considerations for clinical trial designs
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - There is an urgent need for targeted and effective COVID-19 treatments. Several medications, including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, favipiravir, tocilizumab and others have been identified as potential treatments for COVID-19. Bringing these repurposed medications to the public for COVID-19 requires robust and high-quality clinical trials that must be conducted under extremely challenging pandemic conditions. This article reviews translational science principles and strategies for conducting clinical trials in a pandemic and evaluates recent trials for different drug candidates. We hope that this knowledge will help focus efforts during this crisis and lead to the expedited development and approval of COVID-19 therapies.

TI  - Existing antiviral options against SARS-CoV-2 replication in COVID-19 patients
T2  - FUTURE MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, is an international concern. This infection requires urgent efforts to develop new antiviral compounds. To date, no specific drug in controlling this disease has been identified. Developing the new treatment is usually time consuming, therefore using the repurposing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs could be an effective strategy to respond immediately. In this review, a number of broad-spectrum antivirals with potential efficacy to inhibit the virus replication via targeting the virus spike protein (S protein), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) that are critical in the pathogenesis and life cycle of coronavirus, have been evaluated as possible treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - FAVIPIRAVIR THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 is sometimes severe and life-threatening, and currently there is no specific effective drug approved for COVID-19 treatment. Favipiravir is a pyrazine analog inhibiting RNA virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. An observational study was conducted in confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to a university hospital in Thailand on effectiveness and safety of favipiravir prescribed on a compassionate-use basis. Among COVID-19 patients with pneumonia (n = 37), 54 and 46% had severe and non-severe pneumonia, respectively. Mean +/- SD age was 48 +/- 3 years, 62% were male and diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the most common comorbidities. Median period from initiation of favipiravir treatment to clinical improvement of patients with severe and non-severe pneumonia was 17 days (95% confidence interval (CI): 9-25) and 9 days (95% CI: 7-11) respectively. Ninety-five percent of patients completely recovered and were discharged within 39 days following admittance; unfortunately, the remaining patients succumbed to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. In conclusion, favipiravir holds promise as a potential drug for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, but a larger randomized trial is warranted to confirm its efficacy.

TI  - A global treatments for coronaviruses including COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - In late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, several patients with viral pneumonia were identified as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). So far, there are no specific treatments for patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), and the treatments available today are based on previous experience with similar viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Influenza virus. In this article, we have tried to reach a therapeutic window of drugs available to patients with COVID-19. Cathepsin L is required for entry of the 2019-nCoV virus into the cell as target teicoplanin inhibits virus replication. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) in soluble form as a recombinant protein can prevent the spread of coronavirus by restricting binding and entry. In patients with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine decreases the inflammatory response and cytokine storm, but overdose causes toxicity and mortality. Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019-nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS-CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID-19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS-CoV. Ribavirin reduces hemoglobin concentrations in respiratory patients, and remdesivir improves respiratory symptoms. Use of ribavirin in combination with LPV/r in patients with SARS-CoV reduces acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, which has a significant protective effect with the addition of corticosteroids. Favipiravir increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger antiviral effect than LPV/r. currently, appropriate treatment for patients with COVID-19 is an ACE2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.

TI  - Core shell stationary phase for a novel separation of some COVID-19 used drugs by UPLC-MS/MS Method: Study of grapefruit consumption impact on their pharmacokinetics in rats
T2  - MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB  - A sensitive and selective UPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the synchronized determination of four drugs used in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), namely, azithromycin, apixaban, dexamethasone, and favipiravir in rat plasma. using a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (50 mm x 4.6 mm, 2.7 m) with a high-resolution ESI tandem mass spectrometer detection with multiple reaction monitoring. We used an Agilent Poroshell column, which is characterized by a stationary phase based on non-porous core particles. With a remarkable improvement in the number of theoretical plates and low column backpressure. In addition, the developed method was employed in studying the potential food-drug interaction of grapefruit juice (GFJ) with the selected drugs which affects their pharmacokinetics in rats. The LC-MS/MS operated in positive and negative ionization mode using two internal standards: moxifloxacin and chlorthalidone, respectively. Liquid-liquid extraction of the cited drugs from rat plasma was accomplished using diethyl ether: dichloromethane (70:30, v/v). The analytes were separated using methanol: 0.1 % formic acid in water (95: 5, v/v) as a mobile phase in isocratic mode of elution pumped at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. A detailed validation of the bio-analytical method was performed in accordance with US-FDA and EMA guidelines.
   Concerning the in vivo pharmacokinetic study, the statistical significance between the results of the test groups receiving GFJ along with the cited drugs and the control group was assessed demonstrating that GFJ increased the plasma concentration of azithromycin, apixaban, and dexamethasone. Accordingly, this food-drug interaction requires cautious ingestion of GFJ in patients using (SARS-CoV-2) medications as it can produce negative effects in the safety of the drug therapy. A potential drug-drug interaction is also suggested between those medications requiring a suitable dose adjustment.

TI  - Phase II Clinical Trial of Combination Therapy with Favipiravir and Methylprednisolone for COVID-19 with Non-Critical Respiratory Failure
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THERAPY
AB  - Introduction The administration of systemic corticosteroids is a key strategy for improving COVID-19 outcomes. However, evidence is lacking on combination therapies of antiviral agents and systemic corticosteroids. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of favipiravir and methylprednisolone in preventing respiratory failure progression in patients with COVID-19 and non-critical respiratory failure. Methods We conducted a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase II study. The patients received favipiravir 3600 mg on the first day, followed by 1600 mg for a total of 10-14 days. Methylprednisolone was administered intravenously at 1 mg/ideal body weight (IBW)/day from days 1 to 5, followed by 0.5 mg/IBW/day from days 6 to 10 if clinically indicated. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) (including noninvasive positive pressure ventilation) or those who met the criteria for tracheal intubation within 14 days of the study treatment initiation (MVCTI-14). Results Sixty-nine patients were enrolled and underwent the study treatment. Of them, the MVCTI-14 proportion was 29.2% (90% confidence interval 20.1-39.9, p = 0.200). The proportion of patients who required MV or who died within 30 days was 26.2%, and 30-day mortality was 4.9%. The most significant risk factor for MVCTI-14 was a smoking history (odds ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2-14.2). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse event was hyperglycemia, which was observed in 21.7%. Conclusion The MVCTI-14 proportion did not reach a favorable level in the clinical trial setting with the threshold of 35%. However, the proportion of MV or death within 30 days was 26.6%, which might be close to the findings (28.1%) of the RECOVERY trial, which showed the efficacy of dexamethasone for patients with COVID-19 and non-critical respiratory failure. Further evaluation of this combination therapy is needed.

TI  - Favipiravir and Its Structural Analogs: Antiviral Activity and Synthesis Methods
T2  - ACTA NATURAE
AB  - 1,4-Pyrazine-3-carboxamide-based antiviral compounds have been under intensive study for the last 20 years. One of these compounds, favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide, T-705), is approved for use against the influenza infection in a number of countries. Now, favipiravir is being actively used against COVID-19. This review describes the in vivo metabolism of favipiravir, the mechanism of its antiviral activity, clinical findings, toxic properties, and the chemical synthesis routes for its production. We provide data on the synthesis and antiviral activity of structural analogs of favipiravir, including nucleosides and nucleotides based on them.

TI  - A Scoping Insight on Potential Prophylactics, Vaccines and Therapeutic Weaponry for the Ongoing Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic- A Comprehensive Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The emergence of highly virulent CoVs (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of novel ongoing "COVID-19" pandemics has been marked as an alarming case of pneumonia posing a large global healthcare crisis of unprecedented magnitude. Currently, the COVID-19 outbreak has fueled an international demand in the biomedical field for the mitigation of the fast-spreading illness, all through the urgent deployment of safe, effective, and rational therapeutic strategies along with epidemiological control. Confronted with such contagious respiratory distress, the global population has taken significant steps towards a more robust strategy of containment and quarantine to halt the total number of positive cases but such a strategy can only delay the spread. A substantial number of potential vaccine candidates are undergoing multiple clinical trials to combat COVID-19 disease, includes live-attenuated, inactivated, viral-vectored based, sub-unit vaccines, DNA, mRNA, peptide, adjuvant, plant, and nanoparticle-based vaccines. However, there are no licensed anti-COVID-19 drugs/therapies or vaccines that have proven to work as more effective therapeutic candidates in open-label clinical trial studies. To counteract the infection (SARS-CoV-2), many people are under prolonged treatment of many chemical drugs that inhibit the PLpro activity (Ribavirin), viral proteases (Lopinavir/Ritonavir), RdRp activity (Favipiravir, Remdesivir), viral membrane fusion (Umifenovir, Chloroquine phosphate (CQ), Hydroxychloroquine phosphate (HCQ), IL-6 overexpression (Tocilizumab, Siltuximab, Sarilumab). Mesenchymal Stem Cell therapy and Convalescent Plasma Therapy have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 virion. On the other hand, repurposing previously designed antiviral agents with tolerable safety profile and efficacy could be the only promising approach and fast response to the novel virion. In addition, research institutions and corporations have commenced the redesign of the available therapeutic strategy to manage the global crisis. Herein, we present succinct information on selected anti-COVID-19 therapeutic medications repurposed to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, this review will provide exhaustive detail on recent prophylactic strategies and ongoing clinical trials to curb this deadly pandemic, outlining the major therapeutic areas for researchers to step in.

TI  - Benefits of treatment with favipiravir in hospitalized patients for COVID-19: a retrospective observational case-control study
T2  - VIROLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Background Although more than a year past since COVID-19 was defined, there is no specific treatment yet. Since COVID-19 management differs over time, it is hard to determine which therapy is more efficacious. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the regimen with Favipiravir (FPV) and determine if the timing of FPV addition offers any improvement. Methods A retrospective observational case-controlled cohort study was performed between March and September 2020, including adults with COVID-19 in a single-center in Turkey. We categorized patients into age-sex matched three groups, group 1 (n = 48) and group 2 (n = 48) included patients treated with the combination of FPV plus Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) early and late, respectively. Group 3 (n = 48) consisted of patients on HQ monotherapy. In Group 2, if the respiratory or clinic condition had not improved sufficiently, FPV was added on or after day 3. Results We found that starting FPV early had an impact on PCR negativity and the progression of the disease. 'No progression' was defined as the absence of a new finding in the control radiological examination and the absence of accompanying clinical deterioration. Also, the decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) was greater in Group 1 than Group 3 (p < 0.001). However, we found that early initiation of FPV treatment did not have a positive effect on the estimated survival time. Conclusions According to this retrospective study results, we believe that for better clinical outcomes, FPV treatment should be started promptly to enhance antiviral effects and improve clinical outcomes.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19: Viral Genomics, Epidemiology, Vaccines, and Therapeutic Interventions
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is due to infection caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that impacts the lower respiratory tract. The spectrum of symptoms ranges from asymptomatic infections to mild respiratory symptoms to the lethal form of COVID-19 which is associated with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and fatality. To address this global crisis, up-to-date information on viral genomics and transcriptomics is crucial for understanding the origins and global dispersion of the virus, providing insights into viral pathogenicity, transmission, and epidemiology, and enabling strategies for therapeutic interventions, drug discovery, and vaccine development. Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology, genomic etiology, findings from recent transcriptomic map analysis, viral-human protein interactions, molecular diagnostics, and the current status of vaccine and novel therapeutic intervention development. Moreover, we provide an extensive list of resources that will help the scientific community access numerous types of databases related to SARS-CoV-2 OMICs and approaches to therapeutics related to COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV
T2  - FUTURE MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, large in silico screening studies and numerous in vitro studies have assessed the antiviral activity of various drugs on SARS-CoV-2. In the context of health emergency, drug repurposing represents the most relevant strategy because of the reduced time for approval by international medicines agencies, the low cost of development and the well-known toxicity profile of such drugs. Herein, we aim to review drugs with in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, combined with molecular docking data and results from preliminary clinical studies. Finally, when considering all these previous findings, as well as the possibility of oral administration, 11 molecules consisting of nelfinavir, favipiravir, azithromycin, clofoctol, clofazimine, ivermectin, nitazoxanide, amodiaquine, heparin, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, show an interesting antiviral activity that could be exploited as possible drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Antiviral Therapeutic Approaches for SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Systematic Review
T2  - PHARMACEUTICALS
AB  - Due to the lack of an etiologic treatment for SARS-CoV-2 and the difficulties involved in developing new drugs, some drugs already approved for other diseases or with efficacy against SARS and MERS, have been used in patients with COVID-19. This systematic review aims to summarize evidence on the efficacy and safety of five antivirals applied to patients with COVID-19, that have proven to be effective either in vitro studies or in studies on SARS-CoV and MERS.; An intensive search of different databases (Pub Med, WoS, MEDLINE and Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register) has been carried out until the end of April 2021. This systematic review has been conducted according to the PRISMA statement. From each of the included studies, the characteristics of the intervention and comparison groups, demographic data and results were extracted independently; Remdesivir is well tolerated and helps to accelerate clinical improvement but is ineffective in reducing mortality. Favipiravir is safe and shows promising results regarding symptom resolution but does not improve viral clearance. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir has been associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events and it has not proven to be effective. No significant differences were observed between patients treated with ribavirin or umifenovir and their respective control groups; Remdesivir and favipiravir are well tolerated and effective in accelerating clinical improvement. This systematic review does not support the use of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and umifenovir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Treatment of COVID-19 patients with quercetin: a prospective, single center, randomized, controlled trial
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
AB  - Scientific research continues on new preventive and therapeutic strategies against severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). So far, there is no proven curative treatment, and a valid alternative therapeutic approach needs to be developed. This study is designed to evaluate the effect of quercetin in COVID-19 treatment. This was a single-centre, prospective randomized controlled cohort study. Routine care versus QCB (quercetin, vitamin C, bromelain) supplementation was compared between 429 patients with at least one chronic disease and moderate-to-severe respiratory symptoms. Demographic features, signs, laboratory results and drug administration data of patients were recorded. The endpoint was that QCB supplementation was continued throughout the follow-up period from study baseline to discharge, intubation, or death. The most common complaints at the time of hospital admission were fatigue (62.4%), cough (61.1%), anorexia (57%), thirst (53.7%), respiratory distress (51%) and chills (48.3%). The decrease in CRP and ferritin levels was higher in the QCB group (all Ps were < 0.05). In the QCB group, the increase in platelet and lymphocyte counts was higher (all Ps were < 0.05). QCB did not reduce the risk of events during follow-up. Adjustments for statistically significant parameters, including the lung stage, use of favipiravir and presence of comorbidity did not change the results. While there was no difference between the groups in terms of event frequency, the QCB group had more advanced pulmonary findings. QCB supplement is shown to have a positive effect on laboratory recovery. While there was no difference between the groups in terms of event frequency, QCB supplement group had more advanced pulmonar findings, and QCB supplement is shown to have a positive effect on laboratory recovery/results. Therefore, we conclude that further studies involving different doses and plasma level measurements are required to reveal the dose/response relationship and bioavailability of QCB for a better understanding of the role of QCB in the treatment of SARS CoV-2.

TI  - Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Favipiravir in Adult Indian Patients with Mild-to-Moderate COVID-19 in a Real-World Setting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of favipiravir, which is prescribed for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India.
   Patients and Methods: This was a prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm postmarketing study conducted in India. Patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 received favipiravir (3600 mg [1800 mg orally twice daily] on the first day, followed by 800 mg orally twice daily, up to a maximum of 14 days) as a part of their treatment. The primary endpoints were to evaluate the safety of favipiravir by assessing the number of adverse events (AEs) and treatment-related AEs. The secondary endpoints were to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir by assessing time to clinical cure, rate of clinical cure, time to pyrexia resolution, rate of oxygen requirement, and all-cause mortality.
   Results: A total of 1083 patients were enrolled in this study from December 2020 to June 2021. Adverse events were reported in 129 patients (11.9%), 116 (10.7%) of whom had mild AEs. Dose modification or withdrawal of favipiravir treatment was reported in four patients (0.37%). The median time to clinical cure and pyrexia resolution was 7 and 4 days, respectively. A total of 1036 patients (95.8%) exhibited clinical cure by day 14. Oxygen support was required by 15 patients (1.4%). One death was reported, which was unrelated to favipiravir.
   Conclusion: In the real-world setting, favipiravir was well-tolerated, and no new safety signals were detected.

TI  - An Assessment of the Impact of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic on National Antimicrobial Consumption in Jordan
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has overlapping clinical characteristics with bacterial respiratory tract infection, leading to the prescription of potentially unnecessary antibiotics. This study aimed at measuring changes and patterns of national antimicrobial use for one year preceding and one year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Annual national antimicrobial consumption for 2019 and 2020 was obtained from the Jordan Food and Drug Administration (JFDA) following the WHO surveillance methods. The WHO Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) classification was used. Total antibiotic consumption in 2020 (26.8 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day) decreased by 5.5% compared to 2019 (28.4 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day). There was an increase in the use of several antibiotics during 2020 compared with 2019 (third generation cephalosporins (19%), carbapenems (52%), macrolides (57%), and lincosamides (106%)). In 2020, there was a marked reduction in amoxicillin use (-53%), while the use of azithromycin increased by 74%. National antimicrobial consumption of the Access group decreased by 18% from 2019 to 2020 (59.1% vs. 48.1% of total consumption). The use of the Watch group increased in 2020 by 26%. The study highlighted an increase in the use of certain antibiotics during the pandemic period that are known to be associated with increasing resistance. Efforts to enhance national antimicrobial stewardship are needed to ensure rational use of antimicrobials.

TI  - Experiences of the combined use of Favipiravir in patients using Lorlatinib and Brigatinib
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY PHARMACY PRACTICE
AB  - Introduction The SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging the management of cancer patients. In this article, we present two patients diagnosed with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) + non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCL CA), infected with COVID-19, who had a previous multi-line therapy with Brigatinib and Lorlatinib, and received Favipiravir for their current infection. Case reports A 58-year-old man and a 65-year-old woman were diagnosed as ALK ( + ) NSCL CA. Both patients received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for lung cancer when diagnosed with COVID-19. No adverse effects were observed with the concurrent use of Favipiravir, an antiviral drug currently used for COVID-19 and TKI. Management and outcome Considering the pharmacokinetic effects of favipiravir and the ALK inhibitor TKI's used on our cases (Brigatinib-Lorlatinib), the concurrent use of these drugs was safe and prevented the delay in the primary treatment of the malignancy of our patients. Discussion To our knowledge, these are the only reported cases diagnosed as ALK ( + ) NSCL CA who received favipiravir because of COVID-19 while using TKI, and both patients recovered completely without any side effects.

TI  - A comparative analysis of remdesivir and other repurposed antivirals against SARS-CoV-2
T2  - EMBO MOLECULAR MEDICINE
AB  - The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic stresses the need for effective antiviral drugs that can quickly be applied in order to reduce morbidity, mortality, and ideally viral transmission. By repurposing of broadly active antiviral drugs and compounds that are known to inhibit viral replication of related viruses, several advances could be made in the development of treatment strategies against COVID-19. The nucleoside analog remdesivir, which is known for its potent in vitro activity against Ebolavirus and other RNA viruses, was recently shown to reduce the time to recovery in patients with severe COVID-19. It is to date the only approved antiviral for treating COVID-19. Here, we provide a mechanism and evidence-based comparative review of remdesivir and other repurposed drugs with proven in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Potential Prophylactic Treatments for COVID-19
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - The World Health Organization declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern at the end of January 2020 and a pandemic two months later. The virus primarily spreads between humans via respiratory droplets, and is the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which can vary in severity, from asymptomatic or mild disease (the vast majority of the cases) to respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and death. Recently, several vaccines were approved for emergency use against SARS-CoV-2. However, their worldwide availability is acutely limited, and therefore, SARS-CoV-2 is still expected to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the upcoming year. Hence, additional countermeasures are needed, particularly pharmaceutical drugs that are widely accessible, safe, scalable, and affordable. In this comprehensive review, we target the prophylactic arena, focusing on small-molecule candidates. In order to consolidate a potential list of such medications, which were categorized as either antivirals, repurposed drugs, or miscellaneous, a thorough screening for relevant clinical trials was conducted. A brief molecular and/or clinical background is provided for each potential drug, rationalizing its prophylactic use as an antiviral or inflammatory modulator. Drug safety profiles are discussed, and current medical indications and research status regarding their relevance to COVID-19 are shortly reviewed. In the near future, a significant body of information regarding the effectiveness of drugs being clinically studied for COVID-19 is expected to accumulate, in addition to information regarding the efficacy of prophylactic treatments.

TI  - QT Prolongation in Critically Ill Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Background: Several reports linked the use of repurposed drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir with QT interval prolongation in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Little is known about the risk factors for QT interval prolongation in this population. We sought to describe the prevalence and identify the main risk factors associated with clinically significant corrected QT (QTc) prolongation in this population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of critically ill patients who were admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU), had at least one electrocardiogram performed during their ICU stay, and tested positive for SARs-CoV-2. Clinically significant QTc interval prolongation was defined as QTc >500 milliseconds (ms). Results: Out of the 111 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, QTc was significantly prolonged in 47 cases (42.3%). Patients with a clinically significant QTc prolongation had significantly higher proportions of history of cardiac diseases/surgery (22 [46.8%] vs. 10 [15.6%], P < .001), hypokalemia (10 [21.3] vs. 5 [7.8%], P = .04), and male gender (95% vs. 82.8%, P = .036) than patients with QTc <= 500 ms, respectively. A total of 46 patients (41.4%) received HCQ, 28 (25.2%) received lopinavir/ritonavir, and 5 (4.5%) received azithromycin. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a history of cardiac disease was the only independent factor associated with clinically significant QTc prolongation (P = .004 for the likelihood-ratio test). Conclusion: The prevalence of clinically significant QTc prolongation in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was high and independent of drugs used. Larger prospective observational studies are warranted to elucidate independent risk factors associated with clinically significant QTc prolongation in this study population.

TI  - Therapeutic Development in COVID-19
T2  - CORONAVIRUS DISEASE - COVID-19
AB  - Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2, the disease has spread rapidly worldwide and developed into a global pandemic, causing a significant impact on the global health system and economic development. Scientists have been racing to find effective drugs and vaccines for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. However, due to the diversity of clinical manifestations caused by COVID-19, no standard antiviral regimen beyond supportive therapy has been established. Ongoing clinical trials are underway to evaluate the efficacy of drugs that primarily act on the viral replication cycle or enhanced immunity of patients. This chapter will summarize the currently used antiviral and adjuvant therapies in clinical practice and provide a theoretical basis for the future treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - The development of a quarantine strategy is an important path to a normalized response to COVID-19
T2  - BIOSCIENCE TRENDS
AB  - The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is still in a global pandemic that has affected more than 200 countries. When prevention and control of COVID-19 is gradually normalized, communication between countries needs to be gradually restored due to development needs. There are 34 vaccines in the clinical evaluation stage and 145 vaccines in the preclinical evaluation stage in the global COVID-19 vaccine research and development program, but the rate and process of vaccination may not be sufficient to meet the current needs of society for restoring development and communication. Studies have found that chloroquine, favipiravir, remdesivir and other drugs are useful for COVID-19, but currently them is no specific drug for the treatment of COVID-19. The main detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 at present include pathogenic detection methods, molecular biology detection methods and antibody detection of which molecular biology detection technology is the main detection method at present. There are some more convenient and rapid detection methods. A study showed that salivary nucleic acid testing could be used for large-scale screening of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the results showed that the probability of true concordance between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva was stubbornly 0.998 (90% CI: 0.996-0.999). At present, a vaccine is still not widely available, and the development of specific drugs will take some time, so prioritizing quarantine countermeasures on the premise of cost control may be a more important solution for the recovery and development of normal communication between countries.

TI  - Bioactive Molecules of Tea as Potential Inhibitors for RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase of SARS-CoV-2
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a worldwide pandemic, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). At this moment in time, there are no specific therapeutics available to combat COVID-19. Drug repurposing and identification of naturally available bioactive molecules to target SARS-CoV-2 are among the key strategies to tackle the notorious virus. The enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) performs a pivotal role in replicating the virus. RdRp is a prime target for Remdesivir and other nucleotides analog-based antiviral drugs. In this study, we showed three bioactive molecules from tea (epicatechin-3,5-di-O-gallate, epigallocatechin-3,5-di-O-gallate, and epigallocatechin-3,4-di-O-gallate) that showed better interaction with critical residues present at the catalytic center and the NTP entry channel of RdRp than antiviral drugs Remdesivir and Favipiravir. Our computational approach to identify these molecules included molecular docking studies, followed by robust molecular dynamics simulations. All the three molecules are readily available in tea and could be made accessible along with other medications to treat COVID-19 patients. However, these results require validation by further in vitro and in vivo studies.

TI  - Discovery, Development, and Patent Trends on Molnupiravir: A Prospective Oral Treatment for COVID-19
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic needs no introduction at present. Only a few treatments are available for this disease, including remdesivir and favipiravir. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical industry is striving to develop new treatments for COVID-19. Molnupiravir, an orally active RdRp inhibitor, is in a phase 3 clinical trial against COVID-19. The objective of this review article is to enlighten the researchers working on COVID-19 about the discovery, recent developments, and patents related to molnupiravir. Molnupiravir was originally developed for the treatment of influenza at Emory University, USA. However, this drug has also demonstrated activity against a variety of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Now it is being jointly developed by Emory University, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, and Merck to treat COVID-19. The published clinical data indicate a good safety profile, tolerability, and oral bioavailability of molnupiravir in humans. The patient-compliant oral dosage form of molnupiravir may hit the market in the first or second quarter of 2022. The patent data of molnupiravir revealed its granted compound patent and process-related patent applications. We also anticipate patent filing related to oral dosage forms, inhalers, and a combination of molnupiravir with marketed drugs like remdesivir, favipiravir, and baricitinib. The current pandemic demands a patient compliant, safe, tolerable, and orally effective COVID-19 treatment. The authors believe that molnupiravir meets these requirements and is a breakthrough COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Recent advances in small-molecular therapeutics for COVID-19
T2  - PRECISION CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic poses a fundamental challenge to global health. Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, great efforts have been made to identify antiviral strategies and develop therapeutic drugs to combat the disease. There are different strategies for developing small molecular anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, including targeting coronavirus structural proteins (e.g. spike protein), non-structural proteins (nsp) (e.g. RdRp, M-pro, PLpro, helicase, nsp14, and nsp16), host proteases (e.g. TMPRSS2, cathepsin, and furin) and the pivotal proteins mediating endocytosis (e.g. PIKfyve), as well as developing endosome acidification agents and immune response modulators. Favipiravir and chloroquine are the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that were identified earlier in this epidemic and repurposed for COVID-19 clinical therapy based on these strategies. However, their efficacies are controversial. Currently, three small molecular anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and Paxlovid (PF-07321332 plus ritonavir), have been granted emergency use authorization or approved for COVID-19 therapy in many countries due to their significant curative effects in phase III trials. Meanwhile, a large number of promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates have entered clinical evaluation. The development of these drugs brings hope for us to finally conquer COVID-19. In this account, we conducted a comprehensive review of the recent advances in small molecule anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents according to the target classification. Here we present all the approved drugs and most of the important drug candidates for each target, and discuss the challenges and perspectives for the future research and development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.

TI  - A novel property of hexokinase inhibition by Favipiravir and proposed advantages over Molnupiravir and 2 Deoxy d glucose in treating COVID-19
T2  - BIOTECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Purpose In the wake of SARS-CoV-2's global spread, human activities from health to social life to education have been affected. Favipiravir and Molnupiravir exhibited novel hexokinase inhibition and we discuss advantages of this property in their COVID-19 inhibition potential. Methods This paper describes molecular docking data of human hexokinase II with Favipiravir, Cyan 20, Remdesivir, 2DG, and Molnupiravir along with hexokinase inhibition assays. Results Favipiravir, an antiviral drug previously cleared for treating the flu and ebola, has shown some promise in early trials to treat COVID-19. We observed potent human hexokinase inhibiting potential of Favipiravir (50%) as against 4% and merely 0.3% hexokinase inhibition with Molnupiravir and 2 Deoxy d glucose at 0.1 mM concentration supported by molecular docking studies. Conclusion Favipiravir could continue to be part of the COVID-19 treatment regimen due to its resistance to host esterases, hexokinase inhibition potential and proven safety through human trials.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2: Recent Reports on Antiviral Therapies Based on Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Darunavir/Umifenovir, Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Favipiravir and other Drugs for the Treatment of the New Coronavirus
T2  - CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Here we report on the most recent updates on experimental drugs successfully employed in the treatment of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, also referred to as COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease-19). In particular, several cases of recovered patients have been reported after being treated with lopinavir/ritonavir [which is widely used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection] in combination with the anti-flu drug oseltamivir. In addition, remdesivir, which has been previously administered to Ebola virus patients, has also proven effective in the U.S. against coronavirus, while antimalarial chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and co-administered darunavir and umifenovir (in patient therapies) were also recently recorded as having anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. Since the recoveries/deaths ratio in the last weeks significantly increased, especially in China, it is clear that the experimental antiviral therapy, together with the availability of intensive care unit beds in hospitals and rigorous government control measures, all play an important role in dealing with this virus. This also stresses the urgent need for the scientific community to devote its efforts to the development of other more specific antiviral strategies.

TI  - COVID-19: therapeutic approaches description and discussion
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
AB  - COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 in China, and since then, has disrupted global public health and changed economic paradigms. In dealing with the new Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the world has not faced such extreme global fragility since the "Spanish flu" pandemic in 1918. Researchers globally are dedicating efforts to the search for an effective treatment for COVID-19. Drugs already used in a clinical setting for other pathologies have been tested as a new therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2, setting off a frenzy over the preliminary data of different studies. This work aims to compile and discuss the data published thus far. Despite the potential effects of some antivirals and antiparasitic against COVID-19, clinical studies must confirm real effectiveness. However, non-pharmacological approaches have proven to be the most efficient strategy to date.

TI  - Combination of antiviral drugs inhibits SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and exonuclease and demonstrates COVID-19 therapeutic potential in viral cell culture
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
AB  - In this paper, the hepatitis C virus inhibitors Pibrentasvir and Ombitasvir are found to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease and are shown to have therapeutic potential when combined with SARS-CoV-2 polymerase inhibitors in viral cell cultures.
   SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader, which removes nucleotide inhibitors such as Remdesivir that are incorporated into the viral RNA during replication, reducing the efficacy of these drugs for treating COVID-19. Combinations of inhibitors of both the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the exonuclease could overcome this deficiency. Here we report the identification of hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitors Pibrentasvir and Ombitasvir as SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease inhibitors. In the presence of Pibrentasvir, RNAs terminated with the active forms of the prodrugs Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir and AT-527 were largely protected from excision by the exonuclease, while in the absence of Pibrentasvir, there was rapid excision. Due to its unique structure, Tenofovir-terminated RNA was highly resistant to exonuclease excision even in the absence of Pibrentasvir. Viral cell culture studies also demonstrate significant synergy using this combination strategy. This study supports the use of combination drugs that inhibit both the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and exonuclease for effective COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Nucleoside Inhibitors of Coronaviruses
T2  - CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to a large family of zoonotic supercapsid viruses, including about 40 species of RNA-containing viruses with several strains capable of causing damage to the lungs and respiratory tract. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was responsible for the worldwide SARS outbreak in 2003. The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of significant health concerns and thousands of deaths in 2019-2020 and outlined the need for novel antivirals. The present review is devoted to the development of effective and selective nucleoside drugs for the treatment of corona virus infections. To date, about half of antivirals have been created based on nucleosides. The majority of drugs based on nucleosides have been approved by FDA. This indicates a fruitful area for the development of novel antivirals based on nucleosides. The review describes the main features of pathogenic SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 strains, presents their comparison, considers promising approaches to creating nucleoside drugs for the treatment of coronavirus infections and provides a systematic evaluation of all the known nucleoside derivatives, which inhibit the reproduction of coronaviruses in cells. To date, two known nucleoside drugs (Remdesivir, Favipiravir) have been recommended for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and nine hit compounds based on nucleosides and their analogues have been found, one of which efficiently suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication and eight others inhibiting SARS-CoV replication.

T2  - MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern. Although considerable knowledge has been acquired with time about the viral mechanism of infection and mode of replication, yet no specific drugs or vaccines have been discovered against SARS-CoV-2 to date. There are few small molecule antiviral drugs like Remdesivir and Favipiravir, which have shown promising results in different advanced stages of clinical trials. Chloroquinine, Hydroxychloroquine, and Lopinavir-Ritonavir combination, although initially were hypothesized to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, are now discontinued from the solidarity clinical trials. This review provides a brief description of their chemical syntheses along with their mode of action, and clinical trial results available on Google and in different peer-reviewed journals till 24th October 2020.

TI  - Characterization of the First SARS-CoV-2 Isolates from Aotearoa New Zealand as Part of a Rapid Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has wreaked havoc across the globe for the last two years. More than 300 million cases and over 5 million deaths later, we continue battling the first real pandemic of the 21st century. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly, reaching most countries within the first half of 2020, and New Zealand was not an exception. Here, we describe the first isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants during the initial virus outbreak in New Zealand. Patient-derived nasopharyngeal samples were used to inoculate Vero cells and, three to four days later, a cytopathic effect was observed in seven viral cultures. Viral growth kinetics was characterized using Vero and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. The identity of the viruses was verified by RT-qPCR, Western blot, indirect immunofluorescence assays, and electron microscopy. Whole-genome sequences were analyzed using two different yet complementary deep sequencing platforms (MiSeq/Illumina and Ion PGM (TM)/Ion Torrent (TM)), classifying the viruses as SARS-CoV-2 B.55, B.31, B.1, or B.1.369 based on the Pango Lineage nomenclature. All seven SARS-CoV-2 isolates were susceptible to remdesivir (EC50 values from 0.83 to 2.42 mu M) and beta-D-N-4-hydroxycytidine (molnupiravir, EC50 values from 0.96 to 1.15 mu M) but not to favipiravir (>10 mu M). Interestingly, four SARS-CoV-2 isolates, carrying the D614G substitution originally associated with increased transmissibility, were more susceptible (2.4-fold) to a commercial monoclonal antibody targeting the spike glycoprotein than the wild-type viruses. Altogether, this seminal work allowed for early access to SARS-CoV-2 isolates in New Zealand, paving the way for numerous clinical and scientific research projects in the country, including the development and validation of diagnostic assays, antiviral strategies, and a national COVID-19 vaccine development program.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 pre-exposure prophylaxis: A potential COVID-19 preventive strategy for high-risk populations, including healthcare workers, immunodeficient individuals, and poor vaccine responders
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The unprecedented worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has imposed severe challenges on global health care systems. The roll-out and widespread administration of COVID-19 vaccines has been deemed a major milestone in the race to restrict the severity of the infection. Vaccines have as yet not entirely suppressed the relentless progression of the pandemic, due mainly to the emergence of new virus variants, and also secondary to the waning of protective antibody titers over time. Encouragingly, an increasing number of antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir and the newly developed drug combination, Paxlovid (R) (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir), as well as molnupiravir, have shown significant benefits for COVID-19 patient outcomes. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been proven to be an effective preventive strategy in high-risk uninfected people exposed to HIV. Building on knowledge from what is already known about the use of PrEP for HIV disease, and from recently gleaned knowledge of antivirals used against COVID-19, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 PrEP, using specific antiviral and adjuvant drugs against SARS-CoV-2, may represent a novel preventive strategy for high-risk populations, including healthcare workers, immunodeficient individuals, and poor vaccine responders. Herein, we critically review the risk factors for severe COVID-19 and discuss PrEP strategies against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we outline details of candidate anti-SARS-CoV-2 PrEP drugs, thus creating a framework with respect to the development of alternative and/or complementary strategies to prevent COVID-19, and contributing to the global armamentarium that has been developed to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection, severity, and transmission.

TI  - Favipiravir-induced fever in coronavirus disease 2019: A report of two cases
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Favipiravir, an antiviral agent, is undergoing clinical trials for treating novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we report two cases of COVID-19 with favipiravir-induced fever. In both cases, pyrexia was observed following the administration of favipiravir despite improvements in symptoms of COVID-19. No other cause for fever was evident after careful physical examination and laboratory investigation. The fever subsided in both patients after the discontinuation of favipiravir. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of favipiravir-induced fever in COVID-19 patients. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Current Approaches to COVID-19: Therapy and Prevention
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide. As our understanding of the disease is evolving, our approach to the patient management is also changing swiftly. Available new evidence is helping us take radical decisions in COVID-19 management. We searched for inclusion of the published literature on treatment of COVID-19 from around the globe. All relevant evidences available till the time of submission of this article were briefly discussed. Once advised as blanket therapy for all patients, recent reports of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin indicated no potential benefit and use of such combination may increase the risk of arrhythmias. Clinical evidence with newer antivirals such as remdesivir and favipiravir is promising that can hasten the patient recovery and reduce the mortality. With steroids, evidence is much clear in that it should be used in low dose and for short period not extending beyond 7 days in moderate to severe hospitalized patients. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients and dose should be based on the coagulation profile and risk of thromboembolism. Immunomodulatory drugs such tocilizumab may be considered for severe and critically ill patients to improve the outcomes. Though ulinastatin can be a potential alternative immunomodulator, there is lack of clinical evidence on its usage in COVID-19. Convalescent plasma therapy can be potentially lifesaving in critically ill patients. However, there is need to generate further evidence with various such therapies. Though availability of a potent vaccine is awaited, current treatment of COVID-19 is based on available therapies, which is guided by the evidence. In this review, we discuss the potential treatments available around the globe with current evidence on each of such treatments.

T2  - ANAESTHESIA PAIN & INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - The whole world is experiencing a global pandemic caused by Coronavirus disease 2019. As the pandemic progresses, there has been much research on antiviral drugs, such as hydroxychloroquin, chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, favipiravir, oseltamivir, and umifenovir. Specific antiviral drugs proven to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 have not been found and approved for the medication of COVID-19. Currently, case detection, infection control, monitoring, prevention, and supportive care are the means focused on the treatment of COVID-19. A large scale research is currently underway to analyze safety and efficacy of antiviral drugs, while trials of the SAR-CoV-2 vaccine are rapidly expanding. This mini review briefly introduces the current antiviral therapy for COVID-19.

TI  - Concurrent coronavirus disease 2019 and primary syphilis in a young man: A rare case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Introduction: The global rise of syphilis infections and the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are causes for concern. We herein report a rare case of concurrent primary syphilis and COVID-19.Case report: A 29-year-old man was admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Although COVID-19 pneumonia appeared during ciclesonide and favipiravir treatment, his symptoms improved without developing severe hypoxemia. A small, red ulcer on the left-side of his glans penis was noted and left inguinal lymph node swellings were detected on computed tomography (CT). He reported that his last engagement in sexual intercourse had been 3 months previously, and that his partner had subsequently been diagnosed with syphilis. Although both serum Treponema pallidum (TP) antibody and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) quantitative tests were negative on the day of admission, we clinically diagnosed a suspected case of primary syphilis and started treatment with amoxicillin (1500 mg/day). We subsequently learned that the TP antibody and RPR quantitative tests had been positive 4 days before starting syphilis treatment. Amoxicillin treatment was continued for 61 days, and the ulcer gradually improved. One year later, the RPR quantitative test was negative, and CT revealed a reduction in size of the inguinal lymph nodes and no residual signs of COVID-19 pneumonia.Conclusion: The prevalence of syphilis has been increasing even during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the inci-dence of concurrent syphilis and COVID-19 might be higher than is recognized. Asking patients with COVID-19 about high-risk sexual behavior and genital lesions could help with early diagnosis of syphilis.

TI  - Favipiravir versus other antiviral or standard of care for COVID-19 treatment: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - VIROLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Background The COVID-19 causing coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus that utilizes an enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase for its replication. Favipiravir (FVP) triphosphate, a purine nucleoside analog, inhibits that enzyme. We have conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy and safety of the drug FVP as a treatment for COVID-19. Methods Databases like Pubmed, Pubmed Central, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, preprint sites, and clinicaltirals.gov were searched. The studies with the standard of care (SOC) and FVP as a treatment drug were considered as the treatment group and the SOC with other antivirals and supportive care as the control group. Quantitative synthesis was done using RevMan 5.4. Clinical improvement, negative conversion of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), adverse effects, and oxygen requirements were studied. Results We identified a total of 1798 studies after searching the electronic databases. Nine in the qualitative studies and four studies in the quantitative synthesis met the criteria. There was a significant clinical improvement in the FVP group on the 14th day compared to the control group (RR 1.29, 1.08-1.54). Clinical deterioration rates were less likely in the FVP group though statistically not significant (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.30-1.14) at the endpoint of study (7-15 days). The meta-analysis showed no significant differences between the two groups on viral clearance (day 14: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84-1.33), non-invasive ventilation or oxygen requirement (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.42-1.39), and adverse effects (OR 0.69, 0.13-3.57). There are 31 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) registered in different parts of the world focusing FVP for COVID-19 treatment. Conclusion There is a significant clinical and radiological improvement following treatment with FVP in comparison to the standard of care with no significant differences on viral clearance, oxygen support requirement and side effect profiles.

TI  - COVID-19: molecular pathophysiology, genetic evolution and prospective therapeutics-a review
T2  - ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic is highly contagious and has spread rapidly across the globe. To date there have been no specific treatment options available for this life-threatening disease. During this medical emergency, target-based drug repositioning/repurposing with a continuous monitoring and recording of results is an effective method for the treatment and drug discovery. This review summarizes the recent findings on COVID-19, its genomic organization, molecular evolution through phylogenetic analysis and has recapitulated the drug targets by analyzing the viral molecular machinery as drug targets and repurposing of most frequently used drugs worldwide and their therapeutic applications in COVID-19. Data from solidarity trials have shown that the treatment with Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir had no effect in reducing the mortality rate and also had adverse side effects. Remdesivir, Favipiravir and Ribavirin might be a safer therapeutic option for COVID-19. Recent clinical trial has revealed that dexamethasone and convalescent plasma treatment can reduce mortality in patients with severe forms of COVID-19.

TI  - A cell-based assay to discover inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase
T2  - ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH
AB  - Antiviral therapeutics is one effective avenue to control and end this devastating COVID-19 pandemic. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 has been recognized as a valuable target of antivirals. However, the cell-free SARS-CoV-2 RdRp biochemical assay requires the conversion of nucleotide prodrugs into the active triphosphate forms, which regularly occurs in cells yet is a complicated multiple-step chemical process in vitro, and thus hinders the utility of this cell-free assay in the rapid discovery of RdRp inhibitors. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 exoribonuclease provides the proof-reading capacity to viral RdRp, thus creates relatively high resistance threshold of viral RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors, which must be examined and evaluated in the development of this class of antivirals. Here, we report a cell-based assay to evaluate the efficacy of nucleotide analog compounds against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and assess their tolerance to viral exoribonuclease-mediated proofreading. By testing seven commonly used nucleotide analog viral polymerase inhibitors, Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, Ribavirin, Favipiravir, Penciclovir, Entecavir and Tenofovir, we found that both Molnupiravir and Remdesivir showed the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with EC50 value of 0.22 mu M and 0.67 mu M, respectively. Moreover, our results suggested that exoribonuclease nsp14 increases resistance of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors. We also determined that Remdesivir presented the highest resistance to viral exoribonuclease activity in cells. Therefore, we have developed a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 RdRp assay which can be deployed to discover SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors that are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 patients.

TI  - The effect of favipiravir versus hydroxychloroquine on clinical and laboratory findings in COVID-19 in healthcare workers
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Objectives: Comparative data on hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir, commonly used agents in the treatment of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), are still limited. In this study, it was aimed to compare treatment outcomes in healthcare workers with COVID-19 who were prospectively followed by the occupational health and safety unit.
   Methods: A total of 237 healthcare-workers, diagnosed as mild or moderate COVID-19 between March 11, 2020 and January 1, 2021, were given hydroxychloroquine (n = 114) or favipiravir (n = 123). Clinical and laboratory findings were evaluated.
   Results: The mean age of the patients was 33.4 +/- 11.5 years. The mean time to negative PCR was found to be significantly shorter in patients receiving favipiravir compared to the hydroxychloroquine group (10.9 vs. 13.9 days; p < 0.001). The rate of hospitalization in the hydroxychloroquine group was significantly higher than favipiravir group (15.8% vs. 3.3%). In terms of side effects; the frequency of diarrhea in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine was significantly higher than that in the favipiravir group (31.6% vs. 6.5%; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine were similar in terms of improvement of clinical symptoms of healthcare workers with mild or moderate COVID-19 infection, but favipiravir was significantly more effective in reducing viral load and hospitalization rates. Furthermore, favipiravir caused significantly less side-effects than hydroxychloroquine. (C) 2022 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI  - An overview of antiviral strategies for coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with special reference to antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - At present, neither specific antiviral drugs, nor vaccine is recommended for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. In this review we discuss the drugs suggested as therapy for COVID-19 infection, with a focus on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The list of drugs used for COVID-19 treatment includes a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, alpha-interferon, ribavirin, atazanavir, umifenovir, and tocilizumab. As their efficacy and safety are under investigation, none of the regulatory agencies approved them for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Although chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine possess antiviral and immunomodulatory effects, in practice benefit of their use for COVID-19 treatment is controversial. Several studies investigating hydroxychloroquine were stopped and the French national medicines regulator suspended its use in clinical trials because of safety concerns. The results from the double-blind, randomised clinical trials, including large number of participants, will add better insight into the role of these two drugs as already available and affordable, antimalarial therapy. The ethical issue on emergency use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the settings of COVID-19 should be carefully managed, with adherence to the "monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions" (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial, as stated by the WHO. Potential shortage of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine on the market can be overbridged with regular prescriptions by medical doctors and national drug agency should ensure sufficient quantities of these drugs for standard indications.

TI  - Potential Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Therapeutics That Target the Post-Entry Stages of the Viral Life Cycle: A Comprehensive Review
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to challenge health care systems around the world. Scientists and pharmaceutical companies have promptly responded by advancing potential therapeutics into clinical trials at an exponential rate. Initial encouraging results have been realized using remdesivir and dexamethasone. Yet, the research continues so as to identify better clinically relevant therapeutics that act either as prophylactics to prevent the infection or as treatments to limit the severity of COVID-19 and substantially decrease the mortality rate. Previously, we reviewed the potential therapeutics in clinical trials that block the early stage of the viral life cycle. In this review, we summarize potential anti-COVID-19 therapeutics that block/inhibit the post-entry stages of the viral life cycle. The review presents not only the chemical structures and mechanisms of the potential therapeutics under clinical investigation, i.e., listed in clinicaltrials.gov, but it also describes the relevant results of clinical trials. Their anti-inflammatory/immune-modulatory effects are also described. The reviewed therapeutics include small molecules, polypeptides, and monoclonal antibodies. At the molecular level, the therapeutics target viral proteins or processes that facilitate the post-entry stages of the viral infection. Frequent targets are the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the viral proteases such as papain-like protease (PLpro) and main protease (M-pro). Overall, we aim at presenting up-to-date details of anti-COVID-19 therapeutics so as to catalyze their potential effective use in fighting the pandemic.

TI  - Role of ACE2 receptor and the landscape of treatment options from convalescent plasma therapy to the drug repurposing in COVID-19
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Since the first case reports in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic and took lives of > 8,35,000 people globally. This single-stranded RNA virus uses Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry into the host cell. Overexpression of ACE2 is mainly observed in hypertensive, diabetic and heart patients that make them prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mitigations strategies were opted globally by the governments to minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the implementation of social distancing norms, wearing the facemasks, and spreading awareness using digital platforms. The lack of an approved drug treatment regimen, and non-availability of a vaccine, collectively posed a challenge for mankind to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this scenario, repurposing of existing drugs and old treatment options like convalescent plasma therapy can be one of the potential alternatives to treat the disease. The drug repurposing provides a selection of drugs based on the scientific rationale and with a shorter cycle of clinical trials, while plasma isolated from COVID-19 recovered patients can be a good source of neutralizing antibody to provide passive immunity. In this review, we provide in-depth analysis on these two approaches currently opted all around the world to treat COVID-19 patients. For this, we used "Boolean Operators" such as AND, OR & NOT to search relevant research articles/reviews from the PUBMED for the repurposed drugs and the convalescent plasma in the COVID-19 treatment. The repurposed drugs like Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Tenofovir, Remdesivir, Ribavirin, Darunavir, Oseltamivir, Arbidol (Umifenovir), Favipiravir, Anakinra, and Baricitinib are already being used in clinical trials to treat the COVID-19 patients. These drugs have been approved for a different indication and belong to a diverse category such as anti-malarial/anti-parasitic, anti-retroviral/anti-viral, anti-cancer, or against rheumatoid arthritis. Although, the vaccine would be an ideal option for providing active immunity against the SARS-CoV-2, but considering the current situation, drug repurposing and convalescent plasma therapy and repurposed drugs are the most viable option against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Incidence and risk factors for hyperkalaemia in patients treated for COVID-19 with nafamostat mesylate
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS
AB  - What is known and objective Nafamostat mesylate (NM) is used clinically in combination with antiviral drugs to treat coronavirus disease (COVID-19). One of the adverse events of NM is hyperkalaemia due to inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channels (ENaC). The incidence and risk factors for hyperkalaemia due to NM have been studied in patients with pancreatitis but not in COVID-19. COVID-19 can be associated with hypokalaemia or hyperkalaemia, and SARS-CoV-2 is thought to inhibit ENaC. Therefore, frequency and risk factors for hyperkalaemia due to NM may differ between COVID-19 and pancreatitis. Hyperkalaemia may worsen the respiratory condition of patients. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors for hyperkalaemia in COVID-19 patients treated with favipiravir, dexamethasone and NM. Methods This retrospective study reviewed the records of hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with favipiravir and dexamethasone, with or without NM, between March 2020 and January 2021. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for hyperkalaemia. Results and Discussion Of 45 patients who received favipiravir and dexamethasone with NM for the treatment of COVID-19, 21 (47%) experienced hyperkalaemia. The duration of NM administration was a significant predictor of hyperkalaemia (odds ratio: 1.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-2.31, p = 0.031). The receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis determined that the cut-off value for predicting the number of days until the onset of hyperkalaemia was 6 days and the area under the curve was 0.707. What is new and conclusion This study revealed that the incidence of hyperkalaemia is high in patients treated for COVID-19 with NM, and that the duration of NM administration is a key risk factor. When NM is administered for the treatment of COVID-19, it should be discontinued within 6 days to minimize the risk of hyperkalaemia.

TI  - Drug Fever Due to Favipiravir Administration for the Treatment of a COVID-19 Patient
T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - A 55-year-old Japanese man was hospitalized with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On the 14th day after the start of favipiravir administration, the patient developed a fever with a temperature of 38.1 degrees C. His pulse rate also became elevated to 128 bpm, so relative bradycardia was not suspected. Since he was in good overall health and no concomitant symptoms and signs were apparent, we considered it to be drug fever due to favipiravir. After the completion of favipiravir treatment, the patient's temperature normalized within 24 hours. We herein report this case of drug fever caused by favipiravir.

TI  - New Analogues of Uridine as Possible Anti-Viral Agents Specific to SARS-CoV-2
T2  - MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB  - The development of specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection is a major challenge facing global science and healthcare. Despite numerous attempts, there are still no truly effective drugs. Currently, the main approach in the creation of drugs against COVID-19 is repurposing, i.e., re-profiling existing drugs approved for medical use, for example, the use of a drug for the treatment of Ebola-Remdesivir, and the use of a drug for the treatment of influenza-Favipiravir. However, it is already obvious that these drugs are not specific enough nor effective enough. Another promising approach is the creation of new molecules, but it should be noted immediately that implementation requires much more time and costs. However, the search for new SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral agents continues. The aim of our work was the creation of new 5-substituted uridine derivatives as potential inhibitors of coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The substances were obtained in high yields by the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction and characterized using modern physicochemical methods. However, testing of their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 did not reveal a significant inhibitory effect.

TI  - Bioequivalence study of two favipiravir tablet formulations in healthy male subjects
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Objective: The global pandemic called COVID-19 has dragged the world into a healthcare crisis, and favipiravir is one of the most prescribed agents against the virus so far. Favipiravir is a repurposed antiviral agent in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to meet the current need, pharmaceutical companies are working for manufacturing licensed generic favipiravir. For getting the marketing authorization, the bioequivalence of the generic product must be proven first. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the bioequivalence of a new favipiravir tablet formulation as compared to the reference tablet formulation in healthy male subjects under fasting conditions. Materials and methods: To prove the bioequivalence, a randomized, single oral dose, cross-over, two-period study was carried out in 30 healthy subjects under fasting conditions. Plasma favipiravir levels were quantified by using an in-house-developed high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detector (LC-MSD) method. Results: The 90% CIs for the test/reference geometric mean ratios of the C-max and AUC(0-tlast) were 88.02 - 103.11% and 98.19 - 102.06%, respectively. Conclusion: This single-dose study has shown that the test and reference favipiravir products met the required bioequivalence criteria. Besides, both products were well tolerated and safe.

TI  - COVID-19: Characteristics and Therapeutics
T2  - CELLS
AB  - Novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2), which suddenly emerged in December 2019 is still haunting the entire human race and has affected not only the healthcare system but also the global socioeconomic balances. COVID-19 was quickly designated as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization as there have been about 98.0 million confirmed cases and about 2.0 million confirmed deaths, as of January 2021. Although, our understanding of COVID-19 has significantly increased since its outbreak, and multiple treatment approaches and pharmacological interventions have been tested or are currently under development to mitigate its risk-factors. Recently, some vaccine candidates showed around 95% clinical efficacy, and now receiving emergency use approvals in different countries. US FDA recently approved BNT162 and mRNA-1273 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Inc. for emergency use and vaccination in the USA. In this review, we present a succinct overview of the SARS-CoV-2 virus structure, molecular mechanisms of infection, COVID-19 epidemiology, diagnosis, and clinical manifestations. We also systematize different treatment strategies and clinical trials initiated after the pandemic outbreak, based on viral infection and replication mechanisms. Additionally, we reviewed the novel pharmacological intervention approaches and vaccine development strategies against COVID-19. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will trigger detailed studies of coronaviruses, their mechanism of infection, development of systematic drug repurposing approaches, and novel drug discoveries for current and future pandemic outbreaks.

TI  - A dynamic mucin mRNA signature associates with COVID-19 disease presentation and severity
T2  - JCI INSIGHT
AB  - BACKGROUND. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces mucin overexpression, further promoting disease. Given that mucins are critical components of innate immunity, unraveling their expression profiles that dictate the course of disease could greatly enhance our understanding and management of COVID-19. METHODS. Using validated RT-PCR assays, we assessed mucin mRNA expression in the blood of patients with symptomatic COVID-19 compared with symptomatic patients without COVID-19 and healthy controls and correlated the data with clinical outcome parameters. Additionally, we analyzed mucin expression in mucus and lung tissue from patients with COVID-19 and investigated the effect of drugs for COVID-19 treatment on SARS-CoV-2-induced mucin expression in pulmonary epithelial cells. RESULTS. We identified a dynamic blood mucin mRNA signature that clearly distinguished patients with symptomatic COVID-19 from patients without COVID-19 based on expression of MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC6, MUC13, MUC16, and MUC20 (AUCROC of 91.8%; sensitivity and specificity of 90.6% and 93.3%, respectively) and that discriminated between mild and critical COVID-19 based on the expression of MUC16, MUC20, and MUC21(AUCROC of 89.1%; sensitivity and specificity of 90.0% and 85.7%, respectively). Differences in the transcriptional landscape of mucins in critical cases compared with mild cases identified associations with COVID-19 symptoms, respiratory support, organ failure, secondary infections, and mortality. Furthermore, we identified different mucins in the mucus and lung tissue of critically ill COVID-19 patients and showed the ability of baricitinib, tocilizumab, favipiravir, and remdesivir to suppress expression of SARS-CoV-2-induced mucins. CONCLUSION. This multifaceted blood mucin mRNA signature showed the potential role of mucin profiling in diagnosing, estimating severity, and guiding treatment options in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and then spread rapidly all over the world. Scientists are intensifying their research efforts in order to find antivirals specific to the virus and vaccines to treat or prevent COVID-19. Now, for a medicative cure for COVID-19, several drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies. Convalescent plasma therapy and high dose of intravenous (IV) vitamin C have also been used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. This article outlines aspects related to several antiviral drugs and therapies which may be potentially effective against SARS-CoV-2.

T2  - JOURNAL OF DRUG TARGETING
AB  - A global outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected millions of people over a short period of time. The communicability and increased mortality from the SARS-CoV-2 infection mandated the WHO to declare COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. The virus outbreak has spread when there are no approved vaccines, treatments, or prophylactic therapies available. Researchers from all over the world have prioritised development of vaccines and antivirals. Several vaccine projects have seen successes in preclinical, phase I, and phase II clinical trials using recombinant DNA, mRNA, live attenuated virus, S-protein subunits, virus like particles, and viral vectors. Initial findings from antivirals such as remdesivir, favipiravir, danoprevir or lopinavir with ritonavir are presented. Immunomodulatory molecules such as sarilumab, tocilizumab, janus kinase inhibitors, and hyperimmune convalescent plasma have mixed outcomes from initial clinical findings; however, pending randomised controlled trials will assist national health institutions to make treatment recommendations for COVID-19. Where compassionate use of remdesivir has shown some benefits, therapies such as hydroxychloroquine have proven harmful due to their toxicities. This review discusses pharmacological interventions at play and evidence-based successes and limitations of non-pharmacological therapies such as social distancing, personal protective equipment, and ventilator support associated with the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

T2  - SYNTHESIS-STUTTGART
AB  - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease has rapidly evolved into a sweeping pandemic despite public health measures. Screening and development of new vaccines and antivirals are expensive and time consuming. However, the repositioning of available drugs is an essential and universal strategy in the development of new drugs and therefore should receive priority attention as well as international government and agency support. Significant drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and remdesivir, are currently undergoing clinical studies to test their efficacy and safety. Some promising results have been achieved thus far in the treatment of COVID-19. In this article we summarize and discuss the most common synthetic strategies to apply in the preparation of these drug molecules. It is hoped that this compendium will provide an accessible useful guide and reference source for scientists, researchers and academia in their battle against COVD-19.

TI  - A case of COVID-19 diagnosed with favipiravir-induced drug fever based on a positive drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - As of October 2020, there is still no specific drug to treat COVID-19 as it rages worldwide. Favipiravir, indicated for the treatment of new and re-emerging influenza infections, has been suggested to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, although this is not yet fully validated. We administered favipiravir to a 64 year-old female patient with COVID-19. Her symptoms resolved quickly after the start of treatment, with reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load, but she developed a fever again on day 12. Since the fever was relieved by discontinuation of favipiravir, and based on positive results with a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test, we diagnosed her with favipiravir-induced drug fever. A decrease in the serum concentration of favipiravir was observed along with resolution of the fever. The present case suggests that drug fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis of relapsing fever episodes in COVID-19 patients receiving favipiravir. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Evan syndrome as initial presentation of COVID-19 infection
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BRONCHOLOGY
AB  - Background Evans' syndrome (ES) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the concomitant or sequential association of auto-immune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and less frequently autoimmune neutropenia with a positive direct anti-human globulin test. ES represents up to 7% of AIHA and around 2% of ITP. Studies have found that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be associated with various hematological complications, i.e., coagulopathies; however, finding of Evans syndrome is a novel case. Case report A 54-year-old diabetic man complaining of fever (high grade), arthralgia and myalgia, fatigue, and dark color of urine. He was admitted to isolation sector at Sohag General Hospital on day 6 because of fever with cough, dyspnea, and progressive fatigue, and at admission, he was tachypneic, tachycardiac, jaundiced, febrile (38 degrees C), and hypoxemic (O2 saturations on room air was 80%). Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin (Hb) 5.43 g/dL, high reticulocyte (12.5%), down arrow ed platelet count (54 x 10(3)/mu l), hyperbilirubinemia and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase. Markers of autoimmune diseases and screening for malignant diseases were negative. HRCT chest showed bilateral small-sized peripheral ground glass opacities in both lungs, with positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab. Direct Coombs test was positive for immunoglobulin (IgG) and C3d. Evans syndrome secondary to COVID-19 was diagnosed and treatment with packed red cell (PRC) transfusions, favipiravir, dexamethasone, prednisone, ceftriaxone, enoxaparin, oral hypoglycemic, and oxygen using face mask, and then Hb value increased to 10.3 g/dL and he was discharged home without any complications. Conclusion There are few reports of patients with concurrent COVID-19 and Evans syndrome. So, SARS-CoV-2 infection should be considered in any patient presenting with new-onset ES of unclear etiology.

TI  - A Review of SARS-CoV-2 and the Ongoing Clinical Trials
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - The sudden outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, which rapidly grew into a global pandemic, marked the third introduction of a virulent coronavirus into the human society, affecting not only the healthcare system, but also the global economy. Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.

TI  - Review on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic: Its outbreak and current status
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Background: In late December 2019 and on 1st January 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) infecting humans was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Later cases have also been confirmed worldwide. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that are phenotypically and genotypically diverse. Globally, as of 6th April 2020, laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) amounted to 1 211 214, including 67 666 deaths.
   Aim: In the current study, we performed a literature review on coronavirus outbreak to summarise details about the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis and the management strategies for the disease control.
   Pathogenesis: Coronaviruses are tremendously precise and mature only in differentiated respiratory epithelial cells, as seen in both organ cultures as well as human volunteers. This virus will cause the antiviral T-cell response to be erratic, owing to the T-cell apoptosis activation, triggering the immune system to collapse.
   Transmission: The understanding of the transmission of COVID-19 risk is incomplete. The transmission mainly occurs through the respiratory droplets once an infected person sneezes, like the spread of flu and other respiratory infectious agents.
   Clinical presentation: Presentations of COVID-19 includes fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise and respiratory distress.
   Treatment: There have been no approved vaccines available for COVID-19 until today. The Ministry of Science and Technology in the People's Republic of China declared three potential antiviral medicines suitable for treating COVID-19. Those three medicines are, namely, favilavir, chloroquine phosphate and remdesivir. Hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin enhances the reduction of the viral load in COVID-19 patients.
   Conclusion: The corona virus transmits quicker than its two predecessors the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has reduced casualty. The global effects of this latest pandemic are still unclear. Nevertheless, considering that so far no vaccine has been available; preventive approaches are the best way to fight against the virus.

TI  - Multi-target potential of Indian phytochemicals against SARS-CoV-2: A docking, molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA approach extended to Omicron B.1.1.529.
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: SARS-CoV-2, an emerged strain of corona virus family became almost serious health concern worldwide. Despite vaccines availability, reports suggest the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection even in a vaccinated population. With frequent evolution and expected multiple COVID-19 waves, improved preventive, diagnostic, and treatment measures are required. In recent times, phytochemicals have gained attention due to their therapeutic characteristics and are suggested as alternative and complementary treatments for infectious diseases. This present study aimed to identify potential inhibitors against reported protein targets of SARS-CoV-2.Methodology: We computationally investigated potential SARS-CoV-2 protein targets from the literature and collected druggable phytochemicals from Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry and Therapeutics (IMPPAT) database. Further, we implemented a systematic workflow of molecular docking, dynamic simulations and generalized born surface area free-energy calculations (MM-GBSA).Results: Extensive literature search and assessment of 1508 articles identifies 13 potential SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. We screened 501 druggable phytochemicals with proven biological activities. Analysis of 6513(501 *13) docked phytochemicals complex, 26 were efficient against SARS-CoV-2. Amongst, 4,8-dihydroxysesamin and arboreal from Gmelina arborea were ranked potential against most of the targets with binding energy ranging between - 10.7 to - 8.2 kcal/mol. Additionally, comparative docking with known drugs such as arbidol (-6.6 to -5.1 kcal/mol), favipiravir (-5.5 to -4.5 kcal/mol), hydroxychloroquine (-6.5 to -5.1 kcal/mol), and remedesivir (-8.0 to -5.3 kcal/mol) revealed equal/less affinity than 4,8-dihydroxysesamin and arboreal. Interestingly, the nucleocapsid target was found commonly inhibited by 4,8-dihydroxysesamin and arboreal. Molecular dynamic simulation and Molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA)calculations reflect that both the compounds possess high inhibiting potential against SARS-CoV-2 including the recently emerged Omicron variant (B.1.1.529).

TI  - COVID-19 pandemic: an overview of epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostics and potential vaccines and therapeutics
T2  - THERAPEUTIC DELIVERY
AB  - At the time of writing this review, severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 2,355,853 patients and resulted in more than 164,656 deaths worldwide (as of 20 April 2020). This review highlights the preventive measures, available clinical therapies and the potential of vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 by taking into consideration the strong genetic similarities of the 2003 epidemic SARS-CoV. Recent studies are investigating the repurposing of US FDA-approved drugs as there is no available vaccine yet with many attempts under clinical evaluation. Several antivirals, antimalarials and immunomodulators that have shown activity against SARS-CoV and Middle East coronavirus respiratory syndromes are being evaluated. In particular, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, arbidol, tocilizumab and bevacizumab have shown promising results. The main aim of this review is to provide an overview of this pandemic and where we currently stand.

TI  - Favipiravir Use in COVID-19: Analysis of Suspected Adverse Drug Events Reported in the WHO Database
T2  - INFECTION AND DRUG RESISTANCE
AB  - Background: COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged as an unprecedented challenge to discover effective drugs for its prevention and cure. Hyperinflammation-induced lung damage is one of the poor prognostic indicators causing a higher rate of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. Favipiravir, an antiviral drug, is being used for COVID-19 treatment, and we currently have limited information regarding its efficacy and safety. Thus, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the adverse drug events (ADEs) reported in the WHO pharmacovigilance database.
   Methods: This study analyzed all suspected ADEs related to favipiravir reported from 2015. The reports were analyzed based on age, gender, and seriousness of ADEs at the System Organ Classification (SOC) level and the individual Preferred Term (PT) level.
   Results: This study is based on 194 ADEs reported from 93 patients. Most frequent ADEs suspected to be caused by the favipiravir included increased hepatic enzymes, nausea and vomiting, tachycardia, and diarrhea. Severe and fatal ADEs occurred more frequently in men and those over the age of 64 years. Blood and lymphatic disorders, cardiac disorders, hepatobiliary disorders, injury poisoning, and procedural complications were more common manifestations of severe ADEs.
   Conclusion: This study revealed that favipiravir appears to be a relatively safe drug. An undiscovered anti-inflammatory activity of favipiravir may explain the improvement in critically ill patients and reduce inflammatory markers. Currently, the data is based on very few patients. A more detailed assessment of the uncommon ADEs needs to be analyzed when more information will be available.

TI  - Feasibility of Known RNA Polymerase Inhibitors as Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Drugs
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-stranded RNA viruses that infect humans and animals. Infection by CoVs such as HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43 and -HKU1 leads to the common cold, short lasting rhinitis, cough, sore throat and fever. However, CoVs such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the newest SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) lead to severe and deadly diseases with mortality rates ranging between similar to 1 to 35% depending on factors such as age and pre-existing conditions. Despite continuous global health threats to humans, there are no approved vaccines or drugs targeting human CoVs, and the recent outbreak of COVID-19 emphasizes an urgent need for therapeutic interventions. Using computational and bioinformatics tools, here we present the feasibility of reported broad-spectrum RNA polymerase inhibitors as anti- SARS-CoV-2 drugs targeting its main RNA polymerase, suggesting that investigational and approved nucleoside RNA polymerase inhibitors have potential as anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. However, we note that it is also possible for SARS-CoV-2 to evolve and acquire drug resistance mutations against these nucleoside inhibitors.

TI  - Favipiravir Effectiveness and Safety in Hospitalized Moderate-Severe COVID-19 Patients: Observational Prospective Multicenter Investigation in Saudi Arabia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - ObjectivesThere are limited data on the efficacy and safety of favipiravir antiviral in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly in the more progressed disease phase. This study aims to evaluate the favipiravir effect on reducing the length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality among moderate and severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients. MethodsA prospective, multicenter observational study was conducted that included moderate and severe hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients in four major regions (Riyadh (Riyadh), Eastern (Dammam), Al-Qassem (Buraydah), and Macca (Jeddah) of Saudi Arabia. For the primary outcome of all-cause mortality, a Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed. While the association between favipiravir use and length of hospital stay was determined using adjusted generalized linear model. This study was approved by the Central Institutional Review Board in The Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) with the approval number IRB # 20-85-M. ResultsThis study included 598 moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, of whom 156 (26%) received favipiravir. Favipiravir treatment was associated with more extended hospital stays (14 vs. 10 median days, P = 0.034) and higher mortality rate (aHR 3.63; 95% CI 1.06-12.45) compared to no favipiravir regimen. Despite lack of effectiveness, favipiravir use was only associated with higher diarrhea adverse effects (12 vs. 5%, P = 0.002), but it did not affect the renal and liver profiles of patients. ConclusionFavipiravir was ineffective in reducing the length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as a therapeutic target for COVID-19
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON THERAPEUTIC PATENTS
AB  - Introduction: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic urgently demands for both prevention and treatment strategies. RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), which has no counterpart in human cells, is an excellent target for drug development. Given the time-consuming process of drug development, repurposing drugs approved for other indications or at least successfully tested in terms of safety and tolerability, is an attractive strategy to rapidly provide an effective medication for severe COVID-19 cases.
   Areas covered: The currently available data and upcoming studies on RdRp which can be repurposed to halt SARS-CoV-2 replication, are reviewed.
   Expert opinion: Drug repurposing and design of novel compounds are proceeding in parallel to provide a quick response and new specific drugs, respectively. Notably, the proofreading SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease activity could limit the potential for drugs designed as immediate chain terminators and favor the development of compounds acting through delayed termination. While vaccination is awaited to curb the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, even partially effective drugs from repurposing strategies can be of help to treat severe cases of disease. Considering the high conservation of RdRp among coronaviruses, an improved knowledge of its activity in vitro can provide useful information for drug development or drug repurposing to combat SARS-CoV-2 as well as future pandemics.

AB  - The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a large increase in mortality and morbidity associated with respiratory diseases. Huge efforts are currently ongoing to develop a vaccine against this virus. However, alternative approaches could be considered in the fight against this disease. Among other strategies, structural-based drug design could be an effective approach to generate specific molecules against SARS-CoV-2, thus reducing viral burden in infected patients. Here, in addition to this structural approach, we also revise several therapeutic strategies to fight against this viral threat. Furthermore, we report ACE-2 genetic polymorphic variants affecting residues involved in close contacts with SARS-CoV-2 that might be associated to different infection risks. These analyses could provide valuable information to predict the course of the disease.

TI  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19: possible mechanisms and therapeutic management
T2  - PNEUMONIA
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic is a serious concern in the new era. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and lung failure are the main lung diseases in COVID-19 patients. Even though COVID-19 vaccinations are available now, there is still an urgent need to find potential treatments to ease the effects of COVID-19 on already sick patients. Multiple experimental drugs have been approved by the FDA with unknown efficacy and possible adverse effects. Probably the increasing number of studies worldwide examining the potential COVID-19 related therapies will help to identification of effective ARDS treatment. In this review article, we first provide a summary on immunopathology of ARDS next we will give an overview of management of patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit (ICU), while focusing on the current treatment strategies being evaluated in the clinical trials in COVID-19-induced ARDS patients.

TI  - The Rationale for Potential Pharmacotherapy of COVID-19
T2  - PHARMACEUTICALS
AB  - On 11 March 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.

TI  - Repositioning HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Aims SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus which is part of the ss-coronavirus family (like SARS 2002 and MERS 2012). The high prevalence of hospitalization and mortality, in addition to the lack of vaccines and therapeutics, forces scientists and clinicians around the world to evaluate new therapeutic options. One strategy is the repositioning of already known drugs, which were approved drugs for other indications.
   Subject and method SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors seem to be valuable targets of research. At the beginning of the pandemic, the webpage listed n=479 clinical trials related to the antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (01.04.2020, "SARS-CoV-2," "COVID-19," "antivirals," "therapy"), of which n=376 are still accessible online in January 2021 (10.01.2021). Taking into account further studies not listed in the CTG webpage, this narrative review appraises HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors as promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.
   Results Lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, remdesivir, tenofovir-disoproxilfumarate, favipriravir, and sofosbuvir are evaluated in clinical studies worldwide. Study designs show a high variability and results often are contradictory. Remdesivir is the drug, which is deployed in nearly 70% of the reviewed clinical trials, followed by lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, ribavirine, and sofosbuvir.
   Discussion This review discusses the pharmacological/clinical background and questions the rationale and study design of clinical trials with already approved HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors which are repositioned during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic worldwide. Proposals are made for future study design and drug repositioning of approved antiretroviral compounds.

TI  - Drug repurposing for identification of potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain: An in silico approach
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background & objectives: The world is currently under the threat of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, caused by SARS-CoV-2. The objective of the present investigation was to repurpose the drugs with potential antiviral activity against receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein among 56 commercially available drugs. Therefore, an integrative computational approach, using molecular docking, quantum chemical calculation and molecular dynamics, was performed to unzip the effective drug-target interactions between RBD and 56 commercially available drugs.
   Methods: The present in silico approach was based on information of drugs and experimentally derived crystal structure of RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Molecular docking analysis was performed for RBD against all 56 reported drugs using AutoDock 4.2 tool to screen the drugs with better potential antiviral activity which were further analysed by other computational tools for repurposing potential drug or drugs for COVID-19 therapeutics.
   Results: Drugs such as chalcone, grazoprevir, enzaplatovir, dolutegravir, daclatasvir, tideglusib, presatovir, remdesivir and simeprevir were predicted to be potentially effective antiviral drugs against RBD and could have good COVID-19 therapeutic efficacy. Simeprevir displayed the highest binding affinity and reactivity against RBD with the values of-8.52 kcal/mol (binding energy) and 9.254 kcal/mol (band energy gap) among all the 56 drugs under investigation.
   Interpretation & conclusions: In the current investigation, simeprevir was identified as the potential antiviral drug based on the in silico findings in comparison to remdesivir, favipiravir and other 53 drugs. Further, laboratory and clinical investigations are needed to be carried out which will aid in the development of quick therapeutics designed for COVID-19.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of four drug regimens versus standard-of-care for the treatment of symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19: A randomised, open-label, multi-arm, phase 2 clinical trial
T2  - EBIOMEDICINE
AB  - Background This exploratory study investigated four repurposed anti-infective drug regimens in outpatients with COVID-19.
   Methods This phase 2, single centre, randomised, open-label, clinical trial was conducted in South Africa between 3rd September 2020 and 23rd August 2021. Symptomatic outpatients aged 18-65 years, with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were computer randomised (1:1:1:1:1) to standard-of-care (SOC) with paracetamol, or SOC plus artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), pyronaridine-artesunate (PA), favipiravir plus nitazoxanide (FPV + NTZ), or sofosbuvir-daclatasvir (SOF-DCV). The primary endpoint was the incidence of viral clearance, i.e., the proportion of patients with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on day 7, compared to SOC using a log-binomial model in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population.
   Findings The mITT population included 186 patients: mean age (SD) 34.9 (10.3) years, body weight 78.2 (17.1) kg. Day 7 SARS-CoV-2 clearance rates (n/N; risk ratio [95% CI]) were: SOC 34.2% (13/38), ASAQ 38.5% (15/39; 0.80 [0.44, 1.47]), PA 30.3% (10/33; 0.69 [0.37, 1.29]), FPV + NTZ 27.0% (10/37; 0.60 [0.31, 1.18]) and SOF-DCV 23.5% (8/34; 0.47 [0.22, 1.00]). Three lower respiratory tract infections occurred (PA 6.1% [2/33]; SOF-DCV 2.9% [1/34]); two required hospitalisation (PA, SOF-DCV). There were no deaths. Adverse events occurred in 55.3% (105/190) of patients, including one serious adverse event (pancytopenia; FPV + NTZ).
   Interpretation There was no statistical difference in viral clearance for any regimen compared to SOC. All treatments were well tolerated. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A review of cardiovascular involvements associated with medications used to treat COVID-19 infection
T2  - COR ET VASA
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly across the world and is introduced as a global health crisis. COVID-19 is one of the threatening pandemics in history involving many organs, including the cardiovascular system. The cardiovascular involvements, such as myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, dysrhythmias, and heart failure, have been reported in the COVID-19 patients. Currently, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19; though, some therapies such as interferon, remdesivir, ribavirin, favipiravir, and tocilizumab are being used. The medications used to treat COVID-19 may have cardiovascular adverse events or interact with some cardiovascular drugs. The most concerning conditions caused by these medications are QTc prolongation and torsades de pointes (TdP), which might cause abrupt death. Here, we describe cardiac adverse effects and potential interactions of COVID-19 medications with cardiovascular agents.

TI  - Evaluation of Changing Drug Preferences During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Tertiary Childrens Hospital
T2  - JOURNAL OF DR BEHCET UZ CHILDRENS HOSPITAL
AB  - Objective: There is currently no drug that is effective against the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and no consensus was present regarding the treatment. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to evaluate the progress of the treatment process of patients with COVID-19 since the first day of pandemic in our country and the changes in the process.Method: This single-center cross-sectional study was conducted from March 11 through November 30, 2020, in University of Health Sciences Turkey, Dr. Behcet Uz Pediatric Diseases and Surgery Training and Research Hospital, a 400-bed tertiary care hospital in Izmir, Turkey. Treatment options in all hospitalized children with COVID-19 were evaluated.Results: Evaluation of our clinical treatment algorithm from March to December, it was seen that the majority of the patients did not need any specific treatment and recovered only with supportive treatment. Because of the recommendations of the COVID-19 guidelines, no efficacy has been detected during the oseltamivir treatment and there was a significant decrease in use of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. Favipiravir is still the first choice of drug for patients with COVI D-19.Conclusion: World Health Organization, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and Surviving Sepsis guidelines indicate that their investigational treatments should only be used in certain clinical trial setting. Supportive care is still the main therapeutic option in COVI D-19.

TI  - An Update on Antiviral Therapy Against SARS-CoV-2: How Far Have We Come?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide at an exponential rate affecting millions of people instantaneously. Currently, various drugs are under investigation to treat an enormously increasing number of COVID-19 patients. This dreadful situation clearly demands an efficient strategy to quickly identify drugs for the successful treatment of COVID-19. Hence, drug repurposing is an effective approach for the rapid discovery of frontline arsenals to fight against COVID-19. Successful application of this approach has resulted in the repurposing of some clinically approved drugs as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates. Several of these drugs are either antimalarials, antivirals, antibiotics or corticosteroids and they have been repurposed based on their potential to negate virus or reduce lung inflammation. Large numbers of clinical trials have been registered to evaluate the effectiveness and clinical safety of these drugs. Till date, a few clinical studies are complete and the results are primary. WHO also conducted an international, multi-country, open-label, randomized trials-a solidarity trial for four antiviral drugs. However, solidarity trials have few limitations like no placebos were used, additionally any drug may show effectiveness for a particular population in a region which may get neglected in solidarity trial analysis. The ongoing randomized clinical trials can provide reliable long-term follow-up results that will establish both clinical safety and clinical efficacy of these drugs with respect to different regions, populations and may aid up to worldwide COVID-19 treatment research. This review presents a comprehensive update on majorly repurposed drugs namely chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, favipiravir, ribavirin, azithromycin, umifenovir, oseltamivir as well as convalescent plasma therapy used against SARS-CoV-2. The review also summarizes the data recorded on the mechanism of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of these repurposed drugs along with the preclinical and clinical findings, therapeutic regimens, pharmacokinetics, and drug-drug interactions.

TI  - A comparative analysis for anti-viral drugs: Their efficiency against SARS-CoV-2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Coronavirus, known as the coronavirus pandemic, is continuing its spread across the world, with over 42 million confirmed cases in 189 countries and more than 1.15 million deaths. Although, scientists focus on the finding novel drugs and vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, there is no certain treatment for it. Antiviral drugs such as; oseltamivir, favipiravir, umifenovir, lopinavir, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, are mostly used for patients. They prevent cytokine storm that is the main reason of deaths related to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, anti-inflammatory agents have critical roles to inhibit the lung injury and multisystem organ dysfunction. The combination with anti-viral drugs with other drugs displays high synergistic effects. In the present study, the drugs used for Covid-19 are analyzed and compare the efficiency for the Covid-19 patients from the different continents including USA, South Korea, Italy, Spain, Germany, Russia, Brazil, Turkey, and China. Nowadays, all countries tried to find vaccine and new drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2, but anti-viral drugs may be the best candidates for the treatment of Covid-19 before finding novel anti-Covid drug.

TI  - COVID-19: Review of a 21st Century Pandemic from Etiology to Neuro-psychiatric Implications
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - COVID-19 is a severe infectious disease that has claimed >150,000 lives and infected millions in the United States thus far, especially the elderly population. Emerging evidence has shown the virus to cause hemorrhagic and immunologic responses, which impact all organs, including lungs, kidneys, and the brain, as well as extremities. SARS-CoV-2 also affects patients', families', and society's mental health at large. There is growing evidence of re-infection in some patients. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, its mechanism of infection, diagnostics, therapeutics, and treatment strategies, while also focusing on less attended aspects by previous studies, including nutritional support, psychological, and rehabilitation of the pandemic and its management. We performed a systematic review of >1,000 articles and included 425 references from online databases, including, PubMed, Google Scholar, and California Baptist University's library. COVID-19 patients go through acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, acute hypercoagulable state, and autonomic dysfunction, which must be managed by a multidisciplinary team including nursing, nutrition, and rehabilitation. The elderly population and those who are suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia related illnesses seem to be at the higher risk. There are 28 vaccines under development, and new treatment strategies/protocols are being investigated. The future management for COVID-19 should include B-cell and T-cell immunotherapy in combination with emerging prophylaxis. The mental health and illness aspect of COVID-19 are among the most important side effects of this pandemic which requires a national plan for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Plant-Derived Natural Non-Nucleoside Analog Inhibitors (NNAIs) against RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Complex (nsp7/nsp8/nsp12) of SARS-CoV-2
T2  - JOURNAL OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS
AB  - The emergence of fast-spreading SARS-CoV-2 mutants has sparked a new phase of COVID-19 pandemic. There is a dire necessity for antivirals targeting highly conserved genomic domains on SARS-CoV-2 that are less prone to mutation. The nsp12, also known as the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), the core component of 'SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex', is a potential well-conserved druggable antiviral target. Several FDA-approved RdRp 'nucleotide analog inhibitors (NAIs)' such as remdesivir, have been repurposed to treat COVID-19 infections. The NAIs target RdRp protein translation and competitively block the nucleotide insertion into the RNA chain, resulting in the inhibition of viral replication. However, the replication proofreading function of nsp14-ExoN could provide resistance to SARS-CoV-2 against many NAIs. Conversely, the 'non-nucleoside analog inhibitors (NNAIs)' bind to allosteric sites on viral polymerase surface, change the redox state; thereby, exert antiviral activity by altering interactions between the enzyme substrate and active core catalytic site of the RdRp. NNAIs neither require metabolic activation (unlike NAIs) nor compete with intracellular pool of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) for anti-RdRp activity. The NNAIs from phytonutrient origin are potential antiviral candidates compared to their synthetic counterparts. Several in-silico studies reported the antiviral spectrum of natural phytonutrient-NNAIs such as Suramin, Silibinin (flavonolignan), Theaflavin (tea polyphenol), Baicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone), Corilagin (gallotannin), Hesperidin (citrus bioflavonoid), Lycorine (pyrrolidine alkaloid), with superior redox characteristics (free binding energy, hydrogen-bonds, etc.) than antiviral drugs (i.e. remdesivir, favipiravir). These phytonutrient-NNAIs also exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and cardioprotective functions, with multifunctional therapeutic benefits in the clinical management of COVID-19.

TI  - The comparison of favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir combination in COVID-19 treatment
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background/aim: SARS-CoV-2, a ribonucleic acid coronavirus, rapidly spread worldwide within a short timeframe. Although different antiviral, antiinflammatory, and immunomodulatory drugs are used, current evidence is insufficient as to which drug is more efficient. Our study compared favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) therapies in inpatient care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Materials and methods: Demographic data, test results, treatments, and latest status of patients receiving inpatient COVID-19 pneumonia therapy were recorded. The initial favipiravir and LPV/RTV receiving groups were compared regarding the need for intensive care units (ICU) and mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed by including variables showing significant differences as a result of paired comparisons into the model. Results: Of the 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 59 (28.9%), 131 (64.2%), and 14 were administered LPV/RTV, favipiravir, and favipiravir with LPV/RTV, respectively. No difference was found in age, sex, presence of comorbidity, and tocilizumab, systemic corticosteroid, and plasma therapy use between patients administered with these three different treatment regimens. The mean mortality age of the patients was 71 +/- 14.3 years, which was substantially greater than that of the survivors (54.2 +/- 15.5 years). Compared with patients administered with LPV/RTV, ICU admission and mortality rates were lower in patients administered with favipiravir. CK-MB, AST, CRP, LDH, and creatinine levels were higher, whereas lymphocyte counts were lower in patients who died. Age, AST, CRP, LDH, and neutrophil counts were higher in patients needing ICU, and eosinophil and lymphocyte counts were significantly lower. Logistic regression analysis showed that favipiravir use independently decreased mortality (p = 0.006). Conclusion: The use of favipiravir was more effective than LPV/RTV in reducing mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Macroalgae Bioactive Compounds for the Potential Antiviral of SARS-CoV-2: An In Silico Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was due to novel coronavirus was detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China for the first time and spread rapidly became a global pandemic. This study aimed to predict the potential of macroalgae compounds as SARS-CoV-2 antiviral by inhibiting of ACE2 receptor through in silico approach. Twenty-seven macroalgae compounds were obtained from PubChem (NCBI, USA), while target protein ACE2 receptor was collected from Protein Data Bank (PDB). Then the initial screening study drug-likeness conducted by Lipinski rule of five web server and prediction of bioactive probability carried out by PASS (Prediction of activity spectra for biologically active substances) Online web server. After those compounds were approved by Lipinski's rule of five and PASS online prediction web server, the blind docking simulation was performed using PyRx 0.8 software to show binding energy value. Molecular interaction analysis was done using BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2016 v16.1.0 and PyMOL v2.4.1 software. There are six macroalgae compounds approved by Lipinski's rule of five and PASS Online Analysis. The result is that macroalgae compound siphonaxanthin among 27 macroalgae compound showed strong binding energy to bind ACE2 receptor with -8.8 kcal/mol. This study also used the SARS-CoV-2 drugs as positive control: remdesivir, molnupiravir, baricitinib, lopinavir, oseltamivir, and favipiravir. The result shows that siphonaxanthin has lowest binding energy than the common SARS-CoV-2 drug. Macroalgae compounds are predicted to have potential as SARS-CoV-2 antiviral. Thus, extension studies need to investigate by in vitro and in vivo analysis for confirmation

TI  - Molecular Mechanism of Action of Repurposed Drugs and Traditional Chinese Medicine Used for the Treatment of Patients Infected With COVID-19: A Systematic Scoping Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Background: The emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic has resulted in the need for urgent development of vaccines and drugs and the conduction of clinical trials to fight the outbreak. Because of the time constraints associated with the development of vaccines and effective drugs, drug repurposing and other alternative treatment methods have been used to treat patients that have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have acquired COVID-19.
   Objective: The objective of this systematic scoping review is to provide an overview of the molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs or alternative treatment medicines used to attenuate COVID-19 disease.
   Method: The research articles or gray literature, including theses, government reports, and official news online, were identified from four databases and one search engine. The full content of a total of 160 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria was analyzed and information about six drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and chloroquine) and four Traditional Chinese Medicines (Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye, TCM combination of Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San and Da Yuan Yin, Xue Bi Jing Injection, and Qing Fei Pai Du Tang) was extracted.
   Results: All of the repurposed drugs and complementary medicine that have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 depend on the ability of the drug to inhibit the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by binding to enzyme active sites, viral chain termination, or triggering of the molecular pathway, whereas Traditional Chinese Medicine plays a pivotal role in triggering the inflammation pathway, such as the neuraminidase blocker, to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

TI  - Time to 'Mind the Gap' in novel small molecule drug discovery for direct-acting antivirals for SARS-CoV-2
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN VIROLOGY
AB  - A pipeline of effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) remains a critical gap in addressing the current pandemic given vaccination hesitancy, the emergence of viral variants of concern, susceptible populations for which vaccination is ineffective or unavailable, and the possibility that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is here to stay. Since the start of the pandemic, global efforts in small molecule drug discovery have focused largely on testing of FDA-approved drugs to accelerate evaluation in clinical trials in hospitalized patients. With 80% of the population who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 having asymptomatic to mild COVID-19, early stage, DAAs would be of enormous benefit to reduce spread, duration of symptoms and quarantine length. We highlight a few of the most promising DAAs in clinical trials and discuss considerations in how to navigate the challenges and pitfalls of novel small molecule discovery and thereby accelerate the advancement of new, safe, and oral DAAs.

TI  - Phase 3 trial of coronavir (favipiravir) in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
AB  - Favipiravir has demonstrated efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in several preliminary studies. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in outpatients and hospitalized patients. We conducted an open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial of a generic form of favipiravir in patients with COVID-19 confirmed by PCR-test. Eligible patients (18-60 years) after stratification were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive either favipiravir (1800 mg BID on day 1, followed by 800 mg BID for up to 9 days), or standard of care (SOC) treatment (umifenovir + intranasal interferon alpha-2b, or hydroxychloroquine) for up to 10 days. The co-primary outcomes were the time to clinical improvement and the time to viral clearance. Among 190 patients assessed for eligibility 168 were randomized to favipiravir (n=112) or to SOC (n=56) group. The median time to clinical improvement was 6.0 days (IQR 4.0; 9.3) in the favipiravir group and 10.0 (IQR 5.0; 21.0) days in the SOC group; the median difference was 4 days (HR 1.63; 95% CI 1.14-2.34; P=0.007). The statistically significant difference in the median time to viral clearance was observed only for hospitalized patients: 3.0 (IQR 3.0; 3.0) days in the favipiravir group vs. 5.0 (IQR 4.5; 5.5) days in the SOC group (HR 2.11; 95% CI 1.04-4.31; P=0.038). The rate of viral elimination on Day 5 in the favipiravir group was significantly higher than in SOC group: 81.2% vs. 67.9% (RR 1.22; 05% CI 1.00-1.48; P=0.022). The rate of clinical improvement on Day 7 in the favipiravir group was 1.5-fold higher than in SOC group: 52.7% vs. 35.8% (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.02-2.22; P=0.020). Favipiravir was well-tolerated and the most common adverse reactions were asymptomatic hyperuricemia, transient elevation of ALT & AST, and mild gastrointestinal disorders. Favipiravir was superior to the SOC in shortening the time to clinical improvement in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

TI  - COVID-19: Epidemiology, Pathology, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Impact
T2  - CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB  - The pandemic, well-known as COVID-19, has been caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and it has distinct characteristics from other coronavirus-related epidemics. This pandemic has been ravaging the whole world for more than a year now, and no drugs or vaccines have been found to eliminate this virus from the infected people effectively; only physical measures like social distancing, hand washing and face-mask wearing have been taken to reduce its spread and very recently Veklury (remdesivir) has been permitted by the USFDA to manage the critical patients. This disease can be asymptomatic, but when it is symptomatic, it presents with respiratory problems and cold-or flu-like symptoms, which can be diagnosed with a chest CT and confirmed with RT-PCR tests. In this review, the taxonomy and structure of SARS-CoV-2 and history, transmission, epidemiology, pathology, clinical features and impacts of the COVID-19 have been discussed. A summary of possible drug targets, attempted physical and chemical measures, as well as vaccine candidates, has also been provided. How this coronavirus is different from other coronaviruses, the obstacles in managing this disease and the possibility of a second wave have also been reviewed. This review represents a wide range of information regarding COVID-19 and intends to be used as a comprehensive overview in this regard.

TI  - Favipiravir in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNA recurrent positive after discharge: A multicenter, open-label, randomized trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Background: The clinical characteristics and treatment of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 after recovery remained elusive. Effective antiviral therapy is important for tackling these patients. We assessed the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for treating these patients. Methods: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial in SARS-CoV-2 RNA re-positive patients. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either favipiravir, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary outcome was time to achieve a consecutive twice (at intervals of more than 24 h) negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab and sputum sample. Results: Between March 27 and May 9, 2020, 55 patients underwent randomization; 36 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 19 were assigned to the control group. Favipiravir group had a significantly shorter time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab and sputum than control group (median 17 vs. 26 days); hazard ratio 2.1 (95% CI [1.1-4.0], p = 0.038). The proportion of virus shedding in favipiravir group was higher than control group (80.6% [29/36] vs. 52.6% [10/19], p = 0.030, respectively). C-reactive protein decreased significantly after treatment in the favipiravir group (p = 0.016). The adverse events were generally mild and self-limiting. Conclusion: Favipiravir was safe and superior to control in shortening the duration of viral shedding in SARS-CoV2 RNA recurrent positive after discharge. However, a larger scale and randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial is required to confirm our conclusion.

TI  - Investigation of the Frequency of Adverse Effects in Patients Treated with Favipiravir as SARS-CoV-2 Treatment
T2  - KLIMIK JOURNAL
AB  - Objective: For 2019 and 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has been a sensational virus. Unfortunately, a treatment agent specific for SARS-CoV-2 has not been developed yet. Favipiravir is one of the antiviral agents used experimentally in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to determine the frequency of side effects seen in patients hospitalized in our hospital and received favipiravir at any stage of their treatment.
   Methods: Our study is a retrospective observational study. Definite and probable COVID-19 cases hospitalized in our hospital between March 23, 2020, May 31, 2020 were determined, and those receiving favipiravir as initial or secondary therapy were included in the study. The demographic data, laboratory tests, observed side effects of the patients were recorded and analyzed statistically.
   Results: A total of 134 patients, 37.3% using favipiravir at the beginning and 62.7% as secondary, were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 66.8 +/- 15.7 years. 38.1% (n=51) of the group were female. Side effects were detected in 17 (13%) patients in the whole group. Hepatotoxicity (4.5%), increased serum uric acid (4.5%), nephrotoxicity (1.5%), gastrointestinal side effects (1.5%), cardiac side effects (0.7%) were detected. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of adverse events between the patients who received favipiravir initially or later on disease course.
   Conclusions: Although some results support the short-term safety of favipiravir, more studies are needed for its long-term effects. Studies on hyperuricemia, QTc prolongation, use in pregnancy, use during lactation and use in children are insufficient. Therefore, although Favipiravir appears to be a good alternative in the treatment of COVID-19, it should be used carefully because the data on its safety is still insufficient.

TI  - A contemporary look at COVID-19 medications: available an potentially effective drugs
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There have been significant changes to the management of COVID-19 in recent months, including protocols and guidelines designed to prevent, diagnose, and treat the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Several management options have been suggested and have since gained popularity, though we expect additional modifications to be made, as well as more new cases in the coming months, given a lack of definitive treatment and well-controlled experiments. This review highlights the available and potential treatments, along with the challenges associated with each.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive overview of all peer-reviewed studies, editorial comments, and letters to the editor based on a search in PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. The following terms were used: "COVID-19," "SARS-CoV-2," "drug," "treatment," "medication," and "management." All searches were done between March and May 20, 2020.
   RESULTS: There are several potential medications available for COVID-19, such as Interferon a (IFN-alpha), Teicoplanin, Ribavirin, Galidesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Chloroquine phosphate, Arbidol, Velpatasvir, Favipiravir, Ledipasvir, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Darunavir, Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QPD), and lmatinib. However, we do not have a definitive and specific treatment yet.
   CONCLUSIONS: We are expecting to have more cases in the coming weeks/months. Therefore, further research is needed to characterize the disease behavior, to find the absolute drug, and to refine the treatment.

TI  - A Narrative Review of Antiviral Drugs Used for COVID-19 Pharmacotherapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND BIOALLIED SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose: A number of research articles has been published evaluating safety and efficacy of drugs against COVID-19. This study was undertaken to collate and review the information regarding common proposed anti- viral drugs for easy reference. Methods: The literature was search was done using terms like severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV or COVID-19 in combination with drugs or treatment or pharmaco-therapy using PubMed and google scholar to identify relevant articles. Results: Despite showing good early results, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir has not shown clinical benefit in randomized controlled trials. However lopinavir in combination with other drugs specially interferon is being investigated. Remdesivir has shown positive effect in terms of clinical improvement and continued to being investigated alone or in combination with other drugs. Favipiravir has shown mixed results and more data from adequately powered study is needed to prove its efficacy. Conclusions: Many drugs which showed positive effect in initial studies could not replicate the same benefit in large randomized controlled trials. There is need to evaluate efficacy and safety of drugs based on high quality evidence before allowing it to be used in general population.

TI  - Can the Antivirals Remdesivir and Favipiravir Work Better Jointly? In Silico Insights
T2  - DRUG RESEARCH
AB  - The proverb "Old is gold" is applicable in drug discovery and the proverb "All that Glitters is not Gold" is also appropriate. In the COVID-19 era, there has been a race for drugs to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. There are reports about the uses of Remdesivir and Favipiravir as existing antivirals against virus but none have been conclusive so far. In the attempts for innovations, the combination of drugs is also undertrials. Therefore, we used the densityfunctional theory method and quantum theory of atoms in moleculesto investigate drug-drug interactions involving Remdesivir and Favipiravir. The computed parameters were related to the antiviral actions of both drugs together. The results indicate enhanced antiviral activity and it will be worthy to consider additional investigations with the combination of these two drugs.

TI  - Therapeutic Interventions Implemented During the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review of Evidence
T2  - CYPRUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - The aim of this study was to review the knowledge and evidence on the therapeutic effectiveness of some agents currently utilized for treating coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
   The literature search was performed using the databases PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library. The publications identified were screened to select cohort studies, randomised controlled trials, meta-analyses, narrative and systematic reviews. End points displaying the results of epidemiological and statistical methods were evaluated to specify the strength of evidence.
   Eleven randomised controlled trials, a controlled trial, five cohort studies, four reviews, two systematic reviews, a systematic review-meta-analysis, and a meta-analysis were included. These 25 studies covered treatments with antimalarials, anticoagulation, antivirals, corticosteroids, interferons, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma. The outcomes assessed included all-cause and in-hospital mortality, death or mechanical ventilation within 28 days, mean or median day to viral clearance, median and day-28 recovery time, and improvement in oxygen support class.
   The results showed evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir and corticosteroids in critically ill patients. Only corticosteroids showed efficacy regarding reduced mortality. Favipiravir, anticoagulation, interferons and monoclonal antibodies were agents with weaker evidence of therapeutic efficacy.
   The key findings of this review highlight evidence regarding the efficacy of remdesivir and corticosteroids for hospitalised patients.

TI  - STUDY OF AVAILABLE ANTIVIRAL TREATMENTS FOR COVID-19 DURING PREGNANCY
T2  - FARMACIA
AB  - Since the end of the year 2019, mankind has been confronting with the COVID-19 pandemic. Complex measures have been taken to solve this problem and the aim of this study is to summarise the results of research on the most used antiviral treatments for COVID-19 diagnosed in pregnant women. The specialty literature review was conducted by searching the PubMed (National Library of Medicine, Washington, DC) and Embase (Elsevier) databases. In the initial search in databases we used a combination of the following keywords: "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "pregnancy" and "therapy". Clinical trials were identified using the search term "COVID-19" and the generic names of the drugs on ClinicalTrials.gov and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) of WHO. Corresponding to the objectives of our research, we found articles and studies about antiviral drugs which act as: protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat), RNA polymerase inhibitors (remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin), umifenovir, antimalarial drugs (chloroquine, hydroxyclhoroquine) and others. Summarising what is currently known about the antiviral treatment of COVID-19 during pregnancy, we can conclude that, at this time, no antiviral drug is undoubtedly effective in the fight against SARS-CoV-2; the experience gained so far, leads to the idea that treatment schemes must combine several methods and drugs to be successful; a national or even international register should be set up to report situations where a medicine has been administered to a pregnant woman to monitor for side effects; pregnant women should also be included in studies, under rigorous conditions and after a clear demonstration of the effectiveness of medicines.

TI  - Outcome of early-stage combination treatment with favipiravir and methylprednisolone for severe COVID-19 pneumonia: A report of 11 cases
T2  - RESPIRATORY INVESTIGATION
AB  - Although the use of corticosteroids is not recommended in the World Health Organization statement for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), steroid therapy may be indicated for critical cases in specific situations. Here, we report the successful treatment of 11 cases of severe COVID-19 pneumonia with favipiravir and methylprednisolone. All cases were severe and patients required oxygen administration or had a blood oxygen saturation similar to 93% on room air. All were treated with favipiravir and methylprednisolone, and 10 of 11 patients responded well and required no further oxygen supplementation or ventilator management. This study shows the importance of the early-stage use of a combination of favipiravir and methylprednisolone in severe cases to achieve a favorable clinical outcome.

TI  - COVID-19 Infection in a Patient with Common Variable Immunodeficiency: Experience with Favipiravir and Intravenous Immunoglobulin
T2  - ASTIM ALLERJI IMMUNOLOJI
AB  - Data regarding COVID-19 infection in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) are limited. Herein, we present a 28-year-old male patient with CVID admitted for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement with myalgia and a productive cough. A nasopharyngeal swab for the SARS CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction assay was positive. Chest computed tomography was consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient refused hospitalization and the applicable treatment for COVID-19. Although he was prescribed IVIG, he had a lapse in IVIG replacement due to supply problems. The patient was later brought to the emergency room due to the deterioration of his general condition with dyspnea, tachypnea, shortness of breath, cough, and fever five days after the initial presentation. He was treated with favipiravir and IVIG and had a positive outcome. Results of COVID-19 infection in CVID patients are diverse, possibly due to underlying genetic defects. Although our patient had an increased risk for severe disease due to CVID, a lapse in IVIG replacement, and obesity, he did not require intensive care or intubation. Further studies are needed to determine and develop treatment strategies for COVID-19 infection in patients diagnosed with CVID.

TI  - Favipiravir in the Battle with Respiratory Viruses
T2  - MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Among antiviral drugs, the vast majority targets only one or two related viruses. The conventional model, one virus - one drug, significantly limits therapeutic options. Therefore, in the strategy of controlling viral infections, there is a necessity to develop compounds with pleiotropic effects. Favipiravir (FPV) emerged as a strong candidate to become such a drug. The aim of the study is to present up-to-date information on the role of favipiravir in the treatment of viral respiratory infections. The anti-influenza activity of favipiravir has been confirmed in cell culture experiments, animal models, and clinical trials. Thoroughly different - from the previously registered drugs - mechanism of action suggests that FVP can be used as a countermeasure for the novel or re-emerging influenza virus infections. In recent months, favipiravir has been broadly investigated due to its potential efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. Based on preclinical and clinical studies and a recently published meta-analysis it seems that favipiravir may be a promising antiviral drug in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. FPV is also effective against other RNA respiratory viruses and may be a candidate for the treatment of serious infections caused by human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

TI  - Favipiravir Versus Arbidol for Clinical Recovery Rate in Moderate and Severe Adult COVID-19 Patients: A Prospective, Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Background: In addition to supportive therapy, antiviral therapy is an effective treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
   Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of favipiravir and umifenovir (Arbidol) to treat COVID-19 patients.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Enrolled patients with initial symptoms within 12 days were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Arbidol (200 mg*3/day) or favipiravir (1600 mg*2/first day followed by 600 mg*2/day) for 7 days. The primary outcome was the clinical recovery rate at day 7 of drug administration (relief for pyrexia and cough, respiratory frequency <= 24 times/min; oxygen saturation >= 98%). Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough and the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV)/mechanical ventilation (MV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days.
   Results: A total of 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 patients were assigned to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). The clinical recovery rate at day 7 of drug administration did not significantly differ between the favipiravir group (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (p = 0.1396, difference in recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: -0.0305 similar to 0.2213). Favipiravir contributed to relief for both pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, p < 0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75 days, p < 0.0001). No difference was observed in the AOT or NMV/MV rate (both p > 0.05). The most frequently observed favipiravir-associated adverse event was increased serum uric acid (16/116, OR: 5.52, p = 0.0014).
   Conclusion: Among patients with COVID-19, favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly improve the clinical recovery rate at day 7. Favipiravir significantly improved the latency to relieve pyrexia and cough. Adverse effects caused by favipiravir are mild and manageable.

TI  - Repurposing Therapeutics for Potential Treatment of SARS-CoV-2: A Review
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - The need for proven disease-specific treatments for the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 necessitates a worldwide search for therapeutic options. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus shares extensive homology with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, effective therapies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may also have therapeutic potential for the current COVID-19 outbreak. To identify therapeutics that might be repositioned for treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19, we strategically reviewed the literature to identify existing therapeutics with evidence of efficacy for the treatment of the three coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Mechanistic and in vitro analyses suggest multiple promising therapeutic options with potential for repurposing to treat patients with COVID-19. Therapeutics with particularly high potential efficacy for repurposing include camostat mesylate, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, convalescent plasma, and humanized monoclonal antibodies. Camostat mesylate has shown therapeutic potential, likely by preventing viral entry into epithelial cells. In early research, the targeted antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir appear to benefit patients by decreasing viral replication; clinical trials suggest that remdesivir speeds recovery from COVID-19. Tocilizumab and baricitinib appear to improve mortality by preventing a severe cytokine storm. Convalescent plasma and humanized monoclonal antibodies offer passive immunity and decreased recovery time. This review highlights potential therapeutic options that may be repurposed to treat COVID-19 and suggests opportunities for further research.

TI  - Favipiravir-based treatment for outcomes of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Background This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of favipiravir for patients with mild-to-critical COVID-19. Methods PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for RCTs published before 30 October 2021. Only RCTs that compared the clinical efficacy and safety of favipiravir -based antiviral regimens (study group) with other alternative treatments or placebos (control group) in patients with COVID-19 were included. Results Overall, the clinical improvement rate was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group at the assessment conducted after 14 days (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.12-2.98). The rate of virological eradication was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group at the assessment conducted after 28 days (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.15-3.78). No significant difference was observed in the rates of invasive mechanical ventilation requirement or ICU admission, mortality, or risk of an adverse event between the study and control groups. Conclusions Except the clinical improvement rate within 14 days and the virological eradication rate within 28 days, favipiravir-based treatment did not provide significantly additional benefit for patients with COVID-19. Therefore, more evidence is necessary.

TI  - A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis for comparative safety assessment of favipiravir interventions in hospitalized COVID-19 patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 is a coronavirus-based infectious illness that was first detected at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China. The novel virus induces severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and has spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. There is still a lack of evidence for direct comparison of favipiravir therapy. Network meta-analysis (NMA), may incorporate direct and indirect comparisons in a pooled computation while depending on strong assumptions and premises. This study provides evidence-based recommendations on the safety of currently used clinical pharmacological treatments compared to favipiravir for COVID-19 patients. Methodology: We conducted a systematic review and Bayesian NMA. We searched the primary databases and clinical trials center for reports of short-term, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of favipiravir for COVID-19 treatment. The primary endpoints here considered were any adverse events observed or reported during the treatment cycle with estimates of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), until Results: Between January 2020 and July 2021, 908 individuals were randomly assigned to one of the seven active prescription medication regimens or placebo in this study, generating seven direct comparisons on 12 data points. The safety of favipiravir over the four clinically efficacious monotherapies or combinations including tocilizumab, arbidol, lopinavir + ritonavir, and chloroquine remained unknown due to the lack of a significant difference and the limited sample size. Conclusions: Overall, comparative rankings could assist doctors and guideline developers in decision-making. We have also concluded that the safety of favipiravir requires further attention.

TI  - In silico Evaluation on the Inhibition Efficacy of Five Antivirals on SARS-CoV-2 Protease (COVID-19)
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
AB  - Background: All over the world rigorous research attempts are going on to find a remedy for the spreading and prevention of the dreadful pandemic of 21"t century, the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). To discover an effective drug for curing and a preventive vaccine against this disease it will take more than one year. According to some medical practitioners certain antivirals which are used for other diseases can cure COVID-19. Aim: In the present investigation, five antivirals claiming to be effective therapeutic agents to mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19 were screened using computational docking studies on the main protease of coronavirus. Materials and Methods: Five antivirals considered are Favipiravir (FVR), Remdesivir (RMR), Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), Lopinavir (LVR) and Ritonavir (RVR). The first three agents FVR, RMR and HCQ are used for the treatment of influenza, ebola and malaria respectively. Lopinavir and Ritonavir are the anti-HIV drugs. Favipiravir and Remdesivir are prod rugs and the active nucleotide metabolites (FVR-RTP and RMR-NTP) were taken for in silico docking investigations. AutoDockvina, EduPyMoL and Discovery Studio software's were used for the computational evaluation. Results: Among the studied molecules HCQ displayed lowest score for the binding energy (-6.1 kcal/mop and LPR showed the highest value (-8.1 kcal/mol) on SARS-CoV-2 protease. The binding energy of the antivirals on the protease follows the order HCQ < RVR < RMR-NTP < FPR-RTP < LPR. Various interactions of the antivirals with the binding pocket of the protease are well explained using 2D and 3D plots. Conclusion: Poor inhibition was noted for HCQ in the protease binding pocket and hence the therapy using this drug for COVID-19 may not be effective. LPR displayed maximum value of binding capacity on the receptor. FPR-RTP interacted well on the protease with seven H-bonds. RVR and RMR molecules also bound the receptor using strong favourable binding forces.

TI  - Can mesenchymal stem cell therapy be the interim management of COVID-19?
T2  - DRUG DISCOVERIES AND THERAPEUTICS
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has accounted for similar to 4.3 million confirmed cases and similar to 292,000 deaths (till 12th May, 2020) across the globe since its outbreak. Several anti-viral drugs such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors (remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin), protease inhibitors (lopinavir, ritonavir) and drugs targeting endocytic pathway (hydroxychloroquine) are being evaluated for COVID-19 but standard therapeutics yet not available. Severe health deterioration in critically ill patients is characterized by pulmonary edema, severe respiratory distress, cytokine storm and septic shock. To combat cytokine storm, immune-therapy targeting IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and TNF alpha are being evaluated and one of the promising immune-modulator is the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that can surmount the severity of COVID-19 infections. Recent studies have shown that MSC-therapy significantly dampens the cytokine storm in critically ill COVID-19 patients. This communication endows with the insight of stem cell therapy and summarizes the recent studies on COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Candidate antiviral drugs for COVID-19 and their environmental implications: a comprehensive analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Emerging from Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 is the new global threat that killed millions of people, and many are still suffering. This pandemic has not only affected people but also caused economic crisis throughout the world. Researchers have shown good progress in revealing the molecular insights of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and developing vaccines, but effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2-infected patients are yet to be found. Several vaccines are available and used in many countries, while many others are still in clinical or preclinical studies. However, this involves a long-term process, considering the safety procedures and requirements and their long-term protection capacity and in different age groups are still questionable. Therefore, at present, the drug repurposing of the existing therapeutics previously designed against other viral diseases seems to be the only practical approach to mitigate the current situation. The safety of most of these therapeutic agents has already been tested. Recent clinical reports revealed promising therapeutic efficiency of several drugs such as remdesivir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, baricitinib, and cepharanthine. Besides, plasma therapies were used to treat patients and prevent fatal outcomes. Thus, in this article, we have summarized the epidemiological and clinical data from several clinical trials conducted since the beginning of the pandemic, emphasizing the efficiency of the known agents against SARS-CoV-2 and their harmful side effects on the human body as well as their environmental implications. This review shows a clear overview of the current pharmaceutical perspective on COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - A Mini Review on Emerging Targets and Approaches for the Synthesis of Anti-viral Compounds: In Perspective to COVID-19
T2  - MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an epidemic disease that appeared at the end of the year 2019 with a sudden increase in number and came to be considered as a pandemic disease caused by a viral infection which has threatened most countries for an emergency search for new anti-SARS-COV drugs /vaccines. At present, the number of clinical trials is ongoing worldwide on different drugs i.e. Hydroxychloroquine, Remedisvir, Favipiravir that utilize various mechanisms of action. A few countries are currently processing clinical trials, which may result in a positive outcome. Favipiravir (FPV) represents one of the feasible treatment options for COVID-19, if the result of the trials turns out positive. Favipiravir will be one of the developed possibly authoritative drugs to warrant benefits to mankind with large-scale production to meet the demands of the current pandemic Covid-19 outbreak and future epidemic outbreaks. In this review, the authors tried to explore key molecules, which will be supportive for devising COVID-19 research.

TI  - An Experience of Multiple Hematomas in a Coronavirus Disease-19 Patient Administered with ART-123 and Heparin
T2  - OPEN ACCESS EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Anticoagulant therapy for patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia is considered to improve the hypercoagulable and inflammatory state. However, bleeding complications should also be considered.
   Case Presentation: A 77-year-old man with a history of falls was diagnosed with COVID-19. Owing to his severe condition, he was intubated and transferred to our hospital for intensive care. Favipiravir, tocilizumab, unfractionated heparin, and ART-123 were administered to treat COVID-19 and manage the antithrombotic prophylaxis for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (Af). On the 6th day after admission, a hematoma was noted on the left chest wall. Computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple hematomas, including hematomas on his chest wall and obturatorius internus muscle. Emergency angiography transcatheter embolization (TAE) was performed. The patient was transferred to another hospital 23 days after TAE, without complications.
   Conclusion: Our findings show that anticoagulation therapy and a history of falls induced multiple hematomas in a COVID-19 patient and that the condition was managed with TAE. When anticoagulants are considered in the management of Af and COVID-19 associated coagulopathy, it is necessary to closely monitor potential bleeding complications.

TI  - Adjunctive favipiravir for severe COVID-19: a retrospective observational study of the first 41 patients in Thailand
T2  - ASIAN BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Favipiravir is a promising drug for COVID-19, but evidence from a robust clinical trial is limited.
   Objective: To describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, and various antiviral treatment regimens (with and without favipiravir) of patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19.
   Method: We conducted a retrospective observational study in all COVID-19 patients admitted at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute (BIDI) from January 8 to March 30, 2020. We compared the demographics, clinical characteristics, and various antiviral treatment regimens of 12 severe and 29 nonsevere COVID-19 patients in Thailand.
   Results: Adjunctive favipiravir was given to only severe cases. The median length of hospitalization of patients either receiving favipiravir or not receiving favipiravir was not significantly different (P = 0.8549), but those who received adjunctive favipiravir became reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction negative 2 days sooner than the other group (median: 6 days vs. 8 days; P = 0.1125).
   Conclusion: The findings suggested that adjunctive favipiravir might not be effective for patients with severe COVID-19, but further studies with larger sample sizes are needed.

TI  - Favipiravir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundFavipiravir possesses high utility for treating patients with COVID-19. However, research examining the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for patients with COVID-19 is limited.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of published studies reporting the efficacy of favipiravir against COVID-19. Two investigators independently searched PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MedRxiv, and ClinicalTrials.gov (inception to September 2020) to identify eligible studies. A meta-analysis was performed to measure viral clearance and clinical improvement as the primary outcomes.ResultsAmong 11 eligible studies, 5 included a comparator group. Comparing to the comparator group, the favipiravir group exhibited significantly better viral clearance on day 7 after the initiation of treatment (odds ratio [OR]=2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.19-5.22), whereas no difference was noted on day 14 (OR=2.19, 95% CI=0.69-6.95). Although clinical improvement was significantly better in the favipiravir group on both days 7 and 14, the improvement was better on day 14 (OR=3.03, 95% CI=1.17-7.80) than on day 7 (OR=1.60, 95% CI=1.03-2.49). The estimated proportions of patients with viral clearance in the favipiravir arm on days 7 and 14 were 65.42 and 88.9%, respectively, versus 43.42 and 78.79%, respectively, in the comparator group. The estimated proportions of patients with clinical improvement on days 7 and 14 in the favipiravir group were 54.33 and 84.63%, respectively, compared with 34.40 and 65.77%, respectively, in the comparator group.ConclusionsFavipiravir induces viral clearance by 7days and contributes to clinical improvement within 14days. The results indicated that favipiravir has strong possibility for treating COVID-19, especially in patients with mild-to-moderate illness. Additional well-designed studies, including examinations of the dose and duration of treatment, are crucial for reaching definitive conclusions.

TI  - COVID-19 pneumonia in a patient with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HEMATOPATHOLOGY
AB  - Although some patients with COVID-19 develop only mild symptoms, fatal complications have been observed among those with comorbidities. As patients with cancer are immunocompromised, they are thought to have a high risk of severe illness associated with COVID-19. We report a COVID-19 patient with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (An) who was treated using favipiravir. A 69-year-old woman with lymphoma-type An was treated using cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone and mogamulizumab (M-CHOP) with substantial efficacy. However, in cycle 4 of M-CHOP therapy, she developed fever with mild cough. The patient was admitted to the hospital and CT revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Considering severe immunosuppression caused by An, we initiated favipiravir therapy. Subsequently, the fever improved without antipyretics and her C-reactive protein level decreased rapidly. SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were negative on days 17 and 18 of favipiravir therapy, and the patient was discharged without residual disease on the final CT. This is the first documented case of COVID-19 in a patient with An. Although severe immunosuppression caused by An was present, severe COVID-19 pneumonia did not develop. The immunosuppressed condition caused by hematological malignancy may not always be a risk factor for severe illness associated with COVID-19. Further accumulation of data regarding COVID-19 in patients with hematological malignancies is warranted to clarify the risk factors for severe illness, the best-in-class antiviral agent, and the optimal treatment strategy in this population.

TI  - Favipiravir for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia; a propensity score-matched cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - We retrospectively investigated the clinical outcomes of favipiravir in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients who between 23 May 2020 and 18 July 2020 received >= 24 h of favipiravir were assigned to the favipiravir group, while those who did not formed the non-favipiravir group. The primary outcome was 28 -day clinical improvement, defined as two-category improvement from baseline on an 8-point ordinal scale. Propensity scores (PS) for favipiravir therapy were used for 1:1 matching. The unmatched cohort included 1493 patients, of which 51.7% were in the favipiravir group, and 48.3% were not receiving supplemental oxygen at baseline. Significant baseline differences between the two unmatched groups existed, but not between the PS-matched groups (N = 774). After PS-matching, there were no significant differences be-tween the two groups in the proportion with 28-day clinical improvement (93.3% versus 92.8%, P 0.780), or 28-day all-cause mortality (2.1% versus 3.1%, P 0.360). Favipiravir was associated with more viral clearance by day 28 (79.8% versus 64.1%, P < 0.001). Adverse events were common in both groups, but the 93.9% were Grades 1-3. Favipiravir therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia is well tolerated but is not associated with an increased likelihood of clinical improvement or reduced all-cause mortality by 28 days.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - COVID-19-associated liver enzyme elevation is probably multifactorial
T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
AB  - Elevation of serum hepatic enzymes are common during the course of COVID-19. There are three possible mechanisms behind this phenomenon: 1) direct and indirect cytotoxic effects of SARS-CoV-2, 2) pharmacological side effects of COVID-19 drugs (eg., remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, systemic corticosteroids, etc.) and 3) the progression of chronic hepatic diseases. Both the differential diagnosis and the clinical decision-making may pose difficulty for the the astute clinician, as an inappropriate treatment may result in COVID-19 progression or liver function deterioration. This review aims to provide basic guidance on the clinical decision-making for physicians managing patients with COVID-19.

TI  - The Impact of the COVID-19 "Infodemic" on Drug-Utilization Behaviors: Implications for Pharmacovigilance
T2  - DRUG SAFETY
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that hit the world in 2020 triggered a massive dissemination of information (an "infodemic") about the disease that was channeled through the print, broadcast, web, and social media. This infodemic also included sensational and distorted information about drugs that likely first influenced opinion leaders and people particularly active on social media and then other people, thus affecting choices by individual patients everywhere. In particular, information has spread about some drugs approved for other indications (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, favipiravir, and umifenovir) that could have led to inappropriate and therefore hazardous use. In this article, we analyze the rationale behind the claims for use of these drugs in COVID-19, the communication about their effects on the disease, the consequences of this communication on people's behavior, and the responses of some influential regulatory authorities in an attempt to minimize the actual or potential risks arising from this behavior. Finally, we discuss the role of pharmacovigilance stakeholders in emergency management and possible strategies to deal with other similar crises in the future.

TI  - Effectiveness of Favipiravir on Nonsevere, Early-Stage COVID-19 in Japan: A Large Observational Study Using the COVID-19 Registry Japan
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THERAPY
AB  - Introduction Several randomized controlled trials have compared the effectiveness of favipiravir with that of placebo. However, evidence regarding its effect on nonsevere, early-stage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains insufficient. Methods We used the COVID-19 Registry Japan, a nationwide registry of inpatients with COVID-19, for evaluating the effectiveness of favipiravir on patients with nonsevere, early-stage COVID-19. Eligible patients, who did not need supplementary oxygen therapy at admission, were classified according to two regimens (starting favipiravir therapy within 4 days from admission vs. no favipiravir during hospitalization) and were then compared using a three-step method (cloning, censoring, and weighting). The primary outcome was supplementary oxygen requirement during hospitalization, and the secondary outcomes were the need for invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (IMV/ECMO) and overall mortality at 30 days. Results A total of 7654 cases were analyzed. The "start favipiravir" regimen did not show substantial differences in the primary outcome [hazard ratio 0.825, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.657-1.04, p = 0.098] and both of the secondary outcomes [need for IMV/ECMO and overall 30-day mortality, hazard ratio 1.02 (95% CI 0.649-1.60) and 0.869 (95% CI 0.519-1.46), p = 0.929 and 0.594, respectively]. Conclusions In this large cohort from a COVID-19 registry, favipiravir was not associated with a positive effect on the clinical outcome on patients with nonsevere, early-stage COVID-19, suggesting that it is not an essential drug for COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Screening Potential Drugs for COVID-19 Based on Bound Nuclear Norm Regularization
T2  - FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB  - The novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 infected by SARS-CoV-2 has attracted worldwide attention. It is urgent to find effective therapeutic strategies for stopping COVID-19. In this study, a Bounded Nuclear Norm Regularization (BNNR) method is developed to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates. First, three virus-drug association datasets are compiled. Second, a heterogeneous virus-drug network is constructed. Third, complete genomic sequences and Gaussian association profiles are integrated to compute virus similarities; chemical structures and Gaussian association profiles are integrated to calculate drug similarities. Fourth, a BNNR model based on kernel similarity (VDA-GBNNR) is proposed to predict possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. VDA-GBNNR is compared with four existing advanced methods under fivefold cross-validation. The results show that VDA-GBNNR computes better AUCs of 0.8965, 0.8562, and 0.8803 on the three datasets, respectively. There are 6 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs overlapping in any two datasets, that is, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, mycophenolic acid, niclosamide, and mizoribine. Molecular dockings are conducted for the 6 small molecules and the junction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. In particular, niclosamide and mizoribine show higher binding energy of -8.06 and -7.06 kcal/mol with the junction, respectively. G496 and K353 may be potential key residues between anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and the interface junction. We hope that the predicted results can contribute to the treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - In silico evaluation of potential inhibitory activity of remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin and galidesivir active forms on SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase
T2  - MOLECULAR DIVERSITY
AB  - Since the outbreak emerged in November 2019, no effective drug has yet been found against SARS-CoV-2. Repositioning studies of existing drug molecules or candidates are gaining in overcoming COVID-19. Antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, and galidesivir act by inhibiting the vital RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. The importance of in silico studies in repurposing drug research is gradually increasing during the COVID-19 process. The present study found that especially ribavirin triphosphate and galidesivir triphosphate active metabolites had a higher affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase than ATP by molecular docking. With the Molecular Dynamics simulation, we have observed that these compounds increase the complex's stability and validate the molecular docking results. We also explained that the interaction of RNA polymerase inhibitors with Mg++,( )which is in the structure of NSP12, is essential and necessary to interact with the RNA strand. In vitro and clinical studies on these two molecules need to be increased.

TI  - Current pharmacological treatments for SARS-COV-2: A narrative review
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The novel coronavirus, later identified as SARS-CoV-2, originating from Wuhan in China in November 2019, quickly spread around the world becoming a pandemic. Despite the knowledge of previous coronaviruses, such as those responsible for the SARS and MERS-CoV epidemic, there is no drug or prophylaxis treatment to this day. The rapid succession of scientific findings on SARS-CoV-2 provides a significant number of potential drug targets. Nevertheless, at the same time, the high quantity of clinical data, generated by a large number of rapidly infected people, require accurate tests regarding effective medical treatments. Several in vitro and in vivo studies were rapidly initiated after the outbreak of the pandemic COVID-19. Initial clinical studies revealed the promising potential of remdesivir that demonstrated a powerful and specific in vitro antiviral activity for COVID-19. Promising effects appear to be attributable to hydroxychloroquine. Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine are being tested in ongoing randomized trials. In contrast, oseltamivir was not effective and corticosteroids are not currently recommended. However, few data from ongoing clinical trials are identifying low molecular weight heparins, innate immune system stimulating agents, and inflammatory modulating agents as potential effective agents.
   The authors assume that the current pandemic will determine the need for a systematic approach based on big data analysis for identifying effective drugs to defeat SARS-Cov-2. This work is aimed to be a general reference point and to provide an overview as comprehensive as possible regarding the main clinical trials in progress at the moment.

TI  - Synthesis and investigation of anti-COVID19 ability of ferrocene Schiff-base derivatives by quantum chemical and molecular docking
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB  - The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rampaged the world with more than 236 million confirmed cases and over 4.8 million deaths across the world reported by the world health organization (WHO) till Oct 5, 2021. Due to the advent of different variants of coronavirus, there is an urgent need to identify effective drugs and vaccines to combat rapidly spreading virus varieties across the globe. Ferrocene derivatives have attained immense interest as anticancer, antifungal, antibacterial, and antiparasitic drug candidates. However, the ability of ferrocene as anti-COVID-19 is not yet explored. Therefore, in the present work, we have synthesized four new ferrocene Schiffbases (L1-L4) to understand the active sites and biological activity of ferrocene derivatives by employing various molecular descriptors, frontier molecular orbitals (FMO), electron affinity, ionization potential, and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP). A theoretical insight on synthesized ferrocene Schiffbases was accomplished by molecular docking, frontier molecular orbitals energies, active sites, and molecular descriptors which were further compared with drugs being currently used against COVID-19, i.e., dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir (FPV), and remdesivir (RDV). Moreover, through the molecular docking approach, we recorded the inhibitions of ferrocene derivatives on core protease (6LU7) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of substituents on the anti-COVID activity of these synthesized compounds. The computational outcome indicated that L1 has a powerful 6LU7 inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the currently used drugs. These results could be helpful to design new ferrocene compounds and explore their potential application in the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Current Findings Regarding Natural Components With Potential Anti-2019-nCoV Activity
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB  - COVID-19, a novel coronavirus pneumonia (named by the World Health Organization, WHO), has spread widely since the end of 2019. Research on synthetic drugs and vaccines has become a focus of attention in China and other countries, as such approaches are regarded as key tools for disease prevention and control; however, the development of these therapeutics will take months, or even years. Under such circumstances, development of coronavirus specific therapeutics is urgent. For this specific indication, the rapid performance of natural products, such as plant compounds, herbal extracts, and traditional Chinese medicine, could contribute as alternative measures. Recent investigations have provided evidence that these natural products are potential candidates for development as therapeutic agents against the virus that causes COVID-19, 2019-nCoV. Targeting the structural proteins or cellular receptors of 2019-nCoV, including coronavirus chymotrypsin-like (3CL(pro)or M-pro), helicase (nsP13), S protein, and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), holds promise for preventing infection. In this review, we summarize some representative natural products and their active components that have potential anti-2019-nCoV effects. We focus on the basic structural elements of 2019-nCoV, its main mechanisms of action, and the feasibility and potential of products to inhibit the novel coronavirus. In addition, the relative advantages, additional functions, and precautions that should be used with typical natural products are also discussed. The aim is to make the case that natural products could be a valuable pool for the development of active compounds for treating 2019-nCoV infection, which may contribute to mitigation of the spread of the pandemic.

TI  - Directly Acting Antivirals for COVID-19: Where Do We Stand?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has now become a pandemic with no approved therapeutic agent. At the moment, the genomic structure, characteristics, and pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported. Based upon this information, several drugs including the directly acting antivirals have been proposed to treat people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This rapid review aims to describe the directly acting antivirals that have been examined for use in the management of COVID-19. Searches were conducted in three electronic databases, supplemented with a search on arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChinaXiv,, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry for studies examining the use of antivirals in COVID-19 to identify for case reports, case series, observational studies, and randomized controlled studies describing the use of antivirals in COVID-19. Data were extracted independently and presented narratively. A total of 98 studies were included, comprising of 38 published studies and 60 registered clinical trials. These drugs include the broad spectrum antivirals such as umifenovir, protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir as well as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, remdesivir, and favipiravir. Other drugs that have been used include the nucleosidase inhibitors and polymerase acidic endonuclease inhibitors which are currently approved for prevention of influenza infections. While some of the drugs appear promising in small case series and reports, more clinical trials currently in progress are required to provide higher quality evidence.

TI  - Retrospective evaluation of seven different treatment protocols in hospitalized COVID-19 patients
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background/aim: As the experience has increased regarding SARS-CoV-2 in time, treatment trends have changed since the beginning of the pandemic. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of different treatment modalities for inpatients in a tertiary pandemic Materials and methods: Individuals aged 18 years and above who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in PCR with presenting COVIDrelated radiological findings, hospitalized for at least 3 days, and completed follow-up between March 15, 2020 and November 30, 2020 were included in the study. Patients' data were reviewed retrospectively. Seven treatment groups based on the single or combined use of hydroxychloroquine, oseltamivir, favipiravir, and remdesivir were formed and compared in terms of mortality, survival, length of hospital stay, need for intensive care, and mechanical ventilation. Results: A total of 321 patients were included in the study. The length of hospital stay, the need for intensive care, and mechanical ventilation were lower in Group 1 (hydroxychloroquine) and Group 2 (hydroxychloroquine + oseltamivir) compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). No significant difference was determined in survival between treatment groups. Analysis of prognostic factors affecting overall survival revealed that the need for intensive care and mechanical ventilation increased mortality [11.1 times (p < 0.001) and 6.48 times (p < 0.001), respectively]. Conclusion: No significant difference was determined between different treatment protocols in terms of their impact on survival. To end the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to develop highly efficient, rapid-acting, and orally available antiviral drugs.

TI  - Combined Therapy of Ciclosporin Plus Favipiravir in the Management of Patients with Severe COVID-19, not Responding to Dexamethasone: A non-Controlled Prospective Trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Background: Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, potential therapeutic agents are being evaluated almost every day. Ciclosporin, a calcineurin inhibitor, is characterized by beneficial antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ciclosporin in managing COVID-19. Methods: This study was a prospective non-controlled clinical trial carried out on 20 patients. Confirmed COVID19 patients received two doses of ciclosporin (10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg injections) 24 h apart. Mortality rate and the lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays were assessed for all 20 patients. Results: The mortality rate and the need for mechanical ventilation were calculated as 50%. The percentage of ICU admission was 70%. The lengths of ICU and hospital stays were 8.13 +/- 6.81 and 14.25 +/- 8.55 days, respectively. The levels of ferritin and white blood cells were significantly higher after injecting the second dose of ciclosporin. Seven patients (35%) had radiologically improved lungs after ciclosporin therapy. Conclusion: It seems that the protocol of two doses of ciclosporin in combination with favipiravir does not have favorable effects among COVID-19 patients that do not respond to dexamethasone. Controlled trials are needed to confirm the results.

TI  - Elevated INR in a COVID-19 patient after concomitant administration of favipiravir and warfarin: A case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS
AB  - What is known and objective Favipiravir is a promising treatment candidate for managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Warfarin has many drug interactions, but no interactions with favipiravir have been reported. Case summary Our patient was taking warfarin for deep vein thrombosis. The international normalized ratio (INR) was stable (1.65 to 2.0); however, it increased to 4.63 after administering favipiravir. The patient had no other factors justifying this change. What is new and conclusion Favipiravir and warfarin might have previously unidentified drug interactions that elevated the INR. Therefore, INR must be closely monitored when they are concomitantly administered in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Identification of Drug Combination Therapies for SARS-CoV-2: A Molecular Dynamics Simulations Approach
T2  - DRUG DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND THERAPY
AB  - Purpose: The development of effective treatments for coronavirus infectious disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Coronavirus-2 was hindered by the little data available about this virus at the start of the pandemic. Drug repurposing provides a good strategy to explore approved drugs' possible SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity. Moreover, drug synergism is essential in antiviral treatment due to improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. In this work, we studied the effect of approved and investigational drugs on one of SARS-CoV -2 essential proteins, the main protease (Mpro), in search of antiviral treatments and/or drug combinations. Methods: Different possible druggable sites of Mpro were identified and screened against an in-house library of more than 4000 chemical compounds. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to explore conformational changes induced by different ligands' binding. Subsequently, the inhibitory effect of the identified compounds and the suggested drug combinations on the Mpro were established using a 3CL protease (SARS-CoV-2) assay kit. Results: Three potential inhibitors in three different binding sites were identified; favipiravir, cefixime, and carvedilol. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted the synergistic effect of two drug combinations: favipiravir/cefixime, and favipiravir/carvedilol. The in vitro inhibitory effect of the predicted drug combinations was established on this enzyme. Conclusion: In this work, we could study one of the promising SARS-CoV-2 viral protein targets in searching for treatments for COVID-19. The inhibitory effect of several drugs on Mpro was established in silico and in vitro assays. Molecular dynamics simulations showed promising results in predicting the synergistic effect of drug combinations.

TI  - Theoretical insights into the effect of halogenated substituent on the electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of the favipiravir tautomeric forms and its implications for the treatment of COVID-19
T2  - RSC ADVANCES
AB  - In this study, we systematically investigated the electronic structure, spectroscopic (nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, Raman, electron ionization mass spectrometry, UV-Vis, circular dichroism, and emission) properties, and tautomerism of halogenated favipiravir compounds (fluorine, chlorine, and bromine) from a computational perspective. Additionally, the effects of hydration on the proton transfer mechanism of the tautomeric forms of the halogenated favipiravir compounds are discussed. Our results suggest that spectroscopic properties allow for the elucidation of such tautomeric forms. As is well-known, the favipiravir compound has excellent antiviral properties and hence was recently tested for the treatment of new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Through in silico modeling, in the current study, we evaluate the role of such tautomeric forms in order to consider the effect of drug-metabolism in the inhibition process of the main protease (M-pro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 virus. According to the molecular docking, all halogenated compounds presented a better interaction energy than the co-crystallized active ligand (-3.5 kcal mol(-1)) in the viral RdRp, in both wild-type (-6.3 to -6.5 kcal mol(-1)) and variant (-5.4 to -5.6 kcal mol(-1)) models. The variant analyzed for RdRp (Y176C) decreases the affinity of the keto form of the compounds in the active site, and prevented the ligands from interacting with RNA. These findings clearly indicated that all these compounds are promising as drug candidates for this molecular target.

T2  - DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB  - Smart implementation of novel advanced nanocarriers such as functionalized C24 and B12N12 nanocages is used supplement for antiviral activity 5-Fluoro-2-hydroxypyrazine-3-carboxamide (Favipiravir; Avigan; T-705), as treatment of COVID-19. The interaction energies of Favipiravir with perfect (B12N12 and C24) and doped (BC23 and CB11N12) nanocages were studied at temperatures equal to 310.15 K and 298.15 K using DFT. Our results have shown that the interaction of the Favipiravir (C--O group) with BC23 and CB11N12 is more favorable than with the C24 and B12N12 nanocages in the gas and aqueous environments. Additionally, the natural bond orbital, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), energy gap, chemical reactivity, molecular electrostatic potential, and thermodynamic parameters of the optimized structure have been examined. Furthermore, the UV-Vis and infrared spectroscopy have been evaluated for the investigation of the molecular orbitals Participated in the absorption spectrum of the Favipiravir before and after the interaction with the C24, BC23, B12N12, and CB11N12, sites at maximum wavelength utilizing the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-B3LYP and TD-CAM-B3LYP). The intermolecular interactions have been analyzed by non-covalent interactions (NCI) and also, the electron localization function (ELF) is discussed.

T2  - MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION MICROBES AND ANTIMICROBIALS
AB  - Introduction: In this study, it was aimed to retrospectively evaluate the clinical course, laboratory findings and radiological features of patients with severe Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in a 200-bed secondary state hospital.
   Materials and Methods: Male and non-pregnant female patients older than 18 years who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia between 01.04.2020-01.07.2020 were included in our study. Severe pneumonia was defined as the presence of tachypnea (>30 breaths/ min) and/or hypoxia (SpO2 <90% room air) and/or bilateral diffuse ground-glass infiltrations. Conformity of continuous data to normal distribution was evaluated with Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. In the analysis of the relationship between laboratory parameters and mortality, independent groups t-test was used for parametric data and Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-parametric data.
   Results: Sixty two (60.8%) of the patients were male, with a mean age of 60.2 +/- 16.1 years (n=102). Of the study group 76.5% had at least one or more comorbid diseases. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (60.3%), diabetes mellitus (42.3%) and coronary artery disease (26.9%). The most common symptoms observed in patients at the time of admission were cough (n=63, 61.8%), dyspnea (n=57, 55.9%), fever (n=33, 32.4%) and malaise (n=22, 21.6%). Severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction test was positive in 68% (n=70) of the patients. Blood culture was taken from 42.3% of the patients who were admitted with the complaint of fever and there was no detected culture growth. During the hospitalization period, the rate of patients who received any of the antibiotic treatments including azithromycin, clarithromycin, moxifloxacin was 90.2% and 66.7% (n=68) of them were treated with azithromycin. Of the patients 42.2% (n=43) required treatment in the intensive care unit. A favorable clinical response was observed in 74.5% (n=77) of the patients and nine of these patients were discharged with partial recovery and recommendation for home oxygen support therapy. The mortality rate was 24.5% (n=25). The mean of lactate dehydrogenase level and the mean urea level were higher in the group with mortality (p <= 0.001).
   Conclusion: Despite the low rates of bacterial coinfection and/or secondary bacterial infection in COVID-19, frequently given antibiotic treatments contribute to the problem of antimicrobial resistance, creating a serious public health problem and causing an economic burden. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are required for treatment protocols of which potential benefits have not yet been proven.

TI  - RETRACTED: Efficacy of favipiravir in COVID-19 treatment: a multi-center randomized study (Retracted article. See vol. 167, pg. 277, 2022)
T2  - ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY
AB  - No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19. This was a multicenter randomized controlled study including 96 patients with COVID- 19 who were randomly assigned into a chloroquine (CQ) group and a favipiravir group. None of the patients in the favipiravir group needed mechanical ventilation (p = 0.129). One patient (2.3%) in the favipiravir group and two patients (4.2%) in the CQ group died (p = 1.00). Favipiravir is a promising drug for COVID-19 that decreases the hospital stay and the need for mechanical ventilation. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04351295.

TI  - Enhancing the Antiviral Potency of Nucleobases for Potential Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Therapies
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Broad-spectrum antiviral therapies hold promise as a first-line defense against emerging viruses by blunting illness severity and spread until vaccines and virus-specific antivirals are developed. The nucleobase favipiravir, often discussed as a broad-spectrum inhibitor, was not effective in recent clinical trials involving patients infected with Ebola virus or SARS-CoV-2. A drawback of favipiravir use is its rapid clearance before conversion to its active nucleoside-5 '-triphosphate form. In this work, we report a synergistic reduction of flavivirus (dengue, Zika), orthomyxovirus (influenza A), and coronavirus (HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) replication when the nucleobases favipiravir or T-1105 were combined with the antimetabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside (6MMPr). The 6MMPr/T-1105 combination increased the C-U and G-A mutation frequency compared to treatment with T-1105 or 6MMPr alone. A further analysis revealed that the 6MMPr/T-1105 co-treatment reduced cellular purine nucleotide triphosphate synthesis and increased conversion of the antiviral nucleobase to its nucleoside-5 '-monophosphate, -diphosphate, and -triphosphate forms. The 6MMPr co-treatment specifically increased production of the active antiviral form of the nucleobases (but not corresponding nucleosides) while also reducing levels of competing cellular NTPs to produce the synergistic effect. This in-depth work establishes a foundation for development of small molecules as possible co-treatments with nucleobases like favipiravir in response to emerging RNA virus infections.

TI  - Combination and tricombination therapy to destabilize the structural integrity of COVID-19 by some bioactive compounds with antiviral drugs: insights from molecular docking study
T2  - STRUCTURAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic virus has been spreading throughout the world. Until now, no certified drugs have been discovered to efficiently inhibit the virus. The scientists are struggling to find new safe bioactive inhibitors of this deadly virus. In this study, we aim to find antagonists that may inhibit the activity of the three major viral targets: SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (6LU7), SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (6VYB), and a host target human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (1R42), which is the entry point for the viral encounter, were studied with the prospects of identifying significant drug candidate(s) against COVID-19 infection. Then, the protein stability produced score of less than 0.6 for all residues of all studied receptors. This confirmed that these receptors are extremely stable proteins, so it is very difficult to unstable the stability of these proteins through utilizing individual drugs. Hence, we studied the combination and tricombination therapy between bioactive compounds which have the best binding affinity and some antiviral drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, simeprevir, baloxavir, lopinavir, and favipiravir to show the effect of combination and tricombination therapy to disrupt the stability of the three major viral targets that are mentioned previously. Also, ADMET study suggested that most of all studied bioactive compounds are safe and nontoxic compounds. All results confirmed that caulerpin can be utilized as a combination and tricombination therapy along with the studied antiviral drugs for disrupting the stability of the three major viral receptors (6LU7, 6VYB, and 1R42).

TI  - Pharmacotherapy in COVID-19; A narrative review for emergency providers
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly challenging due to a lack of established therapies and treatment guidelines. With the rapid transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been impeded by limited availability. Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics are being considered for treatment at this time. The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals.
   Objectives: This narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords "COVID 19," "SARS-CoV-2," and "treatment." All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines.
   Discussion: There are currently no therapeutic drugs available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies. Current guidelines recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence. Remdesivir and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Corticosteroids should be avoided unless there is evidence of refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another compelling indication for their use. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever.
   Conclusion: There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development. Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Scoping insight on antiviral drugs against COVID-19
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB  - Background: COVID-19 is an ongoing viral pandemic produced by SARS-CoV-2. In light of in vitro efficacy, several medications were repurposed for its management. During clinical use, many of these medications produced inconsistent results or had varying limitations.
   Objective: The purpose of this literature review is to explain the variable efficacy or limitations of Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, and Favipiravir in clinical settings.
   Method: A study of the literature on the pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), safety profile, and clinical trials through academic databases using relevant search terms.
   Results & discussion: The efficacy of an antiviral drug against COVID-19 is associated with its ability to achieve therapeutic concentration in the lung and intestinal tissues. This efficacy depends on the PK properties, particularly protein binding, volume of distribution, and half-life. The PK and PD of the model drugs need to be integrated to predict their limitations.
   Conclusion: Current antiviral drugs have varying pharmacological constraints that may associate with limited efficacy, especially in severe COVID-19 patients, or safety concerns. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic hit the world lately and caused acute respiratory syndrome in humans. The causative agent of the disease was soon identified by scientists as SARS-CoV-2 and later called a novel coronavirus by the general public. Due to the severity and rapid spread of the disease, WHO classifies the COVID-19 pandemic as the 6th public health emergency even after taking efforts like worldwide quarantine and restrictions. Since only symptomatic treatment is available, the best way to control the spread of the virus is by taking preventive measures. Various types of antigen/antibody detection kits and diagnostic methods are available for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In recent years, various phytochemicals and repurposing drugs showing a broad range of anti-viral activities with different modes of actions have been identified. Repurposing drugs such as arbidol, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, hexamethylene amiloride, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, interferon-P, and neutralizing antibodies exhibit in vitro anti-coronaviral properties by inhibiting multiple processes in the virus life cycle. Various research groups are involved in drug trials and vaccine dematrine, and resveratrol exhibit different modes of action against a wide range of positive/negative sense-RNA/DNA virus, and future researches need to be conducted to ascertain their role and use in managing SARS-CoV-2. Thus this article is an attempt to review the current understanding of COVID19 acute respiratory disease and summarize its clinical features with their prospective control and various aspects of the therapeutic approach.

TI  - Theoretical studies of the rotational and tautomeric states, electronic and spectroscopic properties of favipiravir and its structural analogues: a potential drug for the treatment of COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF TAIBAH UNIVERSITY FOR SCIENCE
AB  - Favipiravir is a broad spectrum antiviral drug that has shown activity against many viruses. Sequel to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, favipiravir is investigated as one of the potential drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. To augment these efforts, this article reports the rotational isomers, tautomeric states, electronic and spectral properties of favipiravir and its five analogues (Cl, Br, H, CN and CH3) using quantum chemcial code. The enol forms are more stable and the calculated keto-enol relative energies are in the range of 7.86-10.72 kcal/mol in the gas phase and 1.07-3.46 kcal/mol in the solution phase. The relative stabilization of the more polar keto structure in water environment leads to a significant reduction in keto-enol relative energy by 68% for T705, 71% for T705-Cl and T705-Br, 86% for T1105 (H), 88% for T705-CN and 80% for T705-CH3. The density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set were used in the computation. The theoretical results were successfully compared with available experimental and theoretical data.

TI  - Favipiravir: Pharmacokinetics and Concerns About Clinical Trials for 2019-nCoV Infection
T2  - CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
AB  - An outbreak of 2019-nCoV infection in China has spread across the world. No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID-2019. In addition to the recommended antiviral drugs, such as interferon-& x251;, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and chloroquine phosphate, some clinical trials focusing on virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors have been registered and initiated. Favipiravir, a purine nucleic acid analog and potent RdRp inhibitor approved for use in influenza, is also considered in several clinical trials. Herein, we summarized the pharmacokinetic characteristics of favipiravir and possible drug-drug interactions from the view of drug metabolism. We hope this will be helpful for the design of clinical trials for favipiravir in COVID-2019, as data regarding in vitro virus inhibition and efficacy in preclinical animal studies are still not available.

TI  - Antiviral drugs proposed for COVID-19: action mechanism and pharmacological data
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As a beta-coronavirus. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has caused one of the most significant historical pandemics, as well as various health and medical challenges. Our purpose in this report is to collect, summarize, and articulate all essential information about antiviral drugs that may or may not be efficient for treating COVID-19. Clinical evidence about these drugs and their possible mechanisms of action are also discussed.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: To conduct a comprehensive review, different keywords in various databases. including Web of Science. Scopus. Medline. PubMed, and Google Scholar, were searched relevant articles, especially the most recent ones. were selected and studied. These selected original research articles, review papers, systematic reviews, and even letters to the editors were then carefully reviewed for data collection.
   RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of the coronavirus family, and there are still no promising therapies or particular antiviral compounds to fight it. After entering the body. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the cells by attaching to specific lung cell receptors, called angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Then, by employing cell division machinery, it replicates through a complex mechanism and spreads throughout the patient's body. Various antiviral drugs. including anti-influenza/HIV/HCV drugs, have been applied for treating COVID-19 patients. Due to the similarity of the structure and transcriptional mechanism of COVID-19 to a number of viruses, some of the listed drugs have been beneficial against SARS-CoV-2. However, the effectiveness of others is in an aura of ambiguity and doubt.
   CONCLUSIONS: Some of the antiviral medications listed and discussed in this article have been effective in the treatment of COVID-19 patients or preventing the virus from spreading further. However, other drugs have to be investigated to reach a reliable conclusion about their effectiveness or ineffectiveness.

TI  - New anti-viral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 instead of favipiravir
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a major problem in the world right now. Currently, all the attention of research centers and governments globally are focused on the investigation of vaccination studies and the discovery of small molecules that inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the treatment of patients. The goal of this study was to locate small molecules to be used against COVID19 instead of favipiravir. Favipiravir analogues were selected as drug candidates from the PubChem web tool. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein was selected as the target protein as favipiravir inhibits this protein in the human body. Initially, the inhibition activity of the studied compounds against RdRp of different virus types was investigated. Then, the inhibition properties of selected drug candidates and favipiravir were examined in detail against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp proteins. It was found that 2-oxo-1H-pyrazine-3-carboxamide performed better than favipiravir in the results of molecular docking, molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PSBA) calculations, and ADME analyses.

AB  - Once the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be pandemic, massive efforts have been launched by researchers around the globe to combat this emerging infectious disease. Here we review the most recent data on the novel SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. We analyzed its etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and current medications. After that, we summarized the promising drug delivery application of nanomaterial-based systems. Their preparation routes, unique advantages over the traditional drug delivery routes and their toxicity though risk analysis were also covered. We also discussed in detail the mechanism of action for one example of drug-loaded nanomaterial drug delivery systems (Avigan-contained nano-emulsions). This review provides insights about employing nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems for the treatment of COVID-19 to increase the bioavailability of current drugs, reducing their toxicity, and to increase their efficiency.

TI  - Favipiravir antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in a hamster model
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Despite no or limited pre-clinical evidence, repurposed drugs are massively evaluated in clinical trials to palliate the lack of antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Here we use a Syrian hamster model to assess the antiviral efficacy of favipiravir, understand its mechanism of action and determine its pharmacokinetics. When treatment is initiated before or simultaneously to infection, favipiravir has a strong dose effect, leading to reduction of infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation of the disease. Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlates with incorporation of a large number of mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity. Antiviral efficacy is achieved with plasma drug exposure comparable with those previously found during human clinical trials. Notably, the highest dose of favipiravir tested is associated with signs of toxicity in animals. Thereby, pharmacokinetic and tolerance studies are required to determine whether similar effects can be safely achieved in humans. Favipiravir has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a variety of RNA viruses. Here the authors investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of different drug dosage in the a Syrian hamster model of infection and, combined with genetic analyses, they show that Favipiravir at high doses decrease viral infectivity while inducing the emergence of mutations in viral genomes, decreasing fitness.

TI  - Structural and molecular basis of the interaction mechanism of selected drugs towards multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies- deciphering the scope of repurposed drugs
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - The repurposing of FDA approved drugs is presently receiving attention for COVID-19 drug discovery. Previous studies revealed the binding potential of several FDA-approved drugs towards specific targets of SARS-CoV-2; however, limited studies are focused on the structural and molecular basis of interaction of these drugs towards multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2. The present study aimed to predict the binding potential of six FDA drugs towards fifteen protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 and propose the structural and molecular basis of the interaction by molecular docking and dynamic simulation. Based on the literature survey, fifteen potential targets of SARS-CoV-2, and six FDA drugs (Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, and Ritonavir) were selected. The binding potential of individual drug towards the selected targets was predicted by molecular docking in comparison with the binding of the same drugs with their usual targets. The stabilities of the bestdocked conformations were confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation and energy calculations. Among the selected drugs, Ritonavir and Lopinavir showed better binding towards the prioritized targets with minimum binding energy (kcal/mol), cluster-RMS, number of interacting residues, and stabilizing forces when compared with the binding of Chloroquine, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine, later drugs demonstrated better binding when compared to the binding with their usual targets. Remdesvir showed better binding to the prioritized targets in comparison with the binding of Chloroquine, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine, but showed lesser binding potential when compared to the interaction between Ritonavir and Lopinavir and the prioritized targets. The structural and molecular basis of interactions suggest that the FDA drugs can be repurposed towards multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2, and the present computational models provide insights on the scope of repurposed drugs against COVID-19.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PHARMACY
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is the human coronavirus and a member of the Coronaviridae family leads to fatal pneumonia cases. Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 attaches to the cells in the human body through binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with the spike (S) protein. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 arised in China in late 2019 and was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). The World Health Organization named the disease caused by this virus as corona virus disease (COVID)-19. SARS-CoV-2 which has human-to-human transmission through droplets, direct contact and aerosol routes have affected more than 10 million people and caused more than 500 thousand deaths. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, sore throat, respiratory distress, lung damage, and diarrhea. In severe cases, mechanical ventilation is required and multiple organ damage is encountered. COVID-19 is diagnosed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique which is applied to saliva and swab samples taken from the nose or nasal cavity. Lung damage is detected by computerized tomography (CT). COVID-19 develops more severely in patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer. While vaccine and drug development studies are continuing all over the world, available antiviral drugs such as umifenovir, remdesivir, favipiravir are also tested against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the plasma donated from the recovered patients are tested for COVID-19 treatment. Additionally, treating the inflammatory conditions developing due to COVID-19 and applying antimicrobial drugs against co-infections are among the current approaches.

TI  - Use of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology in Treatment of Covid-19: A Systematic Review Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL NEGATIVE RESULTS
AB  - Background: The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood, and currently there is currently no definitive drug or treatment against it. So, the drugs used to treat SARS-CoV-2 are mainly based on their effectiveness on previous species of coronaviruses. This review aimed to evaluate the studies performed on the use of the available drugs in the treatment of Covid-19 since the onset of this disease.
   Method: Comprehensive search strategy was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science (IR) and Scopus, Psycinfo, Google Scholar, and national databases, including Scientific Information Database (SID) and Maglran from inception of Covid-19 to June 2022. Studies that reported the effect of different drugs in treatment of Covid-19 patients were included.
   Results: 38 studies (114,552 participants) were included in this systematic review study on used drug treatment of patients with Covid-19 including Remdesivir, HCQ & Chloroquine, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir, Arbidol, Kaletra, Oseltamivir, IVIG & Interferon.
   Conclusions: Remdesivir, HCQ & Chloroquine, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir, Arbidol, Kaletra, Oseltamivir, IVIG & Interferon are the most commonly used drugs in treatment of Covid-19. Although these drugs may be effective in improving the condition of Covid-19 patients in the inflammatory phase, the confirmation of their use requires more extensive clinical research.

TI  - RdRp inhibitors and COVID-19: Is molnupiravir a good option?
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Rapid changes in the viral genome allow viruses to evade threats posed by the host immune response or antiviral drugs, and can lead to viral persistence in the host cells. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an essential enzyme in RNA viruses, which is involved in RNA synthesis through the formation of phosphodiester bonds. Therefore, in RNA viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2, RdRp could be a crucial therapeutic target. The present review discusses the promising application of RdRp inhibitors, previously approved or currently being tested in human clinical trials, in the treatment of RNA virus infections. Nucleoside inhibitors (NIs) bind to the active site of RdRp, while nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) bind to allosteric sites. Given the absence of highly effective drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, the discovery of an efficient treatment for this pandemic is an urgent concern for researchers around the world. We review the evidence for molnupiravir (MK-4482, EIDD-2801), an antiviral drug originally designed for Alphavirus infections, as a potential preventive and therapeutic agent for the management of COVID-19. At the beginning of this pandemic, molnupiravir was in preclinical development for seasonal influenza. When COVID-19 spread dramatically, the timeline for development was accelerated to focus on the treatment of this pandemic. Real time consultation with regulators took place to expedite this program. We summarize the therapeutic potential of RdRp inhibitors, and highlight molnupiravir as a new small molecule drug for COVID-19 treatment.

T2  - BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH IN APPLIED CHEMISTRY
AB  - The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as a serious threat to the world public health is in dire need of finding potential therapeutic agents. Chinese have tested several antiviral and antimalarial drugs as potent inhibitors for the novel virus, such as remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, umifenovir and favipiravir. In this study, we used the molecular docking models to study the binding interactions between these pharmaceuticals, as well as our proposed remdesivir analogue (AZCV-20) with the 3CLpro and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the SARSCoV-2, using MEO and Autodock4 methods. Our study provides insight into the possible role of structural flexibility and efficacy during interactions between 3CLpro, RdRp and the drugs.

TI  - COVID-19 infection and liver injury: Clinical features, biomarkers, potential mechanisms, treatment, and management challenges
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
AB  - It is hypothesized that liver impairment caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection might play a central role in severe clinical presentations. Liver injury is closely associated with severe disease and, even with antiviral drugs, have a poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. In addition to the common hepatobiliary disorders caused by COVID-19, patients with pre-existing liver diseases demand special considerations during the current pandemic. Thus, it is vital that upon clinical presentation, patients with concurrent pre-existing liver disease associated with metabolic dysfunction and COVID-19 be managed properly to prevent liver failure. Careful monitoring and early detection of liver damage through biomarkers after hospitalization for COVID-19 is underscored in all cases, particularly in those with pre-existing metabolic liver injury. The purpose of this study was to determine most recent evidence regarding causality, potential risk factors, and challenges, therapeutic options, and management of COVID-19 infection in vulnerable patients with pre-existing liver injury. This review aims to highlight the current frontier of COVID-19 infection and liver injury and the direction of liver injury in these patients.

TI  - In silico evaluation of food-derived carotenoids against SARS-CoV-2 drug targets: Crocin is a promising dietary supplement candidate for COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic is severely threatening public healthcare systems around the globe. Some supporting therapies such as remdesivir, favipiravir, and ivermectin are still under the process of a clinical trial, it is thus urgent to find alternative treatment and prevention options for SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, although many natural products have been tested and/or suggested for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19, carotenoids as an important class of natural products were underexplored. The dietary supplementation of some carotenoids was already suggested to be potentially effective in the treatment of COVID-19 due to their strong antioxidant properties. In this study, we performed an in silico screening of common food-derived carotenoids against druggable target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 including main protease, helicase, replication complex, spike protein and its mutants for the recent variants of concern, and ADP-ribose phosphatase. Molecular docking results revealed that some of the carotenoids had low binding energies toward multiple receptors. Particularly, crocin had the strongest binding affinity (-10.5 kcal/mol) toward the replication complex of SARS-CoV-2 and indeed possessed quite low binding energy scores for other targets as well. The stability of crocin in the corresponding receptors was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. Our study, therefore, suggests that carotenoids, especially crocin, can be considered an effective alternative therapeutics and a dietary supplement candidate for the prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Practical applications In this study, food-derived carotenoids as dietary supplements have the potential to be used for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico techniques, we aimed at discovering food-derived carotenoids with inhibitory effects against multiple druggable sites of SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking experiments against main protease, helicase, replication complex, spike protein and its mutants for the recent variants of concern, and ADP-ribose phosphatase resulted in a few carotenoids with multitarget inhibitory effects. Particularly, crocin as one of the main components of saffron exhibited strong binding affinities to the multiple drug targets including main protease, helicase, replication complex, mutant spike protein of lineage B.1.351, and ADP-ribose phosphatase. The stability of the crocin complexed with these drug targets was further confirmed through molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, our study provides the preliminary data for the potential use of food-derived carotenoids, particularly crocin, as dietary supplements in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Real-time monitoring of enzyme-catalyzed phosphoribosylation of anti-influenza prodrug favipiravir by time-lapse nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
T2  - NMR IN BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Favipiravir (brand name Avigan), a widely known anti-influenza prodrug, is metabolized by endogenous enzymes of host cells to generate the active form, which exerts inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity; first, favipiravir is converted to its phosphoribosylated form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5 '-monophosphate (favipiravir-RMP), by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). Because this phosphoribosylation reaction is the rate-determining step in the generation of the active metabolite, quantitative and real-time monitoring of the HGPRT-catalyzed reaction is essential to understanding the pharmacokinetics of favipiravir. However, assay methods enabling such monitoring have not been established. F-19- or P-31-based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are powerful techniques for observation of intermolecular interactions, chemical reactions, and metabolism of molecules of interest, given that NMR signals of the heteronuclei sensitively reflect changes in the chemical environment of these moieties. Here, we demonstrated direct, sensitive, target-selective, nondestructive, and real-time observation of HGPRT-catalyzed conversion of favipiravir to favipiravir-RMP by performing time-lapse F-19-NMR monitoring of the fluorine atom of favipiravir. In addition, we showed that P-31-NMR can be used for real-time observation of the identical reaction by monitoring phosphorus atoms of the phosphoribosyl group of favipiravir-RMP and of the pyrophosphate product of that reaction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NMR approaches permit the determination of general parameters of enzymatic activity such as V-max and K-m. This method not only can be widely employed in enzyme assays, but also may be of use in the screening and development of new favipiravir-analog antiviral prodrugs that can be phosphoribosylated more efficiently by HGPRT, which would increase the intracellular concentration of the drug's active form. The techniques demonstrated in this study would allow more detailed investigation of the pharmacokinetics of fluorinated drugs, and might significantly contribute to opening new avenues for widespread pharmaceutical studies.

TI  - Early treatment of Favipiravir in COVID-19 patients without pneumonia: a multicentre, open-labelled, randomized control study
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
AB  - We investigated Favipiravir (FPV) efficacy in mild cases of COVID-19 without pneumonia and its effects towards viral clearance, clinical condition, and risk of COVID-19 pneumonia development. PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients without pneumonia were enrolled (2:1) within 10 days of symptomatic onset into FPV and control arms. The former received 1800 mg FPV twice-daily (BID) on Day 1 and 800 mg BID 5-14 days thereafter until negative viral detection, while the latter received only supportive care. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement, defined by a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of <= 1. 62 patients (41 female) comprised the FPV arm (median age: 32 years, median BMI: 22 kg/m(2)) and 31 patients (19 female) comprised the control arm (median age: 28 years, median BMI: 22 kg/m(2)). The median time to sustained clinical improvement, by NEWS, was 2 and 14 days for FPV and control arms, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 2.77, 95% CI 1.57-4.88, P < .001). The FPV arm also had significantly higher likelihoods of clinical improvement within 14 days after enrolment by NEWS (79% vs. 32% respectively, P < .001). 8 (12.9%) and 7 (22.6%) patients in FPV and control arms developed mild pneumonia at a median (range) of 6.5 (1-13) and 7 (1-13) days after treatment, respectively (P = .316). All recovered well without complications. We can conclude that early treatment of FPV in symptomatic COVID-19 patients without pneumonia was associated with faster clinical improvement.

TI  - COVID19 inhibitors: A prospective therapeutics
T2  - BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB  - The inhibition of viral targets might provide new therapies for coronavirus disease abbreviated as COVID-19. The rational drug design identified as much of the recent discoveries of potent drugs molecule against any targets. This results in an improvement in bindings for better potency and selectivity. The drugs containing ethanolamine/propylamine fragments along with heterocycles have shown potential antiviral results. Similarly, there is the possibility of controlling the COVID-19 infection by nucleotide analogues. Here we also highlight drugs ACEIs/ARBs inhibitory discussing both their advantages and disadvantages. The class of compounds/antibodies inhibiting interleukin-6 works in antirheumatoid drugs are found useful in alleviating overactive inflammatory responses in the lungs of the patient. These inclusion based approaches counter some of the side -effects associated with the heterocycles and also potentiate the efficacy of the molecules. In this review article, design strategies for some of the drugs effective against SARS-CoV-2 are represented. The review also focuses on the listing of drugs that are currently testing under clinical trials for the COVID-19 virus with their mechanism of action. This conversation undertakes the opportunity to do a bit for the newer researchers working in this arena.

TI  - Tocilizumab and PMX-DHP have efficacy for severe COVID-19 pneumonia
T2  - SAGE OPEN MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
AB  - In coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, a cytokine storm resulting from an excessive inflammatory response to the viral infection is thought to play a role in the exacerbation of the pneumonia and its prognosis. Favipiravir and ciclesonide are not effective in the inhibition of the cytokine storm. In this case report, we describe the experience of tocilizumab administration and polymyxin B immobilized fiber direct hemoperfusion in severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia patient. A 52-year-old man presented with fever and dyspnea and was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia based on a polymerase chain reaction test. Mechanical ventilation and favipiravir administration were started for respiratory failure. However, favipiravir could not be continued due to hepatic dysfunction. Consequently, tocilizumab was administered, and continuous hemodiafiltration and endotoxin adsorption therapy (polymyxin B immobilized fiber direct hemoperfusion) were performed for acute renal failure. C-reactive protein decreased from 44 to 3.52 mg/dL, and the patient's respiratory status improved over time, enabling mechanical ventilation to be withdrawn. This case indicates that adding polymyxin B immobilized fiber direct hemoperfusion to tocilizumab administration may further increase efficacy in coronavirus disease 2019 treatment; however, more case-control studies are needed.

TI  - COVID-19 AND DERMATOLOGY (PART II): ADVERSE MUCOCUTANEOUS REACTIONS TO MEDICATIONS AND VACCINES USED FOR COVID-19 INFECTION
T2  - ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
AB  - Background/Aim: There is no proven specific or effective treatment for COVID-19 infection; therefore, many drugs are used empirically to establish control of the infection. Viral infection creates an immunologic environment and facilitate drug sensitization. With the advent of new vaccines, the future holds promise for optimism in establishing control of the pandemic. However, even vaccines are not devoid of side effects. In part II of these review series, we aimed to review the published data on mucocutaneous reactions induced by medications used for COVID-19 infection and vaccines used for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Materials and methods: Literature search was performed in the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for the relevant studies, starting from the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic until October 2021. Research on animals, studies utilizing in vitro techniques and publications irrelevant to the study's framework were excluded. Results: The mucocutaneous side effects liable to medications (antimalarials, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, ribavirin/interferon, oseltamivir/favipiravir, darunavir, imatinib, tocilizumab, anakinra baricitinib, and other Janus kinase inhibitors, immunoglobulin therapy, colchicine, anti-TNF-alpha biologics, low molecular weight heparins, camostat mesylate) and vaccines used for COVID-19 infection are reviewed herein. Conclusion: There is a great amount of accumulated data regarding the mucocutaneous side effects of drugs and vaccines used for COVID-19 infection. In the pandemic era, it is a major goal to diagnose drug or vaccine-related mucocutaneous eruptions and distinguish them from pathognomonic, specific, or SARS-CoV-2 virus-related cutaneous eruptions. Timely diagnosis of a mucocutaneous drug/ vaccine reaction will allow for identi???cation of the culprit and appropriate management and protect the patient from forthcoming severe drug/ vaccine reactions. Therefore, it is essential for physicians to update their knowledge regularly on mucocutaneous side effects of COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines.

TI  - Potential treatment methods targeting 2019-nCoV infection
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - The novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has quickly spread across the world and pose serious threat to public health because it can infect people very easily. The major clinical symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection include fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue, and diarrhea. The 2019-nCoV belongs to the betacoronavirus family, and gene sequencing results demonstrate that it is a single-stranded RNA virus, closely related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). It has been observed that the virus invades human body mainly through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors similar to SARS-CoV and the main protease (Mpro) acts as a critical protease for digesting the polyprotein into functional polypeptides during the replication and transcription process of 2019-nCoV. In this review, we summarized the real-time information of 2019-nCoV treatment methods and mainly focused on the chemical drugs including lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir and other potential innovative active molecules. Their potential targets, activity, clinical status and side effects are described. In addition, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) and biological reagents available, as well as the promising vaccine candidates against 2019-nCoV are also discussed.

The objective of this pilot study was to compare three arms: favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; standard care (no specific SARS-CoV-2 treatment) only, in symptomatic patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in an open-labelled randomized clinical trial. The trial was registered with Bahrain National Taskforce for Combatting COVID-19 on the 7th of May 2020 (registration code: NCT04387760). 150 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 disease were randomized into one of three arms: favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, or standard care only. The primary outcome was the clinical scale at the end of study follow up (day 14 or on discharge/death) based on a points scale. The secondary outcomes were viral clearance, biochemical parameter changes and mortality at 30-days. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. The proportion of patients who achieved a clinical scale < 2 did not differ between groups. The favipiravir-treated and hydroxychloroquine-treated group showed increased viral clearance (OR, 95%CI 2.38, 0.83-6.78, OR, 95%CI 2.15, 0.78-5.92, respectively) compared to standard care, but this was not significant. The biochemical profile did not differ between groups, except for the platelet count (P < 0.03) and uric acid (P < 0.004) that were higher with favipiravir-treatment. Primary or secondary outcome measures did not differ between favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, and standard therapy for mild to moderate COVID-19 disease; therefore, whilst favipiravir therapy appeared safe with a trend to increased viral clearance, there was no superior therapeutic utility. Clinical trials registration. NCT04387760. Registration date: 07/05/2020.

TI  - Functionalized Nanoparticles in Prevention and Targeted Therapy of Viral Diseases With Neurotropism Properties, Special Insight on COVID-19
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Neurotropic viruses have neural-invasive and neurovirulent properties to damage the central nervous system (CNS), leading to humans' fatal symptoms. Neurotropic viruses comprise a lot of viruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), rabies virus (RABV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Effective therapy is needed to prevent infection by these viruses in vivo and in vitro. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) usually prevents macromolecules from entering the CNS, which challenges the usage of the traditional probes, antiviral drugs, or neutralizing antibodies in the CNS. Functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) have been increasingly reported in the targeted therapy of neurotropic viruses due to their sensitivity and targeting characteristics. Therefore, the present review outlines efficient functionalized NPs to further understand the recent trends, challenges, and prospects of these materials.

TI  - Pulmonary delivery of favipiravir inhalation solution for COVID-19 treatment: in vitro characterization, stability, in vitro cytotoxicity, and antiviral activity using real time cell analysis
T2  - DRUG DELIVERY
AB  - Favipiravir, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor, is used to treat patients infected with influenza virus and most recently with SARS-CoV-2. However, poor accumulation of favipiravir in lung tissue following oral administration has required an alternative method of administration that directly targets the lungs. In this study, an inhalation solution of favipiravir at a concentration of 2 mg mL(-1) was developed and characterized for the first time. The chemical stability of inhaled favipiravir solution in two different media, phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and normal saline (NS), was investigated under different conditions: 5 +/- 3 degrees C, 25 +/- 2 degrees C/60% RH +/- 5% RH, and 40 +/- 2 degrees C/75% RH +/- 5% RH; in addition to constant light exposure. As a result, favipiravir solution in PBS revealed superior stability over 12 months at 5 +/- 3 degrees C. Antiviral activity of favipiravir was assessed at the concentrations between 0.25 and 3 mg mL(-1) with real time cell analyzer on Vero-E6 that were infected with SARS-CoV-2/B.1.36. The optimum concentration was found to be 2 mg mL(-1), where minimum toxicity and sufficient antiviral activity was observed. Furthermore, cell viability assay against Calu-3 lung epithelial cells confirmed the biocompatibility of favipiravir at concentrations up to 50 mu M (7.855 mg mL(-1)). The in vitro aerodynamic profiles of the developed inhaled favipiravir formulation, when delivered with soft-mist inhaler indicated good lung targeting properties. These results suggest that favipiravir solution prepared with PBS could be considered as a suitable and promising inhalation formulation for pulmonary delivery in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Psychopharmacological treatment in COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - KLINIK PSIKIYATRI DERGISI-TURKISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - The COVID-19 infection is still active both worldwide and in our country. Hereafter, it is going to have marked effects on clinical psychiatric practice. So, it is very important to consider the interactions of psychotropic drugs used in the COVID-19 pandemic in patients receiving psychiatric treatment or planned to start psychiatric treatment. There is still no cure for COVID-19 infection and treatment algorithms change over time. Moreover, studies on drug interactions between the drugs used in COVID-19 treatment and psychotropic drugs to guide the clinician are limited. In this regard, it is thought that it is important for psychiatrists to keep up with the current literature knowledge while planning psychotropic medication during the pandemic process, which is expected to continue for a long time. In this article, the mechanisms of action and interactions of frequently used drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 with psychotropic drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, tocilizumab and azithromycin are reviewed. Also regardless of drug interactions, the antiviral effects of chlorpromazine and lithium and their place in the potential treatment of COVID-19 are mentioned and potential problems that psychiatric therapies may cause in these patients are discussed.

TI  - Association of Early Favipiravir Use with Reduced COVID-19 Fatality among Hospitalized Patients
T2  - INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Background: The antiviral agent favipiravir is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor.
   Materials and Methods: We examined patients with a clinical, laboratory, and radiological diagnosis of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. We investigated the effect of administering enteral favipiravir at a 2 x 1,600 mg loading dose and 2 x 600 mg maintenance dose for 5 days in addition to the standard COVID-19 treatment.
   Results: In total, 180 patients, who were hospitalized at the Istanbul Tuzla State Hospital and received favipiravir treatment between March 20, 2020 and May 30, 2020, were examined. Of these, 47 patients died. Thirty-three of the patients who died were aged over 65 years (70%), indicating that fatality was higher in elderly patients. Most of those who died had at least one comorbidity. Of the 101 patients who initiated favipiravir within <= 3 days of hospitalization, 17 died (17%). Of the 79 patients who initiated favipiravir after >3 days of hospitalization, 30 died (38%) (P = 0.002).
   Conclusion: We found that initiation of favipiravir within the first 72 h after the onset of disease symptoms reduced fatality in patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Adverse effects associated with favipiravir in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: a retrospective study
T2  - SAO PAULO MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - BACKGROUND: Favipiravir is generally used in treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in Turkey. OBJECTIVE: To determine the side effects of favipiravir and whether it is a good treatment option. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective study conducted in Ataturk Chest Diseases and Chest Surgery Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. METHODS: 357 patients who completed favipiravir treatment at the recommended dose were included. 37 patients with drug side effects and 320 patients without drug side effects were examined in two groups. RESULTS: Side effects were observed in 37 (10.36%) out of 357 patients using favipiravir. The most common side effect was liver dysfunction, in 26 (7.28%) of the patients. The following other side effects were also observed: diarrhea (1.4%), nausea (0.84%), abdominal pain (0.28%) and thrombocytopenia (0.28%). One patient (0.28%) presented both increased transaminases and nausea. CONCLUSION: In this study, it was determined that favipiravir may constitute an alternative for treating COVID-19 pneumonia given that its side effects are generally well tolerated and not serious.

TI  - The effect of favipiravir on QTc interval in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background: The effect of favipiravir on the QTc interval during the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is unclear. Thus, the current study objective was to evaluate any change in the QTc interval in patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 receiving favipiravir treatment.
   Method: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were assessed in this single-center retrospective study. 189 patients, whose diagnosis was confirmed using real-time PCR, were included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups: those using hydroxychloroquine (Group 1, n = 66), hydroxychloroquine plus favipiravir (Group 2, n = 66), and favipiravir only (Group 3, n = 57). The QTc interval was measured before treatment (QTc-B) and 48 h after (i.e., the median) starting treatment (QTc-AT).
   Results: The median age was 53 (39-66 IQR) and 97 (51%) of patients were female. The median QTc(Bazett)change was 7 ms (p = 0.028) and 12 ms (p < 0.001) and in Group 1 and 2, respectively. In Group 3, the median QTc(Bazett)-change was observed as -3 ms and was not statistically significant (p = 0.247). In multivariable analysis, while there was a significant relationship between QTc-AT(Bazett) and hydroxychloroquine (3 coefficient = 2687, 95%CI 2599-16,976, p = 0,008), there was no significant relationship with favipiravir (3 coefficient = 0,180, 95% CI-6435-7724, p = 0,858). Similarly, there was a significant relationship between the QTc-AT interval calculated using the Fredericia formula and hydroxychloroquine (3 coefficient = 2120, 95% CI 0,514-14,398, p = 0,035), but not with favipiravir (3 coefficient = 0,111, 95% CI -64507221, p = 0,911).
   Conclusion: In the ECG recordings received in the following days after the treatment was started in COVID-19 patients, there was a significant prolongation in the QTc interval with hydroxychloroquine, but there was no significant change with favipiravir.

TI  - The combined treatment of Molnupiravir and Favipiravir results in a potentiation of antiviral efficacy in a SARS-CoV-2 hamster infection model
T2  - EBIOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Favipiravir and Molnupiravir, orally available antivirals, have been reported to exert antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. First efficacy data have been recently reported in COVID-19 patients.
   Methods: We here report on the combined antiviral effect of both drugs in a SARS-CoV-2 Syrian hamster infection model. The infected hamsters were treated twice daily with the vehicle (the control group) or a suboptimal dose of each compound or a combination of both compounds.
   Findings: When animals were treated with a combination of suboptimal doses of Molnupiravir and Favipiravir at the time of infection, a marked combined potency at endpoint is observed. Infectious virus titers in the lungs of animals treated with the combination are reduced by similar to 5 log10 and infectious virus are no longer detected in the lungs of >60% of treated animals. When start of treatment was delayed with one day a reduction of titers in the lungs of 2.4 log10 was achieved. Moreover, treatment of infected animals nearly completely prevented transmission to co-housed untreated sentinels. Both drugs result in an increased mutation frequency of the remaining viral RNA recovered from the lungs of treated animals. In the combo treated hamsters, an increased frequency of C-to-T mutations in the viral RNA is observed as compared to the single treatment groups which may explain the pronounced antiviral potency of the combination. Interpretation: Our findings may lay the basis for the design of clinical studies to test the efficacy of the combination of Molnupiravir/Favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - A Review of Potential Antiviral Drugs and Vaccines to Treat COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a challenge to the whole humanity. COVID-19 was first reported in China and rigorous researches are going on for developing vaccine for the pandemic. This review was prepared by following PRISMA guidelines and used the resources from the Web of Science and PubMed. This research focuses on the niches of symptoms and vaccines for COVID-19. The research for vaccine involves research for new vaccine and drug repurposing. Out of various drug repurposing options, Remdesivir, and Favipiravir, Chloroquine and Lopinavir/Ritonavir were found to be the popular ones for treating COVID-19 patients across the world. Even though there are concerns regarding asymptotic patients, the most dominant symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough, followed by Dyspnoea and muscle ache. This review concludes that the COVID-19 related research should focus on developing immunity vaccines, and repurposing of drugs. Research on the problems of quarantine life, patient monitoring, and usage of information technology in facing COVID-19 will improve the quality of patient handling during the pandemic. The research on the effectiveness of various models of lockdown and regulation of social life during lockdown periods, improving the safety of health care workers in the workplace will definitely help the governments in their fight against COVID-19.

TI  - An update of anti-viral treatment of COVID-19
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background/aim: Currently there is not an effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19, but a large number of drugs have been evaluated since the beginning of the pandemic, and many of them have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 despite the preliminary or conflicting results of the clinical trials. We aimed to review and summarize all of the current knowledge on the antivirals for COVID-19.
   Results: There are 2 main drug groups for SARS-CoV-2: agents that target proteins or RNA of the virus or interfere with proteins or biological processes in the host that support the virus. The main drug groups include inhibitors of viral entry into the human cell (convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, nanobodies, mini proteins, human soluble ACE-2, camostat, dutasteride, proxalutamide, bromhexin, hydroxychloroquine, umifenovir nitazoxanid, niclosamide, lactoferrin), inhibitors of viral proteases (lopinavir/ritonavir, PF-07321332, PF-07304814, GC376), inhibitors of viral RNA (remdesivir, favipiravir, molnupiravir, AT-527, merimepodib, PTC299), inhibitors of host proteins supporting virus (plitidepsin, fluvoxamine, ivermectin), and agents supporting host natural immunity (Interferons).
   Conclusion: When taking into account the results of all the available laboratory and clinical trials on the subject, monoclonal antibodies seem to be the most effective treatment for COVID-19 at the moment, and high-titer convalescent plasma also could be effective when administered during the early phase of the disease. As lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, merimepodib, and umifenovir were found to be ineffective in RCTs, they should not be used. Additional studies are needed to define the role of remdesivir, favipiravir, interferons, ivermectin, dutasteride, proxulutamide, fluvoxamine, bromhexine, nitazoxanide, and niclosamid in the treatment of COVID-19. Finally, the results of phase trials are waited to learn whether or not the newer agents such as molnupiravir, PF-07321332, PF-07304814, plitidepsin and AT-527 are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Favipiravir and Hydroxychloroquine Combination Therapy in Patients with Moderate to Severe COVID-19 (FACCT Trial): An Open-Label, Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Trial
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THERAPY
AB  - Introduction Antiviral drugs have shown limited effectiveness in treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to assess the effects of a favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine combination on treating moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients. Methods An investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial at nine hospitals. Eligible patients were adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 defined as oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) of <= 94% while breathing ambient air or significant clinical symptoms with chest x-ray changes requiring hospital admission. Randomization was in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard care (control group) or standard care plus favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. The primary outcome was time to clinical improvement of two points (from the status at randomization) on a seven-category ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital within 14 days. Analyses were done in an intention-to-treat population. Results From May 2020 to Jan 2021, 254 patients were enrolled; 129 were assigned to standard of care and 125 to the treatment. The mean age was 52 (+/- 13) years, and 103 (41%) were women. At randomization, six patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation, 229 (90.15%) were requiring supplemental oxygen only (with or without non-invasive ventilation), and 19 (7.48%) were receiving neither. The time to clinical improvement was not significantly different between the groups: median of 9 days in the treatment group and 7 days in the control group (HR: 0.845; 95% CI 0.617-1.157; p-value = 0.29). The 28-day mortality was not significantly different between the groups (7.63% treatment) vs. (10.32% control); p-value = 0.45. The most prevalent adverse events were headache, elevation in ALT, and the prolonged QTc interval in the treatment group. Conclusion The combination of favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine did not result in a statistically significant clinical benefit in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

TI  - Elevation of Serum Transaminase Levels Due to Favipiravir Use in the Treatment of COVID-19
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background and aims: Favipiravir is a ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) inhibitor antiviral agent used in the treatment of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we investigated the changes in serum transaminase levels of patients and the relationship between serum transaminase elevation with mortality in patients who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 and received favipiravir treatment.
   Materials and methods: 454 patients who received favipiravir and 113 patients who did not receive favipiravir were evaluated. Serum transaminase levels of the patients were compared at baseline and after five days of treatment, and the relationship between serum transaminase elevation and mortality was investigated.
   Results: No significant aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation was detected due to favipiravir treatment. AST elevation was found, respectively, as 133 (29.3%), 32 (28.3%) (p=0.100), ALT elevation as 112 (24.7%), 35 (29.3%) (p=0.100) in the groups receiving and not receiving favipiravir. High AST level was found as a risk factor for mortality in all patient groups (p=0.008).
   Conclusions: There was no statistically significant elevation in serum transaminase levels due to favipiravir use in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. A high level of AST is a significant risk factor to show mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic modelling to estimate intracellular favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5 '-triphosphate exposure to support posology for SARS-CoV-2
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Objectives: Favipiravir has discrepant activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, concerns about teratogenicity and pill burden, and an unknown optimal dose. This analysis used available data to simulate the intracellular pharmacokinetics of the favipiravir active metabolite [favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (FAVI-RTP)].
   Methods: Published in vitro data for intracellular production and elimination of FAVI-RTP in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were fitted with a mathematical model describing the time course of intracellular FAVI-RTP as a function of favipiravir concentration. Parameter estimates were then combined with a published population pharmacokinetic model in Chinese patients to predict human intracellular FAVI-RTP. In vitro FAVI-RTP data were adequately described as a function of concentrations with an empirical model, noting simplification and consolidation of various processes and several assumptions.
   Results: Parameter estimates from fittings to in vitro data predict a flatter dynamic range of peak to trough for intracellular FAVI-RTP (peak to trough ratio of similar to 1 to 1) when driven by a predicted free plasma concentration profile, compared with the plasma profile of parent favipiravir (ratio of similar to 2 to 1). This approach has important assumptions, but indicates that, despite rapid clearance of the parent from plasma, sufficient intracellular FAVI-RTP may be maintained across the dosing interval because of its long intracellular half-life.
   Conclusions: Population mean intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations are estimated to be maintained above the Km for the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase for 9 days with a 1200 mg twice-daily regimen (following a 1600 mg twice-daily loading dose on day 1). Further evaluation of favipiravir as part of antiviral combinations for SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.

TI  - A Comprehensive Review on the Efficacy of Several Pharmacologic Agents for the Treatment of COVID-19
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary Treatments for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have utilized a variety of medications, including antivirals, immunomodulators, and other therapeutics such as antibiotics, stem cells, and plasma therapy. Each COVID-19 treatment option has advantages and disadvantages. The therapeutic effects of each medication used to treat COVID-19 patients are discussed in this review. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization to some of the proposed treatment medicines for COVID-19 patients. Lopinavir/ ritonavir, favipiravir, ivermectin, nirmatrelvir, interferons, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, sarilumab, siltuximab, canakinumab, colchicine, tofacitinib, thalidomide, convalescent plasma therapy, and mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to have positive effects to treat COVID-19 patients, while anakinra, ruxolitinib, and azithromycin have proven ineffective for COVID-19 therapy; however, no solid conclusion has been obtained from the results of different clinical trials. Therefore, further randomized trials are required to support the validation of their utility. However, most studies concluded that utilizing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients had no effect and advised against doing so. This study helps choose appropriate COVID-19 medications in different nations and advances our knowledge of these drugs' clinical efficacy. SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), and the cause of the pandemic is extremely contagious among people and has spread around the world. Antivirals, immunomodulators, and other medications, such as antibiotics, stem cells, and plasma therapy, have all been utilized in the treatment of COVID-19. To better understand the clinical efficacy of these agents and to aid in the selection of effective COVID-19 therapies in various countries, this study reviewed the effectiveness of the various pharmacologic agents that have been used for COVID-19 therapy globally by summarizing the clinical outcomes that have been obtained from the clinical trials published on each drug related to COVID-19 infection. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the use of remdesivir, paxlovid, molnupiravir, baricitinib, tixagevimab-cilgavimab, and bebtelovimab for the management of COVID-19. On the other hand, most research advises against using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients because they are not beneficial. Although the FDA has given emergency use authorization for some monoclonal antibodies, including bamlanivimab, etesevimab, casirivimab, and imdevimab for managing COVID-19, they are not currently approved for use because the Omicron variant has significantly reduced their in vitro susceptibility. In this study, we also included a wide range of alternative therapy strategies that effectively treat COVID-19 patients, although further randomized studies are necessary to support and assess their applicability.

TI  - Approaches for prevention and environmental management of novel COVID-19
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of a new form of pneumonia. It was subsequently named COVID-19 and reported as the source of a respiratory disease occurrence starting in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It has been affirmed a public health emergency of international significance by the World Health Organization. It is regarded as a subset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); COVID-19 is triggered by a betacoronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, which affects the lower respiratory tract and occurs in humans as pneumonia. A variety of drugs, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate for the management of COVID-19. The effect of the pandemic as well as the epidemic that follows through the life cycles of various recycled plastic is evaluated, particularly those required for personal safety and health care. In response to the growth in COVID-19 cases worldwide, the energy and environmental impacts of these lifecycle management have risen rapidly. However, significant hazardous waste management concerns arise due to the need to assure the elimination of residual pathogens in household and medical wastes. This review article summarizes the preventive and environmental management of COVID-19.

TI  - Real-World Experience with Favipiravir for the Treatment of Mild-to-Moderate COVID-19 in India
T2  - PRAGMATIC AND OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Favipiravir, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor (RdRp), is a broad-spectrum oral antiviral agent approved in India under emergency use authorization, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The present study was planned to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of favipiravir in real-world clinical practice.
   Materials and Methods: This was a multicentric, retrospective, single-arm study conducted across four centres in India, after obtaining permission from the independent ethics committee. Medical records were analysed to evaluate effectiveness and safety of patients who were prescribed favipiravir.
   Results: The medical records of a total of 360 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 358 of them available for the final analysis. Males made up 58.46% of the study population. The average age of enrolled patients was 51.80 +/- 16.45 years. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and myalgia-fatigue. The median time to clinical cure and fever relief was five and four days, respectively. The average length of stay in the hospital was six days. In total, 8% of the patients experienced adverse events. Hepatic enzyme elevation, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, headache, fatigue, and giddiness were the common symptoms.
   Conclusion: In our real-world study, favipiravir was found to have a clinical cure rate of more than 90% in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. This supports the use of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19. Favipiravir was well tolerated, with only minimal side effects, which were transient in nature.

TI  - Two Cases of Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia Effectively Treated with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Addition to Favipiravir and Corticosteroid
T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Case 1: A 65-year-old man with novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) complicated with acute respiratory failure. On admission, the patient was started on favipiravir and corticosteroid. However, due to a lack of significant improvement, he was introduced to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Although iliopsoas hematoma occurred as a complication, the patient recovered. Case 2: A 49-year-old man with COVID-19 had been started on favipiravir and corticosteroid. Due to progressive respiratory failure, the patient underwent mechanical ventilation and ECMO. The patient recovered without complications. We successfully treated these severe cases with a multimodal combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological supportive therapy.

T2  - BIOINFORMATION
AB  - Design and development of effective anti-virals in combating CoVid-19 is a great challenge worldwide. Known drugs such as chloroquine, lopinavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are used in the management of CoVid-19. It is known that Ivermectin and remdesivir both are effective against filoviruses, paramyxo viruses. Available data also shows that ivermectin and remedesivir repress the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we document the potential use of ivermectin and remdesivir in the management of CoVid-19.

TI  - Favipiravir, camostat, and ciclesonide combination therapy in patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with/without oxygen therapy: An open- label, single-center phase 3 randomized clinical trial
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
AB  - Background The effectiveness of combination therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia remains unclear. We evaluated favipiravir, camostat, and ciclesonide combination therapy in patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods In this open-label phase 3 study, hospitalized adults who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and had COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled prior to official vaccination drive in Japan. Participants were randomly assigned to favipiravir monotherapy or favipiravir + camostat + ciclesonide combination therapy. The primary outcome was the length of hos-pitalization due to COVID-19 infection after study treatment. The hospitalization period was calculated from the time of admission to the time of patient discharge using the clinical management guide of COVID-19 for front-line health-care workers developed by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (Version 3). Cases were registered between November 11, 2020, and May 31, 2021. Japan Registry of Clinical Trials registration: jRCTs031200196. Findings Of 121 enrolled patients, 56 received monotherapy and 61 received combination therapy. Baseline characteris-tics were balanced between the groups. The median time of hospitalization was 10 days for the combination and 11 days for the monotherapy group. The median time to discharge was statistically significantly lower in the combination therapy vs monotherapy group (HR, 1.67 (95% CI 1.03-2.7; P = 0.035). The hospital discharge rate was statistically significantly higher in the combination therapy vs monotherapy group in patients with less severe COVID-19 infections and those who were <= 60 years. There were no significant differences in clinical findings between the groups at 4, 8, 11, 15, and 29 days. Adverse events were comparable between the groups. There were two-deaths, with one in each group. Interpretation Combination oral favipiravir, camostat and, ciclesonide therapy could decrease the length of hospital-zation stays without safety concerns in patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. However, lack of hard clinical primary outcome is one of the major limitations of the study. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Immune Therapy, or Antiviral Therapy, or Both for COVID-19: A Systematic Review
T2  - DRUGS
AB  - Background Based on current evidence, recent guidelines of the National Institute of Health, USA indicated the use of remdesivir and dexamethasone for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease, not requiring high-flow oxygen. No therapeutic agent directed against the immunologic pathogenic mechanisms related to the cytokine release syndrome complicating the disease was indicated. Objectives The purpose of this review was to assess the clinical impact of different therapies for COVID-19; thus, helping to identify the optimal management of the disease. To explain the rationale for the different therapeutic approaches, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and the immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. Methods The efficacy assessment of the different treatments was performed by a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Available English language published articles including randomised controlled trials, open-label trials of antivirals and immune therapies extracted from Medline, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv databases were analysed. For inclusion, the primary end point of the trials had to be the efficacy as measured by the improvement of clinical features, or mortality, or the Intensive Care Unit Admission rate, or the discharge number. Case reports, paediatric studies, and studies without control group were excluded. The literature search was extended up to August 15, 2020. Results After the removal of duplicate articles, and the exclusion of studies not meeting the eligibility criteria, 2 trials of lopinavir/ritonavir, 1 of favipiravir, 3 of remdesivir, 1 of dexamethasone, 3 of hydroxychloroquine, 2 of colchicine, 6 of tocilizumab, 1 of sarilumab, 1 of siltuximab, 2 of anakinra, 3 of baricitinib, 1 of ruxolitinib, 1 of mavrilimumab, and 1 of itolizumab were suitable for the review. Among antivirals, only remdesivir significantly reduced the time to recovery, and mortality. Data for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were largely inconclusive. In a large trial, dexamethasone 6 mg/day reduced mortality by one-third. Trials of tocilizumab and sarilumab did not definitively demonstrate efficacy. Anakinra significantly reduced the mortality in 2 trials. Three retrospective trials on a cumulative number of 145 patients, reported the efficacy of baricitinib, with significant reduction of intensive care unit admission, and deaths. These results were recently confirmed by the ACTT-2 trial. Due to paucity of studies and to the small size clinical series, the results of other immune therapies were not conclusive. Conclusions Beyond the supportive therapy, up to now the best therapeutic approach for COVID-19 may be a three-step combination therapy, including remdesivir 100 mg/day (200 mg loading dose on first day) in the first stage of the disease, and combined dexamethasone 6 mg/day plus baricitinib 4 mg/day to target the immune dysregulation triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The promising results of anakinra should be confirmed by the ongoing RCTs.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine as FDA-approved drugs for treatment of COVID-19 using synchronous spectrofluorimetry: application to pharmaceutical formulations and biological fluids
T2  - LUMINESCENCE
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious viral infection caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. It has ravaged several countries and burdened many healthcare systems. As the process of authorizing a novel treatment for human use is extensive and involves multiple phases to obtain safety information and identify potential concerns. Therefore, the fastest and easiest choice was to use United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA)-approved drugs such as favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. For the simultaneous estimation of both medications, a simple synchronous spectrofluorimetric approach was established in which both drugs were measured at 372 and 323 nm, respectively in the presence of each other without interference at Delta lambda 60 nm. The effect of various experimental conditions on synchronous fluorescence intensities were thoroughly investigated and optimized. The maximum synchronous fluorescence intensities were obtained at pH 5.4 using acetate buffer (0.2 M, 0.5 ml) and ethanol as a diluent. Excellent linearity ranges were obtained using 1.0-18.0 ng/ml and 10.0-120.0 ng/ml for favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine, respectively. The approach exhibited high sensitivity with detection limits down to 0.25 ng/ml and 1.52 ng/ml and quantitation limits down to 0.77 ng/ml and 4.62 ng/ml, respectively. Spiking human plasma samples with the studied drugs yielded high % recoveries, allowing a significant bioanalytical application. Moreover, the method was validated according to International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and further applied to commercial pharmaceutical preparations with good results.

T2  - ANALYTICAL SCIENCES
AB  - An in-hospital rapid method for quantifying the serum level of favipiravir (FPV) in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 was developed by an appropriate combination of a solid-phase extraction treatment and a reversed-phase HPLC/UV detection system. The quantification method was well-validated and applied to measuring the serum FPV level in a clinical practice at a general hospital that accepts COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, an analysis of data from our preliminary interaction analysis revealed, for the first time, that FPV selectively forms complexes with ferric (Fe3+) and cupric (Cu2+) ions.

TI  - A complementary critical appraisal on systematic reviews regarding the most efficient therapeutic strategies for the current COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
AB  - Background: This critical appraisal aims to clarify which systematic reviews on COVID-19 treatment are based on high-value evidence. Hereby, the most profitable medicines can be suggested.
   Methods: The mesh terms of "COVID-19 drug treatment" (Supplementary Concept) and "COVID-19 drug treatment" were sequentially utilized as search strategies in Medline and Science direct on October 18, 2020. Searches were confined to systematic reviews/meta-analyses. The Cochrane database was searched on November 1, 2020 with "COVID." With adding up four articles from other resources, 84 systematic reviews were considered for initial screening. Finally, 22 articles fulfilled the criteria and were assessed using PRISMA guidelines.
   Results: Increasing number of clinical trials from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not only profitable but also deleterious. Lopinavir/ritonavir failed to maintain their initial efficacy in improving clinical symptoms and mortality rate. Steroids and tocilizumab were suggested in patients with intensely severe symptoms. Steroids reduced mechanical ventilation and death in severely ill patients. Plasma or immunoglobulins effects are absolutely controversial. Favorable impressions of remdesivir have been relied on for the early onset of this drug. Hypotension and abnormal liver function tests were realized as its side effects. Favipiravir has resulted in a higher viral clearance than remdesivir. However, this claim needs to be proved with subsequent clinical trials.
   Conclusions: Currently, remdesivir and favipiravir are advantageous drugs that should be administered in the early phases. Their side effects are not well known and need to be found in the following research projects. Steroids and tocilizumab have been considered beneficial in the cytokine storm phase.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) targeting: an in silico perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - New treatment against SARS-CoV-2 now is a must. Nowadays, the world encounters a huge health crisis by the COVID-19 viral infection. Nucleotide inhibitors gave a lot of promising results in terms of its efficacy against different viral infections. In this work, molecular modeling, docking, and dynamics simulations are used to build a model for the viral protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and test its binding affinity to some clinically approved drugs and drug candidates. Molecular dynamics is used to equilibrate the system upon binding calculations to ensure the successful reproduction of previous results, to include the dynamics of the RdRp, and to understand how it affects the binding. The results show the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Cefuroxime, Tenofovir, and Hydroxychloroquine, in binding to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Additionally, Setrobuvir, YAK, and IDX-184, show better results, while four novel IDX-184 derivatives show promising results in attaching to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. There is an urgent need to specify drugs that can selectively bind and subsequently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The availability of a punch of FDA-approved anti-viral drugs can help us in this mission, aiming to reduce the danger of COVID-19. The compounds 2 and 3 may tightly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and so may be successful in the treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Background: We examined the safety and efficacy of a treatment protocol containing Favipiravir for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
   Methods: We did a multicenter randomized open-labeled clinical trial on moderate to severe cases infections of SARS-CoV-2. Patients with typical ground glass appearance on chest computerized tomography scan (CT scan) and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) of less than 93% were enrolled. They were randomly allocated into Favipiravir (1.6 gr loading, 1.8 gr daily) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (800/200 mg daily) treatment regimens in addition to standard care. In-hospital mortality, ICU admission, intubation, time to clinical recovery, changes in daily SpO(2) after 5 min discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, and length of hospital stay were quantified and compared in the two groups.
   Results: 380 patients were randomly allocated into Favipiravir (193) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (18 7) groups in 13 centers. The number of deaths, intubations, and ICU admissions were not significantly different (26, 27, 31 and 21, 17, 25 respectively). Mean hospital stay was also not different (7.9 days [SD = 6] in the Favipiravir and 8.1 [SD = 6.5] days in Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups) (p = 0.61). Time to clinical recovery in the Favipiravir group was similar to Lopinavir/Ritonavir group (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 - 1.17) and likewise the changes in the daily SpO(2) after discontinuation of supplemental oxygen (p = 0.46)
   Conclusion: Adding Favipiravir to the treatment protocol did not reduce the number of ICU admissions or intubations or In-hospital mortality compared to Lopinavir/Ritonavir regimen. It also did not shorten time to clinical recovery and length of hospital stay.

TI  - Emerging treatment strategies for COVID-19 infection
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - The new type of coronavirus (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2 originated from Wuhan, China and has led to a worldwide pandemic. COVID-19 is a novel emerging infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 characterized as atypical pneumonia. As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The typical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, sore throat, fatigue, cough, and dyspnoea combined with recent exposure. Most of the patients with COVID-19 have mild or moderate disease, however up to 5-10% present with severe and even life-threatening disease course. The mortality rates are approximately 2%. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective and specific antiviral treatment. Currently, supportive care measures such as ventilation oxygenation and fluid management remain the standard of care. Several clinical trials are currently trying to identify the most potent drug or combination against the disease, and it is strongly recommended to enroll patients into ongoing trials. Antivirals can be proven as safe and effective only in the context of randomized clinical trials. Currently several agents such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, monoclonal antibodies, antisense RNA, corticosteroids, convalescent plasma and vaccines are being evaluated. The large numbers of therapeutic interventions aim to define the most efficacious regimen. The aim of this article is to describe the treatment strategies that have been used for COVID-19 patients and review all the available literature.

TI  - Simultaneous occurrence of knee septic arthritis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A case report
T2  - EGYPTIAN RHEUMATOLOGIST
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is increasingly recognized as a serious, worldwide public health concern. Most of the patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms. It is important to identify the unusual manifestations and their long-term complication. Case presentation: A case of COVID-19 in 45 years old man with septic arthritis due to Staphylococcus aureus is presented. COVID-19 was diagnosed using real-time polymerase chain reaction without obvious clinical manifestation. The patient had no history of trauma or inflammatory arthritis and had progressive left knee pain and limitation of movement. Knee X-ray was normal. Aspiration of the knee joint fluid showed a cloudy and purulent appearance. The patient was admitted to hospital and immediately treated with vancomycin 1gr/12 hr. A polymerized chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19 was performed, which was positive 24 h after hospitalization. Staphylococcus aureus was reported in synovial fluid culture which was sensitive to vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, thus vancomycin was continued. On the 4th day of hospitalization the patient had cough, therefore underwent CT scan lungs and ground-glass opacities (GGO) characteristic of COVID-19 were noticed. Favipiravir and interferon were started. Patient's knee aspiration was performed for 5 consecutive days. On the 6th day of hospitalization, joint fluid markedly decreased and the patient's oxygen saturation was 96%. One week after hospitalization, the patient was discharged and a month later knee examination was completely normal. Conclusions: Septic arthritis should be considered in the manifestations or co-morbidity of COVID-19 patients with joint pain, swelling or redness. (c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

TI  - Potential of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) viscera bioactive peptides as antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID 19)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FISHERIES AND MARINE
CP  - 1st International Conference on Fisheries and Marine (ICFM)
AB  - Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a severe problem in the world today. The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains protease and glycoprotein spike, which was used infection and development. The RBD (Receptor Binding Domain) of the glycoprotein Spike (RBD-S) can bind to the ACE2 receptor (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2) on the Domain protease (PD) (PD-ACE2) of the host cell causing virus infection. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of bioactive peptides from tilapia viscera hydrolysate as an antiviral peptide to attempt a simulated docking with four protein target virus COVID 19. The research was conducted by molecular docking using the PyRx software. Selected protein targets were SARS-CoV-2 protease (GDP ID: 6LU7), SPIKE COVID 19 (PDB ID: 6LVN), ACE2 (GDP ID: 6VW1), and deubiquitinase inhibitors block the SARS virus replication (PDB ID: 3E9S). The formed binding affinity was represented as a docking score. The results showed that both the Asp-Trp and Val-Tyr peptides were potential as SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, with an affinity strength equal to chloroquine and favipiravir. The Asp-Trp and Val-Tyr peptides could bind to all four receptor proteins target on the active side. Therefore, it potentially inhibits the virus sticking to proteins target that results in inhibition of virus replication. Generally, the Asp-Trp and ValTyr peptides of tilapia viscera hydrolysate are potential as an alternative antiviral peptide to medicate the infections and replication of COVID-19.

TI  - Efficacy of Early Treatment With Favipiravir on Disease Progression Among High-Risk Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Randomized, Open-Label Clinical Trial
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background The role of favipiravir in preventing disease progression in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains uncertain. We aimed to determine its effect in preventing disease progression from nonhypoxia to hypoxia among high-risk COVID-19 patients. Methods This was an open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted at 14 public hospitals across Malaysia (February-July 2021) among 500 symptomatic, RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, aged >= 50 years with >= 1 comorbidity, and hospitalized within first 7 days of illness. Patients were randomized 1:1 to favipiravir plus standard care or standard care alone. Favipiravir was administered at 1800 mg 2x/day on day 1 followed by 800 mg 2x/day until day 5. The primary endpoint was rate of clinical progression from nonhypoxia to hypoxia. Secondary outcomes included rates of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in-hospital mortality. Results Of 500 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 62.5 [8.0] years; 258 women [51.6%]; 251 [50.2%] had COVID-19 pneumonia), 487 (97.4%) patients completed the trial. Clinical progression to hypoxia occurred in 46 (18.4%) patients on favipiravir plus standard care and 37 (14.8%) on standard care alone (OR, 1.30; 95% CI: .81-2.09; P = .28). All 3 prespecified secondary endpoints were similar between both groups. Mechanical ventilation occurred in 6 (2.4%) vs 5 (2.0%) (OR, 1.20; 95% CI: .36-4.23; P = .76), ICU admission in 13 (5.2%) vs 12 (4.8%) (OR, 1.09; 95% CI: .48-2.47; P = .84), and in-hospital mortality in 5 (2.0%) vs 0 (OR, 12.54; 95% CI: .76-207.84; P = .08) patients. Conclusions Among COVID-19 patients at high risk of disease progression, early treatment with oral favipiravir did not prevent their disease progression from nonhypoxia to hypoxia.
   Favipiravir's role remains uncertain in COVID-19. Early treatment with 5 days' oral favipiravir did not prevent disease progression from nonhypoxia to hypoxia in high-risk patients. No beneficial effects were observed in preventing mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and in-hospital mortality.

TI  - Drug-Induced Liver Injury in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: The severity of COVID-19 may be correlated with the risk of liver injury development. An increasing number of studies indicate that degrees of hepatotoxicity has been associated with using some medications in the management of COVID-19 patients. However, limited studies had systematically investigated the evidence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in COVID-19 patients. Thus, this study aimed to examine DILI in COVID-19 patients.
   Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to December 30, 2020. Search items included "SARS-CoV-2", "Coronavirus," COVID-19, and liver injury.
   Results: We included 22 related articles. Among included studies, there was five case report, five case series, four randomizes control trial (RCT), seven cohort studies, and one cross-sectional study. The drugs included in this systematic review were remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Among included studies, some studies revealed a direct role of drugs, while others couldn't certainly confirm that the liver injury was due to SARS-CoV-2 itself or administration of medications. However, a significant number of studies reported that liver injury could be attributable to drug administration.
   Discussion: Liver injury in COVID-19 patients could be caused by the virus itself or the administration of some types of drug. Intensive liver function monitoring should be considered for patients, especially patients who are treated with drugs such as remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tocilizumab.

TI  - Clinical Course and Outcomes among COVID-19 Patients at the Hospitel in Bangkok: A Retrospective Study
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - A hospitel is a hotel that has been designated as an extension of the healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic in resource-limited settings. However, the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 admitted to this unique type of facility have never been studied. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of adult patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to a single hospitel in Bangkok, Thailand. Risk factors with respect to chest X-ray progression and clinical progression were analyzed using a logistic regression. A total of 514 patients were recruited, with a mean (standard deviation) age of 35.6 (13.4) years, and 58.6% were women. Patients were admitted after a median (interquartile range) of 3 (2-6) days of illness and were classified with mild (12.3%), moderate (86.6%), and severe (1.1%) conditions. Favipiravir and corticosteroids were prescribed in 26.3% and 14.9% of patients, respectively. Chest X-ray progression was found in 7.6% of patients, and hospital transfer occurred in 2.9%, with no deaths. Favipiravir use (odds ratio (OR) 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-7.5, p = 0.005), nausea/vomiting after admission (OR 32.3, 95% CI 1.5-700.8, p = 0.03), and higher oxygen saturation on admission (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.22-3.23, p = 0.005) were factors associated with chest X-ray progression. Additionally, an oxygen requirement on admission was an independent risk factor for hospital transfer (OR 904, 95% CI 113-7242, p < 0.001). In a setting where the hospitel has been proposed as an extension facility for patients with relatively non-severe COVID-19, most patients could achieve a favorable clinical outcome. However, patients who require oxygen supplementation should be closely monitored for disease progression and promptly transferred to a hospital if necessary.

AB  - A 55-year-old man who underwent bicaval orthotopic heart transplantation nine months earlier presented with complaints of diarrhea and oliguria. Laboratory findings showed pancytopenia and an elevated creatinine level. Cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil were discontinued, and the patient received only everolimus. As he was immunosuppressed and had atypical symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing was performed, which yielded a positive result. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir were initiated. Although the patient suffered from acute renal failure, his condition showed an improvement after hydration plus a five-day antiviral treatment and, then, treatment was stopped. His COVID-19 test was negative after 10 days of follow-up and treatment, and he was discharged with cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil.

T2  - SAGE OPEN MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in the newborn is a difficult-to-treat condition. Early clinical signs of pneumonia are nonspecific and present as respiratory distress of varying severity, and tachypnea is a predominant clinical sign. A 47-day-old, asymptomatic male newborn of coronavirus disease 2019 infected mother tested positive for corona virus disease 2019 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. During hospitalization, he developed progressive tachypnea, tachycardia, and chest radiography abnormalities, and was diagnosed as coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. He was treated with favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir. A favipiravir-based regimen maybe the drug of choice for coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in the newborn.

TI  - Drug-Membrane Interactions: Effects of Virus-Specific RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Inhibitors Remdesivir and Favipiravir on the Structure of Lipid Bilayers
T2  - BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The two RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors remdesivir and favipiravir were originally developed and approved as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for the treatment of harmful viral infections such as Ebola and influenza. With the outbreak of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the two drugs were repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Clinical studies suggested that the efficacy of the drugs is enhanced in the case of an early or even prophylactic application. Because the contact between drug molecules and the plasma membrane is essential for a successful permeation process of the substances and therefore for their intracellular efficiency, drug-induced effects on the membrane structure are likely and have already been shown for other substances. We investigated the impact of remdesivir and favipiravir on lipid bilayers in model and cell membranes via several biophysical approaches. The measurements revealed that the embedding of remdesivir molecules in the lipid bilayer results in a disturbance of the membrane structure of the tested phospholipid vesicles. Nevertheless, in a cell-based assay, the presence of remdesivir induced only weak hemolysis of the treated erythrocytes. In contrast, no experimental indication for an effect on the structure and integrity of the membrane was detected in the case of favipiravir. Regarding potential prophylactic or accompanying use of the drugs in the therapy of COVID-19, the physiologically relevant impacts associated with the drug-induced structural modifications of the membrane might be important to understand side effects and/or low effectivities.

TI  - Treatment strategies to fight the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: A challenge for a Rubik's Cube solver
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE
AB  - SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the new lung disease COVID-19 is closely related to SARS-CoV, and together with MERS-CoV are three new human coronaviruses that emerged in the last 20 years. The COVID-19 outbreak is a rapidly evolving situation with higher transmissibility and infectivity compared with SARS and MERS. Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe illness. The prevalent cause of mortality is pneumonia that progresses to ARDS. The ongoing pandemic has already resulted in more than 135,000 deaths and an unprecedented burden on national health systems worldwide. Pending the availability of a vaccine, there is a critical need to identify effective treatments and a number of clinical trials have been implemented worldwide. Trials are based on repurposed drugs that are already approved for other infections, have acceptable safety profiles or have performed well in animal studies against the other two deadly coronaviruses. Supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy at present, as it is still unclear how well these data can be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2. Most of those emerging re-introduced drugs are administered to patients in the context of clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the strategies currently employed in the treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Two Green Micellar HPLC and Mathematically Assisted UV Spectroscopic Methods for the Simultaneous Determination of Molnupiravir and Favipiravir as a Novel Combined COVID-19 Antiviral Regimen
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - Following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, a race was initiated to find a successful regimen for postinfections. Among those trials, a recent study declared the efficacy of an antiviral combination of favipiravir (FAV) and molnupiravir (MLP). The combined regimen helped in a successful 60% eradication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the lungs of studied hamster models. Moreover, it prevented viral transmission to cohosted sentinels. Because both medications are orally bioavailable, the coformulation of FAV and MLP can be predicted. The developed study is aimed at developing new green and simple methods for the simultaneous determination of FAV and MLP and then at their application in the study of their dissolution behavior if coformulated together. A green micellar HPLC method was validated using an RP-C18 core-shell column (5 mu m, 150 x 4.6 mm) and an isocratic mixed micellar mobile phase composed of 0.1 M SDS, 0.01 M Brij-35, and 0.02 M monobasic potassium phosphate mixture and adjusted to pH 3.1 at 1.0 mL min(-1) flow rate. The analytes were detected at 230 nm. The run time was less than five minutes under the optimized chromatographic conditions. Four other multivariate chemometric model methods were developed and validated, namely, classical least square (CLS), principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS-1), and genetic algorithm-partial least squares (GA-PLS-1). The developed models succeeded in resolving the great similarity and overlapping in the FAV and MLP UV spectra unlike the traditional univariate methods. All methods were organic solvent-free, did not require extraction or derivatization steps, and were applied for the construction of the simultaneous dissolution profile for FAV tablets and MLP capsules. The methods revealed that the amount of the simultaneously released cited drugs increases up until reaching a plateau after 15 and 20 min for FAV and MLP, respectively. The greenness was assessed on GAPI and found to be in harmony with green analytical chemistry concepts.

TI  - Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Cytokine Storms for More Effective Treatments from an Inflammatory Pathophysiology
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - The Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept the world and caused a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 seems to have originated from bats as their reservoir hosts over time. Similar to SARS-CoV, this new virus also exerts its action on the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This action causes infections in cells and establishes an infectious disease, COVID-19. Against this viral invasion, the human body starts to activate the innate immune system in producing and releasing proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and other chemokines, such as G-CSF, IP10 and MCPl, which all develop and increase the inflammatory response. In cases of COVID-19, excessive inflammatory responses occur, and exaggerated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are detected in the serum, resulting in cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm. This causes coagulation abnormalities, excessive oxidation developments, mitochondrial permeability transition, vital organ damage, immune system failure and eventually progresses to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure. Additionally, the excessive inflammatory responses also cause mitochondrial dysfunction due to progressive and persistent stress. This damages cells and mitochondria, leaving products containing mitochondrial DNA and cell debris involved in the excessive chronic inflammation as damage-associated molecular patterns. Thus, the respiratory infection progressively leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation from acute respiratory distress syndrome, including vascular endothelial cell damage and coagulation-fibrinolysis system disorders. This condition causes central nervous system disorders, renal failure, liver failure and, finally, multiple organ failure. Regarding treatment for COVID-19, the following are progressive and multiple steps for mitigating the excessive inflammatory response and subsequent cytokine storm in patients. First, administering of favipiravir to suppress SARS-CoV-2 and nafamostat to inhibit ACE2 function should be considered. Second, anti-rheumatic drugs (monoclonal antibodies), which act on the leading cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6) and/or cytokine receptors such as tocilizumab, should be administered as well. Finally, melatonin may also have supportive effects for cytokine release syndrome, resulting in mitochondrial function improvement. This paper will further explore these subjects with reports mostly from China and Europe.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The global pandemic COVID-19, caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as severe public health issue crippling world health care systems. Substantial knowledge has been generated about the pathophysiology of the disease and possible treatment modalities in a relatively short span of time. As of August 19, 2020, there is no approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19. More than 600 clinical trials for potential therapeutics are underway and the results are expected soon. Based on early experience, different treatment such as anti-viral drugs (remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir), corticostemids (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone) or convalescent plasma therapy are recommended in addition to supportive care and symptomatic therapy. There are several treatments currently being investigated to address the pathological conditions associated with COVID-19. This review provides currently available information and insight into pathophysiology of the disease, potential targets, and relevant clinical trials for COVID-19.

TI  - Tocilizumab combined with favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19: A multicenter trial in a small sample size
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Background: Since December 2019, COVID-19 has spread to almost every corner of the world. In theory, tocilizumab and favipiravir are considered to be reliable drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 with elevated IL-6. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab combined with favipiravir in patients with COVID-19.
   Methods: This was a multicenter trial in adults with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned (3:1:1) to a 14 day combination of favipiravir combined with tocilizumab (combination group), favipiravir, and tocilizumab. The primary outcome was the cumulative lung lesion remission rate (lung CT examination indicated absorption of lung inflammation).
   Results: Between Feb 2 and March 15, 2020, 26 patients were recruited; 14 were randomly assigned to the combination group, 7 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 5 were assigned to the tocilizumab group. The cumulative lung lesion remission rate at day 14 was significantly higher in combination group as compared with favipiravir group (P = 0.019, HR 2.66 95 % CI [1.08-6.53]). And there was also a significant difference between tocilizumab and favipivavir (P = 0.034, HR 3.16, 95 % CI 0.62-16.10). In addition, there was no significant difference between the combination group and the tocilizumab group (P = 0.575, HR 1.28 95 %CI 0.39-4.23). Furthermore, combined therapy can also significantly relieve clinical symptoms and help blood routine to return to normal. No serious adverse events were reported.
   Conclusion: Tocilizumab combined with or without favipiravir can effectively improve the pulmonary inflammation of COVID-19 patients and inhibit the deterioration of the disease.

TI  - Lifesaving combined treatment in a rapidly progressive COVID-19 pneumonia case with extensive lung involvement
T2  - BIOMEDICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB  - COVID-19 pneumonia has rapid development into a global pandemic. For the infected patients, it is an urgent matter to improve the cure rate and reduce the death rate, but there are no effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 so far. There is an urgent need for effective treatment. The current focus has been on the development of novel therapeutics, including antivirals and vaccines. One of these drugs, Favipiravir (Avigan), an antiviral agent approved for use in influenza in Japan, is being studied for the treatment of COVID-19. Herein, we report a patient; a 53 Y/O man without any underlying disease, developed COVID19 pneumonia rapidly and well respond to combination treatment including Dexamethasone, Favipiravir, and IFN-beta -1a.

TI  - Evaluation of the Effects of Favipiravir Combined with Vitamin C on Alveolar Bone in Rats
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Favipiravir and Vitamin C (Vit C) were used together in the treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effects of favipiravir on the periodontium are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Favipiravir and Vit C treatment on alveolar bone metabolism. Experimental: Fifty healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (2-3 months old) were randomly divided into five equal groups (n = 10): Control, Favi 20, Favi 100, Favi 20+Vit C, Favi 100+Vit C. Favipiravir (20 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, i.m.) and Vit C (150 mg/kg/day, oral) were administered to the rats for 14 days. Alveolar bone loss (ABL) and histopathological changes were examined using a light microscope. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), caspase-3, bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the bone tissues. Results: Favipiravir increased the levels of RANKL and caspase-3 expression but decreased BMP-2 and ALP levels in a dose-dependent manner. Favi 20+Vit C and Favi 100 +Vit C groups showed decreased RANKL and caspase-3 levels in addition to increased BMP-2 and ALP levels. Conclusion: Favipiravir can cause histopathological damage to the periodontium, but administration of favipiravir combined with Vit C can provide a protective effect against this damage.

TI  - COVID-19 challenges and its therapeutics
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - COVID-19, an infectious disease, has emerged as one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making it one of the severe public health issues in recent decades. nCoV, the novel SARS coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has brought together scientists in the quest for possible therapeutic and preventive measures. The development of new drugs to manage COVID-19 effectively is a challenging and time-consuming process, thus encouraging extensive investigation of drug repurposing and repositioning candidates. Several medications, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, favipiravir, ribavirin, ritonavir, interferons, azithromycin, capivasertib and bevacizumab, are currently under clinical trials for COVID-19. In addition, several medicinal plants with considerable antiviral activities are potential therapeutic candidates for COVID-19. Statistical data show that the pandemic is yet to slow down, and authorities are placing their hopes on vaccines. Within a short period, four types of vaccines, namely, whole virus, viral vector, protein subunit, and nucleic acid (RNA/DNA), which can confer protection against COVID-19 in different ways, were already in a clinical trial. SARS-CoV-2 variants spread is associated with antibody escape from the virus Spike epitopes, which has grave concerns for viral re-infection and even compromises the effectiveness of the vaccines. Despite these efforts, COVID-19 treatment is still solely based on clinical management through supportive care. We aim to highlight the recent trends in COVID-19, relevant statistics, and clinical findings, as well as potential therapeutics, including in-line treatment methods, preventive measures, and vaccines to combat the prevalence of COVID-19.

TI  - Efficacy of antiviral therapies for COVID-19: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to pose a significant threat to public health worldwide. The purpose of this study was to review current evidence obtained from randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of antivirals for COVID-19 treatment. Methods A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed to identify randomized controlled trials published up to September 4, 2021 that examined the efficacy of antivirals for COVID-19 treatment. Studies that were not randomized controlled trials or that did not include treatment of COVID-19 with approved antivirals were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) method. Due to study heterogeneity, inferential statistics were not performed and data were expressed as descriptive statistics. Results Of the 2,284 articles retrieved, 31 (12,440 patients) articles were included. Overall, antivirals were more effective when administered early in the disease course. No antiviral treatment demonstrated efficacy at reducing COVID-19 mortality. Sofosbuvir/daclatasvir results suggested clinical improvement, although statistical power was low. Remdesivir exhibited efficacy in reducing time to recovery, but results were inconsistent across trials. Conclusions Although select antivirals have exhibited efficacy to improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, none demonstrated efficacy in reducing mortality. Larger RCTs are needed to conclusively establish efficacy.

TI  - Potential repurposed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection drugs
T2  - RSC ADVANCES
AB  - The global outbreak of COVID-19 viral infection is associated with the absence of specific drug(s) for fighting this viral infection. About 10 million people are already infected, about 500 000 deaths all over the world to date. Great efforts have been made to find solutions for this viral infection, either vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, or small molecule drugs; this can stop the spread of infection to avoid the expected human, economic and social catastrophe associated with this infection. In the literature and during clinical trials in hospitals, several FDA approved drugs for different diseases have the potential to treat or reduce the severity of COVID-19. Repurposing of these drugs as potential agents to treat COVID-19 reduces the time and cost to find effective COVID-19 agents. This review article summarizes the present situation of transmission, pathogenesis and statistics of COVID-19 in the world. Moreover, it includes chemistry, mechanism of action at the molecular level of the possible drug molecules which are liable for redirection as potential COVID-19 therapeutic agents. This includes polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, malaria drugs, lipid lowering statins, rheumatoid arthritis drugs and some miscellaneous agents. We offer research data and knowledge about the chemistry and biology of potential COVID-19 drugs for the research community in this field.

TI  - Critical review and analysis of approval of favipiravir for restricted emergency use in mild-to-moderate COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY & PHARMACOTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, the Indian drug regulatory agency, granted accelerated approval to Glenmark Pharmaceuticals to market favipiravir in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 on June 19, 2020, for restricted use. The patients should sign informed consent before receiving favipiravir. Subsequently, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals issued a press release on June 20, 2020, stating that it was a landmark development for COVID-19 patients in India and the approval was backed by strong clinical evidence supporting the use of favipiravir in COVID-19. The authors carefully reviewed the press release issued by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, product information, and informed consent form available with FabiFlu (R) (Glenmark's favipiravir brand) and public notice issued by the Drugs Controller General of India. They have gone through the regulatory requirements of emergency approvals in India and the USA, WHO's clinical trial synopsis for assessing efficacy of anti-COVID drugs and emergency use authorization granted to remdesivir in the USA. They critically analyzed the efficacy data presented in favor of favipiravir in this due process. Based on the review and analysis, the authors consider that the two crucial publications quoted in the product information, Chen et al. (2020) and Cai et al. (2020), do not provide convincing evidence for the efficacy of favipiravir. The entire clinical data presented in the press release and product information do not offer undisputed support for the efficacy of favipiravir in mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Moreover, it is the right time to take policy decision and frame guidelines on how to handle emergency approvals for medicinal products in grave situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in India.

TI  - Pharmacological management of COVID-19 in pregnancy
T2  - ADVANCES IN HUMAN BIOLOGY
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a severe and rapid spread disease is a global health emergency since December 2019. During the outbreak of COVID-19, infected pregnant women were treated with different pharmacological regimens; however, trial studies are still investigating their safety and effectiveness. In the present study, we reviewed all recently published studies related to the pharmaceutical management of COVID-19 in pregnancy to discuss the rapid evolving pattern of administered medications. A review study was conducted to investigate the pharmacological management of COVID-19 in pregnancy. All types of full English and recent articles through detailed research on Cochrane Library, PubMed, UpToDate, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases were collected. Several medical sites were also investigated. The implemented keywords for the search were COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, pregnancy, management, treatment, medication, drug, antiviral, teratogenicity, possible effect, therapeutic effect, adverse effect and pregnancy outcome. There are no definitely specific approved pharmacological treatments for COVID-19 in pregnancy. Evaluating published literature showed that different treatment options, including chloroquine, favipiravir and ribavirin, convalescent plasma, interferons and remdesivir, have been used to stop or decline viral replication. We reviewed published evidence for drug selection and its safety during pregnancy, but conflicting results associated with numbers of trials show that we need further investigation for newer antiviral drugs for use in pregnancy. It seems that management of COVID-19 needs a multidisciplinary approach, and a consultant medical team should be arranged to decide about medications for the management of COVID-19-infected pregnant women.

TI  - Methylprednisolone pulse therapy for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019: A single-center retrospective observational study
T2  - ACUTE MEDICINE & SURGERY
AB  - Aim: This study compared the clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia treated with high-dose methylprednisolone and other steroids.
   Methods: This retrospective observational study included critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia adult patients with tracheal intubation treated between April 1, 2020, and September 15, 2021. Of the 46 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 36 received steroid pulse therapy (Group P) and 10 received steroids without pulse therapy (Group NP). Subgroup analyses in Group P by methylprednisolone dose of 1000 or 500 mg for 3 days during intensive care unit stay were carried out. The primary and secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality and steroid-associated complications, respectively.
   Results: In the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis, there was no difference in the 28-day survival between P and NP groups (log-rank P = 0.046). Univariate Cox proportional hazard model also showed that Group P had a decreased 28-day mortality (hazard ratio 0.30; [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.44]; P < 0.01). After adjusting for covariates (age, sex, remdesivir, baricitinib, and favipiravir), using the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, Group P had improved 28-day mortality (0.50 [0.30-0.85], P = 0.01).
   Conclusion: Steroid pulse therapy might improve the 28-day and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI  - Case study: An older COVID-19 patient in a Turkish intensive care unit with prolonged stay
T2  - NURSING IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - This paper reports the presentation and management of an older female patient who was diagnosed with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and discharged from an intensive care unit (ICU) after prolonged hospitalization. The patient's COVID-19 test was negative; therefore, she was monitored in the COVID-19 general clinic with normal levels of oxygen saturation (SpO(2)). The patient had been taking Plaquenil for rheumatoid arthritis for a long time. Azithromycin was administered first, and then, the treatment continued with favipiravir according to the national treatment protocol in Turkey. On the third day in the COVID-19 general clinic, she was transferred to the ICU because of decreased saturation levels. Owing to worsening respiratory status and SpO(2) <70%, the patient was intubated on the sixth day in the ICU, and every day, she was nursed in a prone position for >16 hours. We believe that the treatment and care activities under qualified and effective nursing care, such as providing appropriate respiratory support at the right time, early initiation and maintenance of anticoagulant therapy, long-term prone positioning, maintaining sufficient fluid resuscitation, and early commencement of balanced enteral nutrition, contributed to the successful discharge of the patient from the ICU. The patient was finally extubated on the 23rd day. Respiratory support was continued with oxygen administered at 2 lt/min through a nasal canula with SpO(2) at 94%. We believe that by combining all these factors, the patient's results improved. She was discharged from the ICU after 25 days without any organ dysfunction. During the 25 days of care in the ICU, infectious disease protection and isolation rules were strictly adhered to, and personal protective equipment was worn.

TI  - Predicting In Vitro and In Vivo Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activities of Antivirals by Intracellular Bioavailability and Biochemical Activity
T2  - ACS OMEGA
AB  - Cellular drug response (concentration required for obtaining 50% of a maximum cellular effect, EC50) can be predicted by the intracellular bioavailability (Fic) and biochemical activity (half-maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50) of drugs. In an ideal model, the cellular negative log of EC50 (pEC50) equals the sum of log Fic and the negative log of IC50 (pIC50). Here, we measured Fic's of remdesivir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine in various cells and calculated their anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50's. The predicted EC50's are close to the observed EC50's in vitro. When the lung concentrations of antiviral drugs are higher than the predicted EC50's in alveolar type 2 cells, the antiviral drugs inhibit virus replication in vivo, and vice versa. Overall, our results indicate that both in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities of drugs can be predicted by their intracellular bioavailability and biochemical activity without using virus. This virus-free strategy can help medicinal chemists and pharmacologists to screen antivirals during early drug discovery, especially for researchers who are not able to work in the high-level biosafety lab.

TI  - Risk factors for prolonged nucleic acid conversion time in patients with COVID-19
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SCIENCES-IJHS
AB  - Objectives: The time for PCR positivity to negativity is defined as nucleic acid conversion time (NCT) and is very important in terminating the isolation of patients and determining infectiousness in patients with COVID-19. The aim of this study is to determine the median NCT and to evaluate the clinical and laboratory parameters affecting it in patients with COVID-19.
   Methods: This study included 318 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 diagnosed with PCR positivity retrospectively.
   Results: The median NCT was 11 days. Patients were divided into 2 groups as early (<11 days) and late conversion (>= 11 days). Older age, sore throat, onset fever, fever 72 h after hospitalization, history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus without a mask, and moderated disease were significantly more common in the late conversion group. In addition, favipiravir use was higher in early conversion group and hydrox ychloroquine use was higher in late conversion group. In multivariate analysis, sore throat (OR = 2.570; 95% CI: 1.051-6.284, P = 0.039) and hydroxychloroquine use (OR = 3.518, 95% CI: 1.163-10.635. P = 0.026) were independent risk factors for late conversion. Favipiravir use (OR = 0.062, 95% CI: 0.021-0.184, P = 0.0001) negatively affected the late conversion.
   Conclusion: NCT was longer in patients with COVID-19 who had sore throat at admission and were treated with hydroxychloroquine instead of favipiravir.

TI  - Current Status of Multiple Drug Molecules, and Vaccines: An Update in SARS-CoV-2 Therapeutics
T2  - MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease that has taken the lives of many around the world. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). To date, the USA, Italy, Spain, France, Russia, and the UK have been hit the hardest by the virus. However, death counts are still rising. Some nations have managed to "flatten" the death rate via protective measures such physical distancing, quarantine measures, and therapeutic management. The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus comprises of S proteins, M proteins, E proteins, hemagglutinin esterases, nucleocapsid proteins, and a 30-kb RNA genome. Viral proteases cleave these polyproteins and RNA-dependent polymerases replicate the genome. Currently, there are no effective therapies against this new disease. Numerous investigators are developing novel protease inhibitors, some of which have made it into clinical trials. Researchers are also attempting to develop a vaccine. In this review paper, we discuss the latest therapeutic developments against COVID-19.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and pandemic that began near the end of 2019 has posed a challenge to global health. At present, many candidate small-molecule therapeutics have been developed that can inhibit both the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and even potentially relieve cytokine storms and other related complications. Meanwhile, host-targeted drugs that inhibit cellular transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) can prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering cells, and its combination with chloroquine and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors can limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. The present article provides an overview of these small-molecule therapeutics based on insights from medicinal chemistry research and focuses on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors, such as the nucleoside analogues remdesivir, favipiravir and ribavirin. This review also covers inhibitors of 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)), papain-like protease (PLpro) and other potentially innovative active ingredient molecules, describing their potential targets, activities, clinical status and side effects.

TI  - Computational drug re-purposing targeting the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 as an effective strategy to neutralize COVID-19
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - COVID-19 has intensified into a global pandemic with over a million deaths worldwide. Experimental research analyses have been implemented and executed with the sole rationale to counteract SARS-CoV-2, which has initiated potent therapeutic strategy development in coherence with computational biology validation focusing on the characterized viral drug targets signified by proteomic and genomic data. Spike glycoprotein is one of such potential drug target that promotes viral attachment to the host cellular membrane by binding to its receptor ACE-2 via its Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD). Multiple Sequence alignment and relative phylogenetic analysis revealed significant sequential disparities of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to previously encountered SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV strains. We implemented a drug re-purposing approach wherein the inhibitory efficacy of a cluster of thirty known drug candidates comprising of antivirals, antibiotics and phytochemicals (selection contingent on their present developmental status in underway clinical trials) was elucidated by subjecting them to molecular docking analyses against the spike protein RBD model (developed using homology modelling and validated using SAVES server 5.0) and the composite trimeric structures of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicated that Camostat, Favipiravir, Tenofovir, Raltegravir and Stavudine showed significant interactions with spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Proficient bioavailability coupled with no predicted in silico toxicity rendered them as prospective alternatives for designing and development of novel combinatorial therapy formulations for improving existing treatment regimes to combat COVID-19.

TI  - Incidence and risk factors of adverse drug reactions in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: A pharmacovigilance experience utilizing an ADR trigger tool
T2  - SAUDI PHARMACEUTICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Since the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic, most countries started treating their patients with various therapies. However, the data regarding their safety and effectiveness is still lacking.Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) incidence and their predisposing factors among COVID-19 patients.Methods: A retrospective observational study that was conducted at a tertiary academic hospital from March - June 2020. Patients were included if they were > 18 years old, inpatient, had a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for COVID-19, and were treated with; (lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, favipiravir, ribavirin, or interferon-ss) either as monotherapy or combination therapy for three days or longer. The data of eligible patients were retrieved from the electronic medical records. A standardized data collection form was designed to collect patient demographics, COVID-19 severity based on the Saudi Ministry of Health management protocols, antiviral therapies, duration of therapy, and length of stay (LOS). The ADRs were identified via conducting a comprehensive review using predefined triggers and were evaluated using Naranjo Score.Results: A total of 155 patients were included of which 123 (79.4%) were males. In our sample, the incidence proportion of ADRs per patient was 72.3%. A total of 287 ADRs were identified most of them were hepatic (n = 101, 35.2%), gastrointestinal (n = 59, 20.6%), hematological (n = 47, 16%), and endocrine (n = 45, 15%). Hydroxychloroquine was the most common drug associated with ADRs (n = 155). The length of stay (10 - 20 days) was the only statistically significant with the ADR incidence (p-value = 0.008; 95 %CI 1.216:3.568).Conclusions: The ADRs are prevalent among COVID-19 patients, which assure the importance of implementing active hospital-based pharmacovigilance systems.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Comparison of clinically approved molecules on SARS-CoV-2 drug target proteins: a molecular docking study
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB  - The new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than 22.6 million people worldwide. Since the first day the virus was spotted in Wuhan, China, numerous drug design studies have been conducted all over the globe. Most of these studies target the receptor-binding domain of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is known to bind to the human ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 main protease, vital for the virus' replication. However, there might be a third target, human furin protease, which cleaves the virus' S1-S2 domains playing an active role in its entry into the host cell. In this study, we docked five clinically used drug molecules, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, and ritonavir onto three target proteins, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and human furin protease. Results of molecular docking simulations revealed that human furin protease might be targeted by COVID-19. Remdesivir, a nucleic acid derivative, strongly bound to the active site of this protease, suggesting that this molecule can be used as a template for designing novel furin protease inhibitors to fight against the disease. Proteindrug interactions revealed in this study at the molecular level, can pave the way for better drug design for each specific target.

TI  - Japanese rapid/living recommendations on drug management for COVID-19: updated guidelines (September 2021)
T2  - ACUTE MEDICINE & SURGERY
AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide since early 2020, and there are still no signs of resolution. The Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock (J-SSCG) 2020 Special Committee created the Japanese rapid/living recommendations on drug management for COVID-19 using the experience of creating the J-SSCG.
   Methods: The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to determine the certainty of the evidence and strength of the recommendations. The first edition of this guideline was released on September 9, 2020, and this document is the revised edition (version 4.0; released on September 9, 2021). Clinical questions (CQs) were set for the following seven drugs: favipiravir (CQ1), remdesivir (CQ2), corticosteroids (CQ4), tocilizumab (CQ5), anticoagulants (CQ7), baricitinib (CQ8), and casirivimab/imdevimab (CQ9). Two CQs (hydroxychloroquine [CQ3] and ciclesonide [CQ6]) were retrieved in this updated version.
   Recommendations: Favipiravir is not suggested for all patients with COVID-19 (GRADE 2C). Remdesivir is suggested for patients with moderate COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2B). Corticosteroids are recommended for patients with moderate COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 1B) and for patients with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation/intensive care (GRADE 1A); however, their administration is not recommended for patients with mild COVID-19 not requiring supplemental oxygen (GRADE 1B). Tocilizumab is suggested for patients with moderate COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2B). Anticoagulant administration is recommended for patients with moderate COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization and patients with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation/intensive care (good practice statement). Baricitinib is suggested for patients with moderate COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2C). Casirivimab/imdevimab is recommended for patients with mild COVID-19 not requiring supplemental oxygen (GRADE 1B). We hope that these updated clinical practice guidelines will help medical professionals involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Favipiravir versus standard of care in patients with severe COVID-19 infections: A retrospective comparative study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objective: To assess the efficacy of Favipiravir compared to the standard therapy in treating patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were treated with favipiravir, versus comparison group that received the standard of care. Results: A total of 226 patients were included; 110 patients received favipiravir and 116 patients received standard of care. Patients who received favipiravir had longer time to recovery (14.2 +/- 8.8 versus 12.8 +/- 5.2, p = 0.17). Favipiravir was associated with an improved early day 14 mortality (4 [3.6%] versus 11 [9.5%]), p = 0.008), but was associated with a higher day 28 mortality (26 [23.6%] versus 11 [9.5%], p = 0.02). The overall mortality was higher in the favipiravir versus the standard of care group but difference was not statistically significant (33 [30.0%] versus 24 [20.7%], p = 0.10). Conclusion: The addition of favipiravir to standard of care was not associated with any improvement in clinical outcomes or mortality. Larger randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to further assess the efficacy of favipiravir. (c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Evaluation of the toxicological effects of favipiravir (T-705) on liver and kidney in rats: biochemical and histopathological approach
T2  - DRUG AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Favipiravir is a selective RNA polymerase inhibitor and a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, an important agent used in viral infections, including Ebola, Lassa, and COVID-19. This study aims to evaluate the potential toxicological effects of favipiravir administration on rats' liver and kidney tissues. Favipiravir was applied for five and ten days in the present study. During this period, it was aimed to determine possible toxic effects on the liver and kidney. For this purpose, the impact of favipiravir on liver and kidney tissues were examined using histopathologic and biochemical methods. The present study showed that favipiravir administration led to an elevation in the liver and kidney serum enzymes and oxidative and histopathologic damages. Favipiravir administration caused apoptotic cell death (Caspase-3 and Bcl-2), inflammation (NF-kappa B and IL-6), and a decrease in renal reabsorption (AQP2) levels. In the evaluation of the findings obtained in this study, it was determined that the favipiravir or metabolites caused liver and kidney damages.

TI  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Children: Prevalence, Diagnosis, Clinical Symptoms, and Treatment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE
AB  - In this article, we have reviewed the prevalence, diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment of COVID-19 in children. The incidence of COVID-19 among children under 18 years was 2.1% based on the reported studies, where the mortality rate in the same age group was 0.2%. No death has been reported in children under 9-years old. There are some articles that report children with COVID-19 having symptoms similar to Kawasaki's disease. In these cases, heart complications were observed. The best markers for diagnosing the severity of the disease in children are the levels of bilirubin and hepatic enzymes. Large number of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on cell surfaces, effective innate immune system, and high level of blood lymphocyte have been reported to be the potent reasons for lower incidence of severe symptoms of COVID-19 among children. Children can very well be the carriers of this virus. Children with severe COVID-19 clinical symptoms, especially those suffering from pneumonia, must be hospitalized similar to adults, while quarantine is required for those having mild symptoms. Antiviral medication (lopinavir, darunavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, tocilizumab, and umifenovir), ACE inhibitors, interferon-alpha 2b, co-therapy with azithromycin, inhaling iNO, and oxygen therapy can be used for treatment. For the treatment of children without any clinical and infection symptoms, home isolation protocol has been recommended.

TI  - Risk factors for hospitalization or mortality for COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases: Results of a nationwide JCR COVID-19 registry in Japan
T2  - MODERN RHEUMATOLOGY
AB  - Objectives The incidence and prognosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and rheumatic disease vary among ethnicities and regions. COVID-19 outcomes in rheumatic disease patients remain unclear, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. This study aimed to clarify the demographic and clinical factors that may influence COVID-19 prognosis in rheumatic disease patients. Methods This was a case series of patients registered with the COVID-19 national registry of Japan College of Rheumatology between 3 June 2020 and 30 June 2021. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of hospitalization or death. Age, sex, smoking status, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities, and rheumatic disease medications are taken immediately before infection was analysed. Results A total of 220 patients from 55 institutions in Japan were included in the study, among whom 186 (84.5%) were hospitalized and 11 (5.0%) died. COVID-19 treatments were provided to 126 patients (57.3%) and mainly comprised glucocorticoids, favipiravir, remdesivir, and tocilizumab. In the multiple logistic regression model, older age and a history of hypertension were associated with hospitalization, while older age was associated with mortality. No specific treatment was correlated with mortality or hospitalization by the multivariate analysis. Conclusions Older age and hypertension were associated with a poor prognosis in Japanese COVID-19 patients with connective tissue disease. Factors not directly related to connective tissue disease were closely associated with the prognosis.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of favipiravir versus hydroxychloroquine in management of COVID-19: A randomised controlled trial
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Favipiravir is considered a potential treatment for COVID-19 due its efficacy against different viral infections. We aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 mild and moderate cases. It was randomized-controlled open-label interventional phase 3 clinical trial [NCT04349241]. 100 patients were recruited from 18th April till 18th May. 50 patients received favipiravir 3200 mg at day 1 followed by 600 mg twice (day 2-day 10). 50 patients received hydroxychloroquine 800 mg at day 1 followed by 200 mg twice (day 2-10) and oral oseltamivir 75 mg/12 h/day for 10 days. Patients were enrolled from Ain Shams University Hospital and Assiut University Hospital. Both arms were comparable as regards demographic characteristics and comorbidities. The average onset of SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity was 8.1 and 8.3 days in HCQ-arm and favipiravir-arm respectively. 55.1% of those on HCQ-arm turned PCR negative at/or before 7th day from diagnosis compared to 48% in favipiravir-arm (p=0.7). 4 patients in FVP arm developed transient transaminitis on the other hand heartburn and nausea were reported in about 20 patients in HCQ-arm. Only one patient in HCQ-arm died after developing acute myocarditis resulted in acute heart failure. Favipiravir is a safe effective alternative for hydroxychloroquine in mild or moderate COVID-19 infected patients.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis which has affected citizens of all nations. With more than a million death cases, this outbreak has already had a significant impact on the physical and mental wellbeing of mankind. Considerable amount of research is going on worldwide to find out effective drugs against the virus. Chloroquine phosphate, an antimalarial drug is currently used for the treatment. Studies on the harmful effects of chloroquine is in progress. India is rich in traditional medical practicing such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani etc. Ministry of AYUSH is trying to implement an interdisciplinary treatment encompassing all traditional methodologies. It is proven that Ashwagandha rasayana (Withania sominefera L.Dunal) has better functions than hydroxychloroquine. The ayurvedic formulations such as Sudarshan Ghanvati and Sanshamanivati are also used. The combination of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin is found to cure COVID-19 more effectively. Use of Tocilizumab is found to cure the respiratory disorders associated with COVID. Favilavir turns out to be yet another effective drug. The alternative medical system has effective prophylaxis and is considered better for the treatment of COVID-19. Ayurveda and yoga improve immunity thus maintaining good health. This review throws light on the mode of progression of the virus along with the various treatment protocols adopted to fight COVID-19. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - SARS CoV-2, a newly emerged pathogen in December 2019, marked as one of the highly pathogenic Coronavirus, and altogether this is the third coronavirus attack that crossed the species barrier. As of 1st July 2020, it is spreading around 216 countries, areas or territories, and a total of 10,185,374 and 503,862 confirmed cases and death reports, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 virus entered into the target cells by binding with the hACE2 receptors. Spike glycopmtein promotes the entry of the virus into host target cells. Literature reported a significant mutation in receptor binding sites and membrane proteins of the previous SARS-CoV to turned as SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for most dreadful pandemic COVID-19. These modifications may be the probable reason for the extreme transmission and pathogenicity of the virus. A hasty spread of COVID-19 throughout the world is highly threatening, but still, scientists do not have a proper therapeutic measure to fight with it. Scientists are endeavoring across the world to find effective therapy to combat COVID 19. Several drugs such as Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Chlomquine, Ribavirin, Ritonavir, Lopinavir, Favipiravir, Interferons, Bevacizumab, Azithromycin, etc. are currently under clinical trials. Vaccine development from various pharmaceutical companies and research institutes is under progress, and more than ten vaccine candidates are in the various phases of clinical trials. This review work highlighted the origin, emergence, structural features, pathogenesis, and clinical features of COVID-19. We have also discussed the in-line treatment strategies, preventive measures, and vaccines to combat the emergence of COVID-19.

T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND
   Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel very contagious infection which was designated a pandemic in all countries of the world in April 2020. Its presentation varies from mild to severe infection, but the majority of infected patients have mild manifestations. Many therapeutic choices have been suggested to treat the infection, but none are fully effective.
   CASE SUMMARY
   Herein we present a 26-year-old woman with a twin pregnancy at 36 wk and one day gestation with confirmed COVID-19 who responded dramatically to convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) and Favipiravir.
   CONCLUSION
   Although this case report shows the efficacy of CPT in addition to usual medications used for COVID-19, there are many questions that need to be answered regarding dosage, para-clinical efficacy, side effects and combination therapy.

AB  - The fight against the novel coronavirus pneumonia (namely COVID-19) that seriously harms human health is a common task for all mankind. Currently, development of drugs against the novel coronavirus (namely SARSCoV-2) is quite urgent. Chinese medical workers and scientific researchers have found some drugs to play potential therapeutic effects on COVID-19 at the cellular level or in preliminary clinical trials. However, more fundamental studies and large sample clinical trials need to be done to ensure the efficacy and safety of these drugs. The adoption of these drugs without further testing must be careful. The relevant articles, news, and government reports published on the official and Preprint websites, PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases from December 2019 to April 2020 were searched and manually filtered. The general pharmacological characteristics, indications, adverse reactions, general usage, and especially current status of the treatment of COVID-19 of those potentially effective drugs, including chemical drugs, traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), and biological products in China were summarized in this review to guide reasonable medication and the development of specific drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Drug Re-purposing Approach and Potential Therapeutic Strategies to Treat COVID-19
T2  - MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - The current pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-Cov-2 has posed a severe threat to the whole world with its highly infectious, progressive nature with up to 10% mortality rates. The severity of the situation faced by the whole world and the lack of efficient therapeutics to treat this viral disease have led the WHO to depend on the drug-repurposing approach to tackle this major global health problem. This review aims at highlighting the various synthetic approaches employed for the synthesis of these FDA approved drugs that have been presently used for COVID-19 treatment. Additionally, a brief overview of several therapeutic strategies is also presented. This review will encourage the scientific community across the globe to come up with better and efficient synthetic protocols and also novel chemical entities along with this core with more potent activity.

TI  - Acute urticaria with Angioedema in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia: Favipiravir side effect or a rare cutaneous manifestation
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE CASE REPORTS
AB  - Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths since it was declared as a pandemic. Recently it continues to be one of the most followed topics in the world in terms of its course and treatment. Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum anti-viral agent that has been shown to be effective against various Coronaviruses in vitro. However, as with any drug use, side effects may develop with the use of favipravir treatment.
   Case Report: We reported a 55-year-old female patient with acute urticarial with angioedema whom had COVID-19 pneumonia. She had no history of allergy, atopy, previous similar episodes or family history of hereditary angioedema. There is no drug or food consumption that may be suspicious in terms of allergy described by the patient other than favipravir.
   Conclusion: As far as we know, it is the first case reported from our country. Since there is no specific examination for differential diagnosis, we cannot distinguish as a rare side effect due to favipiravir treatment or COVID-19 cutaneous manifestation. As a result, studies involving more cases of COVID-19 skin findings are needed.

TI  - Electrochemical and Mechanistic Study of Oxidative Degradation of Favipiravir by Electrogenerated Superoxide through Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer
T2  - ACS OMEGA
AB  - Electrochemical analyses aided by density functional theory calculations were used to investigate the oxidative degradation of pyrazine antiviral drugs, 3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (T-1105) and 6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (favipiravir, T-705), by the electrogenerated superoxide radical anion (O-2(center dot-)). T-1105 and T-705 are antiviral RNA nucleobase analogues that selectively inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. They are expected as a drug candidate against various viral infections, including COVID-19. The pyrazine moiety was decomposed by O-2(center dot-) through proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). Our results show that its active form, pyrazine-ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate, is easily oxidized under inflamed organs by overproduced O-2(center dot-) through the PCET mechanism in the immune system. This mechanistic study implies that the oxidative degradation of pyrazine derivatives will be prevented by controlling the PCET through simple modification of the pyrazine structure.

TI  - An in vitro study of dual drug combinations of anti-viral agents, antibiotics, and/or hydroxychloroquine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated from hospitalized patients in Surabaya, Indonesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - A potent therapy for the infectious coronavirus disease COVID-19 is urgently required with, at the time of writing, research in this area still ongoing. This study aims to evaluate the in vitro anti-viral activities of combinations of certain commercially available drugs that have recently formed part of COVID-19 therapy. Dual combinatory drugs, namely; Lopinavir-Ritonavir (LOPIRITO)-Clarithromycin (CLA), LOPIRITO-Azithromycin (AZI), LOPIRITO-Doxycycline (DOXY), Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)-AZI, HCQ-DOXY, Favipiravir (FAVI)-AZI, HCQ-FAVI, and HCQ-LOPIRITO, were prepared. These drugs were mixed at specific ratios and evaluated for their safe use based on the cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) values of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. The anti-viral efficacy of these combinations in relation to Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated from a patient in Universitas Airlangga hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia and evaluated for IC50 24, 48, and 72 hours after viral inoculation was subsequently determined. Observation of the viral load in qRT-PCR was undertaken, the results of which indicated the absence of high levels of cytotoxicity in any samples and that dual combinatory drugs produced lower cytotoxicity than single drugs. In addition, these combinations demonstrated considerable effectiveness in reducing the copy number of the virus at 48 and 72 hours, while even at 24 hours, post-drug incubation resulted in low IC50 values. Most combination drugs reduced pro-inflammatory markers, i.e. IL-6 and TNF-alpha, while increasing the anti-inflammatory response of IL-10. According to these results, the descending order of effective dual combinatory drugs is one of LOPIRITO-AZI>LOPIRITO-DOXY>HCQ-AZI>HCQ-FAVI>LOPIRITO-CLA>HCQ-DOX. It can be suggested that dual combinatory drugs, e.g. LOPIRITO-AZI, can potentially be used in the treatment of COVID-19 infectious diseases.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Comparison of Favipiravir Oral Solution and Tablet Formulations in Healthy Thai Volunteers
T2  - CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY IN DRUG DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study compared the pharmacokinetics and safety of favipiravir oral solution with those of tablet formulations, which were agents repurposed to treat nonsevere coronavirus disease 2019 in Thailand. In an open-label, single-dose, randomized, crossover study, 24 healthy subjects under fasting conditions were randomly assigned to a single dose of 200 mg of favipiravir, either as an oral solution of 200 mg/15 mL (test product) or a tablet (reference product), separated by a 7-day washout period. Fifteen plasma samples were collected over 12 hours after drug administration. Plasma favipiravir levels were quantified using in-house developed ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The test/reference geometric mean ratio along with 90%CI for the maximum plasma concentration, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to the time of the last quantifiable concentration, and AUC after single-dose administration, extrapolated to infinity were 115.3% (90%CI, 107.7%-123.3%), 100.4% (90%CI, 96.9%-104.0%), and 100.4% (90%CI, 96.8%-104.2%), respectively. These results were within the predefined acceptance criteria for bioequivalence (80.0%-125.0%). No adverse events were observed in either group. The oral solution formulation could offer the advantage of easier swallowing in broader patient groups.

TI  - Clinical Management of COVID-19: A Review of Pharmacological Treatment Options
T2  - PHARMACEUTICALS
AB  - Since the outbreak and subsequent declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic in March 2020, concerted efforts have been applied by the scientific community to curtail the spread of the disease and find a cure. While vaccines constitute a vital part of the public health strategy to reduce the burden of COVID-19, the management of this disease will continue to rely heavily on pharmacotherapy. This study aims to provide an updated review of pharmacological agents that have been developed and/or repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. To this end, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Google Scholar, and LitCovid databases. Relevant clinical studies on drugs used in the management of COVID-19 were identified and evaluated in terms of evidence of efficacy and safety. To date, the FDA has approved three therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorization: convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and casirivimab/imdevimab (REGN-COV2). Drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, anakinra, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons, tissue plasminogen activator, intravenous immunoglobulins, and nafamosat have been used off-label with mixed therapeutic results. Adjunctive administration of corticosteroids is also very common. The clinical experience with these approved and repurposed drugs is limited, and data on efficacy for the new indication are not strong. Overall, the response of the global scientific community to the COVID-19 pandemic has been impressive, as evident from the volume of scientific literature elucidating the molecular biology and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and the approval of three new drugs for clinical management. Reviewed studies have shown mixed data on efficacy and safety of the currently utilized drugs. The lack of standard treatment for COVID-19 has made it difficult to interpret results from most of the published studies due to the risk of attribution error. The long-term effects of drugs can only be assessed after several years of clinical experience; therefore, the efficacy and safety of current COVID-19 therapeutics should continue to be rigorously monitored as part of post-marketing studies.

TI  - COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE, FAVIPIRAVIR, AND HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE PLUS FAVIPIRAVIR ON SURVIVAL OF GERIATRIC POPULATION WITH COVID-19-RELATED PNEUMONIA: A PROPENSITY SCORE-MATCHED ANALYSIS
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF GERIATRICS-TURK GERIATRI DERGISI
AB  - Introduction: Elderly patients are among the most vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir, separately and in combination, have been used in the general population, their benefits are unclear, especially in the geriatric population. This study aims to compare the effects of different drug regimens on the clinical outcomes of elderly patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia. Materials and methods: This retrospective cohort study, conducted in a tertiary healthcare center between April 2020 and October 2020, included all patients over 65 years of age admitted to the emergency department with confirmed COVID-19-related pneumonia. Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were recorded. The patients were classified into hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine plus favipiravir treatment groups. Propensity score matching was performed to balance the differences between the groups. The primary outcome was 30-day survival. The secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and the need for mechanical ventilation. Results: A total of 335 patients were included in the study; 144 were matched according to the propensity scores and divided into groups of 48 each. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups' survival curves. The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the favipiravir group. No significant difference was detected in mortality or the need for noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: The hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine plus favipiravir treatments had similar effects on 30-day survival, mortality, and the need for mechanical ventilation. The length of hospital stay was longer in the patients treated with favipiravir.

TI  - Highly sensitive high-performance thin-layer chromatography method for the simultaneous determination of molnupiravir, favipiravir, and ritonavir in pure forms and pharmaceutical formulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEPARATION SCIENCE
AB  - Favipiravir, molnupiravir, and ritonavir have been recently approved as the first oral antivirals for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 viral infections. Their combination was reported in several clinical studies, alternatively, to enhance the viral eradication and improve patient's recovery times and rates. Being all orally administered, therefore, the development of new sensitive and validated methodologies for their simultaneous determination is a necessitate. In the proposed research, a sensitive, selective, and simple high-performance thin layer chromatography method was developed and validated for determination of favipiravir, molnupiravir, and ritonavir. Silica gel 60F254 thin layer chromatography plates were used as stationary phase for this separation using mobile phase composed of methylene chloride:ethyl acetate:methanol:25% ammonia (6:3:4:1, v/v/v/v). Densitometric detection was performed at wavelength 289 nm. Peaks of favipiravir, molnupiravir, and ritonavir were resolved at retention factors 0.22, 0.42, and 0.63, respectively. The proposed method was found linear within the specified ranges of 3.75-100.00 mu g/ml for molnupiravir and favipiravir, and 2.75-100.00 mu g/ml for ritonavir. Limits of detection were found to be 1.12, 1.21, and 0.89 mu g/ml for favipiravir, molnupiravir, and ritonavir, respectively. This is the first method to be reported for the simultaneous determination of the cited three antiviral drugs. The method was assessed on novel greenness metrics.

TI  - Current status and strategic possibilities on potential use of combinational drug therapy against COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - The spread of new coronavirus infection starting December 2019 as novel SARS-CoV-2, identified as the causing agent of COVID-19, has affected all over the world and been declared as pandemic. Approximately, more than 8,807,398 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and 464,483 deaths have been reported globally till the end of 21 June 2020. Until now, there is no specific drug therapy or vaccine available for the treatment of COVID-19. However, some potential antimalarial drugs like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, antifilarial drug ivermectin and antiviral drugs have been tested by many research groups worldwide for their possible effect against the COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin have been identified to act by creating the acidic condition in cells and inhibiting the importin (IMP alpha/beta 1) mediated viral import. There is a possibility that some other antimalarial drugs/antibiotics in combination with immunomodulators may help in combatting this pandemic disease. Therefore, this review focuses on the current use of various drugs as single agents (hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin, favipiravir, remdesivir, umifenovir, teicoplanin, nitazoxanide, doxycycline, and dexamethasone) or in combinations with immunomodulators additionally. Furthermore, possible mode of action, efficacy and current stage of clinical trials of various drug combinations against COVID-19 disease has also been discussed in detail.

TI  - Comparative assessment of favipiravir and remdesivir against human coronavirus NL63 in molecular docking and cell culture models
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) mainly affects young children and immunocompromised patients, causing morbidity and mortality in a subset of patients. Since no specific treatment is available, this study aims to explore the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents including favipiravir and remdesivir for treating HCoV-NL63 infection. We first successfully modelled the 3D structure of HCoV-NL63 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) based on the experimentally solved SARS-CoV-2 RdRp structure. Molecular docking indicated that favipiravir has similar binding affinities to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 RdRp with LibDock scores of 75 and 74, respectively. The LibDock scores of remdesivir to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 were 135 and 151, suggesting that remdesivir may have a higher affinity to HCoV-NL63 compared to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In cell culture models infected with HCoV-NL63, both favipiravir and remdesivir significantly inhibited viral replication and production of infectious viruses. Overall, remdesivir compared to favipiravir is more potent in inhibiting HCoV-NL63 in cell culture. Importantly, there is no evidence of resistance development upon long-term exposure to remdesivir. Furthermore, combining favipiravir or remdesivir with the clinically used antiviral cytokine interferon-alpha resulted in synergistic effects. These findings provided a proof-of-concept that anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, in particular remdesivir, have the potential to be repurposed for treating HCoV-NL63 infection.

TI  - Structural Bioinformatics Used to Predict the Protein Targets of Remdesivir and Flavones in SARS-CoV-2 Infection
T2  - MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Background: During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the identification of effective antiviral drugs is crucial. Unfortunately, no specific treatment or vaccine is available to date.
   Objective: Here, we aimed to predict the interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and protein targets from the human body for some flavone molecules (kaempferol, morin, pectolinarin, myricitrin, and herbacetin) in comparison to synthetic compounds (hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, ribavirin, ritonavir, AMD-070, favipiravir).
   Methods: Using MOE software and advanced bioinformatics and cheminformatics portals, we conducted an extensive analysis based on various structural and functional features of compounds, such as their amphiphilic field, flexibility, and steric features. The structural similarity analysis of natural and synthetic compounds was performed using Tanimoto coefficients. The interactions of some compounds with SARS-CoV-2 3CLprotease or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were described using 2D protein-ligand interaction diagrams based on known crystal structures. The potential targets of considered compounds were identified using the SwissTargetPrediction web tool.
   Results: Our results showed that remdesivir, pectolinarin, and ritonavir present a strong structural similarity which may be correlated to their similar biological activity. As common molecular targets of compounds in the human body, ritonavir, kaempferol, morin, and herbacetin can activate multi drug resistance-associated proteins, while remdesivir, ribavirin, and pectolinarin appear as ligands for adenosine receptors.
   Conclusion: Our evaluation recommends remdesivir, pectolinarin, and ritonavir as promising antiSARS-CoV-2 agents.

TI  - A Single-Centered Cohort Study on Favipiravir Safety and Efficacy in Pediatric Patients with COVID-19
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the pediatric population. Objectives: Due to limited data, this study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of favipiravir in the hospitalized pediatric pop-ulation diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: The present retrospective cohort study was conducted on pediatric patients aged 1-18 years with a diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to Mofid Children's Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Favipiravir was administrated at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day (max: 3200 mg/day) on the first day and then 23 mg/kg/day (max: 1200 mg/day) for 7 to 14 days. The patients were evaluated regarding the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, duration of hospital stay, and mortality. Safety was measured by the occurrence of related adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Results: A total of 95 patients were included in the study. Favipiravir was administered to 25 patients. The need for invasive me-chanical ventilation was reported in 4 (16.00%) and 11 (15.71%) patients in the favipiravir and control groups, respectively (P = 1.000). The median duration of hospital stays was significantly higher in patients who received favipiravir than in the controls (P = 0.002). No difference was observed in the mortality rate (P = 0.695). The ADRs, including decreased appetite, hypotension, and chest pain, were more prevalent in patients who received favipiravir than in the controls (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The administration of favipiravir in the pediatric population is associated with higher ADR occurrence with no pos-itive effect on the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, hospital stay, and mortality. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary for better judgment.

TI  - Antiviral Used among Non-Severe COVID-19 Cases in Relation to Time till Viral Clearance: A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
AB  - (1) Background: The WHO identified COVID-19 as a fast-growing epidemic worldwide. A few antivirals have shown promising effectiveness in treating COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the correlation between antiviral drugs and the time until viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2. (2) Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study that included 1731 non-severe COVID-19 patients treated in NMC Royal Hospital, UAE. (3) Results: A total of 1446 patients received symptomatic treatment only (mean age of 35.6 +/- 9.0 years). The analyzed antiviral treatment protocols were azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir. The produced Kaplan-Meier plots showed no significant differences in the time until viral clearance among the compared protocols, which showed overlapping confidence intervals, which were determined by performing the log-rank and adjusted pairwise log-rank tests (p = 0.2, log-rank = 9.3). The age and gender of patients did not significantly affect the rate of viral clearance regardless of the antiviral therapy administered, even when compared to patients who received symptomatic treatment only, with the exception of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, and favipiravir, which increased the odds of a faster rate of viral clearance by 46% after adjustments. (4) Conclusions: No significant differences were observed regarding the time until viral clearance among non-severe COVID-19 patients following the prescription of different antiviral drugs.

TI  - Favipiravir treatment does not influence disease progression among adult patients hospitalized with moderate-to-severe COVID-19: a prospective, sequential cohort study from Hungary
T2  - GEROSCIENCE
AB  - Data suggests that favipiravir (FVP) could be used against SARS-CoV-2. Our aim was to investigate the role of FVP in COVID-19 treatment. A prospective sequential cohort study was performed among adults hospitalized at our center between March and August 2020 with moderate-to-severe, PCR-confirmed COVID-19. For diagnosis and severity, ECDC and WHO definitions were utilized. Patients were screened for inclusion by a priori criteria and included in the FVP cohort if standard-of-care (SOC) + FVP or the non-FVP cohort if SOC +/- other antivirals without FVP were administered for > 48 h from diagnosis. Treatment allocation was done per national guidelines, based on severity and drug availability. Primary endpoint was disease progression, a composite of 14-day all-cause death, need for mechanical ventilation, or immunomodulatory therapy. The impact of FVP exposure on disease progression was analyzed by binomial logistic regression. In all, 150 patients were included, 75 in each cohort. Disease progression (17/75, 22.7% vs. 10/75, 13.3%, p = 0.13), 14-day all-cause death (9/75, 12.0% vs. 10/75, 13.3%, p = 0.8), and need for mechanical ventilation (8/75, 10.7% vs. 4/75, 5.3%, p = 0.22) were similar, while immunomodulatory therapies were required more frequently among patients receiving FVP (10/75, 13.3% vs. 1/75, 1.3%, p < 0.01). The use of favipiravir was not retained as a protective factor against disease progression in multivatiate analysis. Time to antiviral therapy from PCR positivity, disease severity, need for oxygen supportation, and ICU admittance rates did not differ statistically between cohorts. In this study, favipiravir did not seem to positively affect disease progression.

TI  - Acute Hypertriglyceridaemia Caused by Tocilizumab in a Patient with Severe COVID-19
T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Treatment with tocilizumab (TCZ) to block interleukin-6 (IL-6) signalling is predicted to mitigate cytokine release syndrome (CRS) caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the adverse effects of TCZ on patients with COVID-19 remain unclear. We herein report a patient with COVID-19 treated with TCZ who developed acute hypertriglyceridaemia. Despite favipiravir treatment, acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in a 45-year-old patient with COVID-19; thus, TCZ was initiated. The triglyceride levels greatly increased after TCZ administration. Physicians should consider the negative impact of TCZ on the lipid profile in patients with COVID-19, although COVID-19-induced CRS itself may be an aggravating factor.

TI  - Antiviral Drug Delivery System for Enhanced Bioactivity, Better Metabolism and Pharmacokinetic Characteristics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
AB  - Antiviral drugs (AvDs) are the primary resource in the global battle against viruses, including the recent fight against corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most AvDs require multiple medications, and their use frequently leads to drug resistance, since they have poor oral bioavailability and low efficacy due to their low solubility/low permeability. Characterizing the in vivo metabolism and pharmacokinetic characteristics of AvDs may help to solve the problems associated with AvDs and enhance their efficacy. In this review of AvDs, we systematically investigated their structure-based metabolic reactions and related enzymes, their cellular pharmacology, and the effects of metabolism on AvD pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. We further assessed how delivery systems achieve better metabolism and pharmacology of AvDs. This review suggests that suitable nanosystems may help to achieve better pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetic behavior of AvDs by altering drug metabolism through the utilization of advanced nanotechnology and appropriate administration routes. Notably, such AvDs as ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir, chloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir have been confirmed to bind to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) receptor and thus may represent anti-COVID-19 treatments. Elucidating the metabolic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of AvDs may help pharmacologists to identify new formulations with high bioavailability and efficacy and help physicians to better treat virus-related diseases, including COVID-19.

TI  - Exploring chemistry features of favipiravir in octanol/water solutions
T2  - MAIN GROUP CHEMISTRY
AB  - Favipiravir (Fav) has become a well-known drug for medication of patients by appearance of COVID-19. Heterocyclic structure and connected peptide group could make changes for Fav yielding different features from those required features. Therefore, it is indeed a challenging task to prepare a Fav compound with specific features of desired function. In this work, existence of eight Fav structures by tautomeric formations and peptide group rotations were obtained using density functional theory (DFT) optimization calculations. Gas phase, octanol solution, and water solution were employed to show impact of solution on features of Fav besides obtaining partition coefficients (LogP) for Fav compounds. Significant impacts of solutions were seen on features of Fav with the obtained LogP order: Fav-7 > Fav-8 > Fav-4 > Fav-3 > Fav-2 > Fav-5 > Fav-1 > Fav-6. As a consequence, internal changes yielded significant impacts on features of Fav affirming its carful medication of COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Coronavirus RNA Proofreading: Molecular Basis and Therapeutic Targeting
T2  - MOLECULAR CELL
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is wreaking havoc on worldwide public health and economies has heightened awareness about the lack of effective antiviral treatments for human coronaviruses (CoVs). Many current antivirals, notably nucleoside analogs (NAs), exert their effect by incorporation into viral genomes and subsequent disruption of viral replication and fidelity. The development of anti-CoV drugs has long been hindered by the capacity of CoVs to proofread and remove mismatched nucleotides during genome replication and transcription. Here, we review the molecular basis of the CoV proofreading complex and evaluate its potential as a drug target. We also consider existing nucleoside analogs and novel genomic techniques as potential anti-CoV therapeutics that could be used individually or in combination to target the proofreading mechanism.

TI  - COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients: Experience from a Western Indian center
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF NEPHROLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Chronic kidney disease patients on hemodialysis (CKD-5D) are among the worst hit by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Need to travel for dialysis, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive state put them at risk of severe disease and poor outcomes. We report our experience of COVID-19 in a cohort of CKD-5D from a public sector tertiary-care center from western India. Material and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 58 CKD-5D patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our COVID-19 hospital. Suspected COVID-19, acute kidney injury (AKI), or AKI on CKD were excluded. We studied the clinical, demographic, radiological, and laboratory profiles; treatment; and outcomes of the patients. We assessed the potential clinical and laboratory parameters to predict mortality. Results: The mean age of the patients was 48.7 & PLUSMN; 16.9 years, with 55% males. Comorbidities included hypertension (65%), diabetes (19%), and cardiovascular disease (15.5%). The presenting features included fever (69%), respiratory distress (50%), upper respiratory symptoms (36%), and diarrhea (13%). Five (8.6%) were asymptomatic. Bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging were the commonest radiological pattern. The patients were managed with oxygenation, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, anticoagulation, remdesivir, and favipiravir. Twenty-two (37.9%) patients died, predominantly due to respiratory failure. Disease severity and C-reactive protein (CRP) above 175 mg/L at admission were the only parameters predictive of mortality. Conclusion: CKD-5D patients with COVID-19 were less likely to present with the classical syndrome of fever and respiratory distress compared with reports from the general population and had higher mortality. Only disease severity and high CRP (> 175 mg/L) were predictive of mortality in our cohort.

TI  - Statins and the COVID-19 main protease: in silico evidence on direct interaction
T2  - ARCHIVES OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction: No proven drug and no immunisation are yet available for COVID-19 disease. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a key coronavirus enzyme, which is a potential drug target, has been successfully crystallised. There is evidence suggesting that statins exert anti-viral activity and may block the infectivity of enveloped viruses. The aim of this study was to assess whether statins are potential COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors, using a molecular docking study.
   Material and methods: Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock/Vina, a computational docking program. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was docked with all statins, while antiviral and antiretroviral drugs - favipiravir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir - were used as standards for comparison.
   Results: The binding energies obtained from the docking of 6LU7 with native ligand favipiravir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin were -6.8, -5.8, -7.9, -7.9, -7.0, -7.7, -6.6, -8.2, -7.4, -7.7, and -6.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The number of hydrogen bonds between statins and amino acid residues of Mpro were 7, 4, and 3 for rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin, respectively, while other statins had two hydrogen bonds.
   Conclusions: These results indicate, based upon the binding energy of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin, that statins could be efficient SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. This is supported by the fact that the effects of some statins, especially pitavastatin, have a binding energy that is even greater than that of protease or polymerase inhibitors. However, further research is necessary to investigate their potential use as drugs for COVID-19.

TI  - Insight into the biological impact of COVID-19 and its vaccines on human health
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) is a contagious illness that has been declared a global epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The coronavirus causes diseases ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory diseases and death. Coronavirus primarily affects blood pressure by attaching to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor. This virus has an impact on multiple organ systems, including the central nervous system, immune system, cardiovascular system, peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine system, urinary system, skin, and pregnancy. For the prevention of COVID-19, various vaccines such as viral-like particle vaccines, entire inactivated virus vaccines, viral vector vaccines, live attenuated virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, RNA vaccines, and DNA vaccines are now available. Some of the COVID-19 vaccines are reported to cause a variety of adverse effects that range from mild to severe in nature. SARS-CoV-2 replication is controlled by the RNA-Dependent RNA-Polymerase enzyme (RdRp). The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs (Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir) as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that tightly bind to its RdRp may aid in the treatment of patients and reduce the risk of the mysterious new form of COVID19 viral infection. RdRp inhibitors, such as remdesivir (an anti-Ebola virus experimental drug) and favipiravir (an anti-influenza drug), inhibit RdRp and thus slow the progression of COVID-19 and associated clinical symptoms, as well as significantly shorten recovery time. Molnupiravir, an orally active RdRp inhibitor and noval broad spectrum antiviral agent, is an isopropyl pro-drug of EIDD-1931 for emergency use. Galidesivir's in vitro and in vivo activities are limited to RNA of human public health concern. Top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to combat the SARS-CoV-2 strain include guanosine derivatives (IDX-184), setrobuvir, and YAK. The goal of this review is to compile scattered information on available COVID-19 vaccines and other treatments for protecting the human body from their harmful effects and to provide options for making better choices in a timely manner.

TI  - Targeting COVID-19 in Parkinson's Patients: Drugs Repurposed
T2  - CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - The last couple of months have witnessed the world in a state of virtual standstill. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has overtaken the globe to economic and social lockdown. Many patients with COVID-19 have compromised immunity, especially in an aged population suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD).
   Alteration in dopaminergic neurons and deficiency of dopamine in PD patients are the most common symptoms affecting 1% population above the age of 60 years. The compromised immune system and inflammatory manifestation in PD patients make them an easy target. The most common drugs under trial for COVID-19 are remdesivir, favipiravir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin along with adjunct drugs like amantadine with some monoclonal antibodies.
   Presently, clinically US FDA approved drugs in PD include Levodopa, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors, (Entacapone and Tolcapone), dopamine agonists (Bromocriptine, Ropinirole, Pramipexole, and Rotigotine), monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors (Selegiline and Rasagiline), amantadine and antimuscarinic drugs. The drugs have established mechanisms of action on PD patients with known pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties along with dose and adverse effects.
   Conclusion and relevance of this review focus on the drugs that can be tried on PD patients with SAR CoV-2 infection, in particular, amantadine that has been approved by all the developed countries as a common drug possessing both antiviral properties by downregulation of CTSL, lysosomal pathway disturbance and change in pH necessary to uncoat the viral proteins and anti-Parkinson properties. To deal with the significant prognostic adverse effect of SARS-CoV-2 on PD, the present-day treatment options, clinical presentation and various mechanisms are the need of the hour.

TI  - Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in patients with COVID-19
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - We report the first two cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) who were receiving intensive care including favipiravir, and were clinically diagnosed with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) to focus attention on NMS in COVID-19 management. Case 1: A 46-year-old-man with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 infection was being administered favipiravir. Fentanyl, propofol, and rocuronium were also given. On day 3, midazolam administration was initiated for deep sedation. On day 5, his high body temperature increased to 41.2 degrees C, creatine kinase level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS was suspected, and supportive therapy was initiated. High-grade fever persisted for 4 days and subsided on day 9. Case 2: A 44-year-old-man with ARDS caused by COVID-19 infection was being treated with favipiravir. On day 5, risperidone was started for delirium. On day 7, his body temperature suddenly increased to 40.8 degrees C, his CK level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS diagnosis was confirmed, and both, favipiravir and risperidone were discontinued on day 8. On the same day, his CK levels decreased, and his body temperature normalized on day 9.
   Patients with COVID-19 infection frequently require deep sedation and develop delirium; therefore, more attention should be paid to the development of NMS in patients who are being administered such causative agents. The mechanism underlying the occurrence of NMS in COVID-19 patients treated with favipiravir remains unknown. Therefore, careful consideration of NMS development is necessary in the management of COVID-19 patients. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A novel LC-MS/MS method for determination of the potential antiviral candidate favipiravir for the emergency treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus in human plasma: Application to a bioequivalence study in Egyptian human volunteers
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS
AB  - A novel, fast and sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the bioanalysis of the antiviral agent favipiravir (FAV); a promising candidate for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in human plasma using pyrazinamide as an internal standard (IS). Simple protein precipitation was adopted for plasma sample preparation using methanol. Chromatographic separation was accomplished on Eclipse plus C-18 column (50 x 4.6 mm, 3.5 mu m) using a mobile phase composed of methanol-0.2 % acetic acid (20:80, v/v) pumped at a flow rate 0.6 mL/min in an isocratic elution mode. The API4500 triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer was operated with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) in negative electrospray ionization interface for FAV and positive for IS. The MRM function was used for quantification, with the transitions set at m/z156.00 113.00 and m/z124.80 81.00 for FAV and IS. The method was optimized and fully validated in accordance to US-FDA guidelines. Linearity was acquired over a concentration range of 100.0-20000.0 ng/mL by computing using weighted linear regression strategy (1/x(2)). The proposed method was effectively applied for the pharmacokinetic evaluation of FAV and to demonstrate the bioequivalence of a new FAV formulation (test) and reference product in healthy Egyptian human volunteers.

TI  - Tissue-Specific Proteomics Analysis of Anti-COVID-19 Nucleoside and Nucleotide Prodrug-Activating Enzymes Provides Insights into the Optimization of Prodrug Design and Pharmacotherapy Strategy
T2  - ACS PHARMACOLOGY & TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE
AB  - Nucleoside and nucleotide analogs are an essential class of antivirals for COVID-19 treatment. Several nucleoside/nucleotide analogs have shown promising effects against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro; however, their in vivo efficacy is limited. Nucleoside/nucleotide analogs are often formed as ester prodrugs to improve pharmacokinetics (PK) performance. After entering cells, the prodrugs undergo several enzymatic metabolism steps to form the active metabolite triphosphate nucleoside (TP-Nuc); prodrug activation is therefore associated with the abundance and catalytic activity of the corresponding activating enzymes. Having the activation of nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs occur at the target site of action, such as the lung, is critical for anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Herein, we conducted an absolute quantitative proteomics study to determine the expression of relevant activating enzymes in human organs related to the PK and antiviral efficacy of nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs, including the lung, liver, intestine, and kidney. The protein levels of prodrug-activating enzymes differed significantly among the tissues. Using catalytic activity values reported previously for individual enzymes, we calculated prodrug activation profiles in these tissues. The prodrugs evaluated in this study include nine McGuigan phosphoramidate prodrugs, two cyclic monophosphate prodrugs, two L-valyl ester prodrugs, and one octanoate prodrug. Our analysis showed that most orally administered nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs were primarily activated in the liver, suggesting that parenteral delivery routes such as inhalation and intravenous infusion could be better options when these antiviral prodrugs are used to treat COVID-19. The results also indicated that the L-valyl ester prodrug design can plausibly improve drug bioavailability and enhance effects against SARS-CoV-2 intestinal infections. This study further revealed that an octanoate prodrug could provide a long-acting antiviral effect targeting SARS-CoV-2 infections in the lung. Finally, our molecular docking analysis suggested several prodrug forms of favipiravir and GS-441524 that are likely to exhibit favorable PK features over existing prodrug forms. In sum, this study revealed the activation mechanisms of various nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs relevant to COVID-19 treatment in different organs and shed light on the development of more effective anti-COVID-19 prodrugs.

TI  - Computational Evidences of Phytochemical Mediated Disruption of PLpro Driven Replication of SARS-CoV-2: A Therapeutic Approach Against COVID-19
T2  - CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Background: COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been declared as a global pandemic by WHO. Comprehensive analysis of this unprecedented outbreak may help to fight against the disease and may play a pivotal role in decreasing the mortality rate linked with it. Papain-like protease (PLpro), a multifunctional polyprotein, facilitates the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and evades it from the host immunological response by antagonizing cytokines, interferons and may be considered as a potential drug target to combat the current pandemic. Methods: Natural moieties obtained from medicinal plants were analysed for their potency to target PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular docking study and were compared with synthetic analogs named as remdesivir, chloroquine and favipiravir. The stability of complexes of top hits was analysed by MD Simulation, and interaction energy was calculated. Furthermore, average RMSD values were computed and deepsite ligand-binding pockets were predicted using Play Molecule. Drug-like-abilities of these moieties were determined using ADMET and bond distance between the ligand and active site was as-sessed to predict the strength of the interaction.
   Results: Nimbocinol (-7.6 Kcal/mol) and sage (-7.3 Kcal/mol) exhibited maximum BA against PLpro SARS-CoV-2 as evident from molecular docking study, which was found to be even better than remdesivir (-6.1 Kcal/mol), chloroquine (-5.3 Kcal/mol) and favipiravir (-5.7 Kcal/mol). Both nim-bocinol-PLpro and sage-PLpro SARS-CoV-2 complex exhibited stable conformation during MD Sim-ulation of 101ns at 310 K, and potential, kinetic and electrostatic interaction energies were computed, which was observed to be concordant with results of molecular docking study. RMSD average values were found to be 0.496 +/- 0.015 A and 0.598 +/- 0.023 A for nimbocinol and sage, respectively, thus re-vealing that both the deviation and fluctuations during MD Simulation were observed to be least. Deepsite prediction disclosed that both compounds occupied cryptic pockets in receptor and non-bond distance analysis revealed the formation of hydrogen bonds during ligand-receptor interaction. AD-MET exploration further validated the drug-like properties of these compounds.
   Conclusion: Present study revealed that active constituents of Azadirachta indica and Salvia officinalis can be potentially used to target SARS-CoV-2 by hindering its replication process.

TI  - The time to offer treatments for COVID-19
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS
AB  - Background: COVID-19 has several overlapping phases. Treatments to date have focused on the late stage of disease in hospital. Yet, the pandemic is by propagated by the viral phase in out-patients. The current public health strategy relies solely on vaccines to prevent disease.Methods: We searched the major national registries, pubmed.org, and the preprint servers for all ongoing, completed and published trial results.Results: As of 2/15/2021, we found 111 publications reporting findings on 14 classes of agents, and 9 vaccines. There were 62 randomized controlled studies, the rest retrospective observational analyses. Only 21 publications dealt with outpatient care. Remdesivir and high titer convalescent plasma have emergency use authorization for hospitalized patients in the U.S.A. There is also support for glucocorticoid treatment of the COVID-19 respiratory distress syndrome. Monoclonal antibodies are authorized for outpatients, but supply is inadequate to treat all at time of diagnosis. Favipiravir, ivermectin, and interferons are approved in certain countries.Expert Opinion: Vaccines and antibodies are highly antigen specific, and new SARS-Cov-2 variants are appearing. We call on public health authorities to authorize treatments with known low-risk and possible benefit for outpatients in parallel with universal vaccination.

TI  - Antiviral treatment of COVID-19
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Currently, there is not any specific effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Although most of the COVID-19 patients have mild or moderate courses, up to 5%-10% can have severe, potentially life threatening course, there is an urgent need for effective drugs. Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy. There have been more than 300 clinical trials going on, various antiviral and immunomodulating agents are in various stages of evaluation for COVID-19 in those trials and some of them will be published in the next couple of months. Despite the urgent need to find an effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19 through randomized controlled studies, certain agents are being used all over the world based on either in-vitro or extrapolated evidence or observational studies. The most frequently used agents both in Turkey and all over the world including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir will be reviewed here. Nitazoxanide and ivermectin were also included in this review as they have recently been reported to have an activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and are licensed for the treatment of some other human infections.

TI  - Statins in COVID-19 Therapy
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
AB  - Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3methylgultaryl-coenzyme A reductase (statins) are one of the main groups of drugs used in preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases worldwide. They are widely available, cheap, and well-tolerated. Based on statins' pleiotropic properties, including improvement of endothelial dysfunction, antioxidant properties, atherosclerotic plaque stabilization, and inhibition of inflammatory responses, it can be hypothesized that the use of statins, at least as an adjuvant in antiviral therapy, may be justified. All these effects might be especially beneficial in patients with COVID-19, suffering from endothelial dysfunction, microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis, and cytokine storm. Here, we review the recent data regarding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 activity in host cells, proposed COVID-19 therapy, the pleiotropic activity of statins, and statins in clinical trials in respiratory infections. According to the guidelines of the European and American Cardiac Societies, in patients with cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk with concomitant COVID-19 it is recommended to continue statin treatment. However, the initiation of statin therapy de novo in COVID-19 treatment should only be done as part of a clinical trial.

T2  - JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - We started a study on the molecular docking of six potential pharmacologically active inhibitors compounds that can be used clinically against the COVID-19 virus, in this case, remdesivir, ribavirin, favipiravir, galidesivir, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine interacting with the main COVID-19 protease in complex with a COVID-19 N3 protease inhibitor. The highest values of affinity energy found in order from highest to lowest were chloroquine (CHL), hydroxychloroquine (HYC), favipiravir (FAV), galidesivir (GAL), remdesivir (REM) and ribavirin (RIB). The possible formation of hydrogen bonds, associations through London forces and permanent electric dipole were analyzed. The values of affinity energy obtained for the hydroxychloroquine ligands was -9.9 kcal/mol and for the chloroquine of -10.8 kcal/mol which indicate that the coupling contributes to an effective improvement of the affinity energies with the protease. Indicating that, the position chosen to make the substitutions may be a pharmacophoric group, and cause changes in the protease.

TI  - A single-center report of COVID-19 disease course and management in liver transplanted pediatric patients
T2  - PEDIATRIC TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Background: In 2019, SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 emerged. Severe COVID-19 symptoms may evolve by virtue of hyperactivation of the immune system. Equally, immunocompromised patients may be at increased risk to develop COVID-19. However, treatment guidelines for children following liver transplantation are elusive.
   Methods: As a liver transplantation center, we diagnosed and followed up 10 children (male/female: 8/2) with a median age of 8.5 years (IQR: 5.2-11.0), with COVID-19 post-liver transplant between March 2019 and December 2020. COVID-19 diagnosis was based on PCR test and or florid X-ray findings compatible with COVID-19 in the absence of other cause. We retrospectively collected clinical and laboratory data from electronic patient records following written consent from patients/parents.
   Results: Nine patients were diagnosed as definitive (PCR positive) with one patient being diagnosed as probable COVID-19. Seven patients recovered without any support whereas three were admitted for non-invasive oxygenation. Lymphopenia and/or high levels of serum IL-6 were detected in four patients. Six patients mounted anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at median 30 days (IQR: 26.5-119.0) following COVID-19 diagnosis. Antibiotic therapy, favipiravir, anakinra, and IVIG were used as treatment in 4,1,1 and 2 patients, respectively. Furthermore, we kept the tacrolimus with or without everolimus but stopped MMF in 2 patients. Importantly, liver allograft function was retained in all patients.
   Conclusions: We found that being immunocompromised did not affect disease severity nor survival. Stopping MMF yet continuing with tacrolimus was an apt treatment modality in these patients.

TI  - Coronaviruses as the emerging threats for human health: should we be prepared for the future outbreaks of new coronaviruses?
T2  - BRATISLAVA MEDICAL JOURNAL-BRATISLAVSKE LEKARSKE LISTY
AB  - Recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in human communities as the first major zoonotic pandemics of the new millennium following the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has increased our awareness about the future threat of viral zoonosis. Although, several studies have been conducted for better understanding of these viruses' evolution, and designing the effective anti-viral drugs and vaccines, the impact of human beings on occurrence of zoonotic diseases has been less considered and discussed. Improvement in global health resulted in human population growth, increasing demand for animal proteins, more exposures to wildlife, zoonotic and degradation of environment, which have facilitated interspecies transmissions. Since world population is increasing proportionately, the protection of public health against zoonotic diseases is a challenging task. It seems that intensified revision of human lifestyle is the best strategy to prevent the potential devastating future zoonotic pandemics. Herein, the characteristics of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, their transmission routs, their pathogenicity, the therapeutic and prevention approaches including of attempts for designing of effective prophylactic vaccines, anti-viral drugs, and the animal models that have been used for these studies have been reviewed (Ref. 134).

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Response against Mild-to-Moderate Breakthrough COVID-19 in Home Isolation Setting in Thailand
T2  - VACCINES
AB  - Background: In December 2021, Omicron replaced Delta as the dominant coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) variant in Thailand. Both variants embody diverse epidemiological trends and immunogenicity. We investigated whether Delta and Omicron patients' biological and clinical characteristics and immunogenicity differed post-COVID-19 infection. Methods: This retrospective cohort study investigated the clinical outcomes and laboratory data of 5181 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (Delta, 2704; Omicron, 2477) under home isolation. We evaluated anti-receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G (anti-RBD IgG) and surrogate viral neutralizing (sVNT) activity in 495 individuals post-COVID-19 infection during the Delta pandemic. Results: Approximately 84% of all patients received favipiravir. The median cycle threshold (Ct) values were lower for Omicron patients than Delta patients (19 vs. 21; p < 0.001), regardless of vaccination status. Upper respiratory tract symptoms were more frequent with Omicron patients than Delta patients. There were no significant associations between Ct and Omicron symptoms (95% confidence interval 0.98-1.02). A two-dose vaccine regimen reduced hospital readmission by 10% to 30% and death by under 1%. Anti-RBD IgG and sVNT against Delta were higher among older individuals post-COVID-19 infection. Older individuals expressed anti-RBD IgG and sVNT for a more extended period after two-dose vaccination than other age groups. Conclusions: After a full vaccination course, breakthrough mild-to-moderate Delta and Omicron infections have limited immunogenicity. Prior infections exert reduced protection against later reinfection or infection from novel variants. However, this protection may be sufficient to prevent hospitalization and death, particularly in countries where vaccine supplies are limited.

TI  - Antimicrobial Prescribing Patterns in Patients with COVID-19 in Russian Multi-Field Hospitals in 2021: Results of the Global-PPS Project
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health challenge with understudied effects on antimicrobial usage. We aimed to analyze antimicrobial prescribing patterns in COVID-19 patients in Russian multi-field hospitals by means of the Global-PPS Project developed by the University of Antwerp. Out of 999 patients in COVID-19 wards in six hospitals surveyed in 2021, 51.3% received antimicrobials (79% in intensive care, 47.5% in medical wards). Systemic antivirals and antibiotics were prescribed to 31% and 35.1% of patients, respectively, and a combination of both to 14.1% of patients. The top antivirals administered were favipiravir (65%), remdesivir (19.2%), and umifenovir (15.8%); the top antibiotics were ceftriaxone (29.7%), levofloxacin (18%), and cefoperazone/sulbactam (10.4%). The vast majority of antibiotics was prescribed for treatment of pneumonia or COVID-19 infection (59.3% and 25.1%, respectively). Treatment was based on biomarker data in 42.7% of patients but was targeted only in 29.6% (6.7% for antibiotics). The rate of non-compliance with guidelines reached 16.6%. Antimicrobial prescribing patterns varied considerably in COVID-19 wards in Russian hospitals with groundlessly high rates of systemic antibiotics. Antimicrobial usage surveillance and stewardship should be applied to inpatient care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Alectinib continuation during COVID 19 'antiviral' treatment: Risk or benefit?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY PHARMACY PRACTICE
AB  - Introduction
   Serious Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) has led to COVID 19 pandemic a year ago and it has not been globally taken under control yet. COVID 19 tends to have poorer prognosis in cancer patients. Additionally, we have no well-established guidelines for management of these patients during pandemic, in terms of treatment of 'cancer' and treatment of 'COVID 19'. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are given without any break in cancer patients to have better survival outcomes in daily routine. However, there is no well-established data to continue or delay ALK inhibitors in lung cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV2. Concomittant use of ALK inhibitors and COVID 19 antiviral treatment is a dilemma because of the lack of data in this area.
   Case Report
   A 47-year old female metastatic ALK positive nonsquamous cell lung cancer patient on alectinib, a second generation ALK inhibitor was diagnosed with symptomatic COVID 19. She was given favipiravir for COVID 19 while continuing alectinib.
   Management and outcome: The patient continued alectinib during COVID 19 antiviral treatment without any break. She tolerated 'concomittant' alectinib & favipiravir. She had partial remission after three months of alectinib without any dose adjustment despite active COVID 19 medication.
   Discussion
   To best of our knowledge, this is the first case who continued alectinib without dose adjustment during antiviral COVID-19 medication without clinically worsening. There is limited data about 'concomittant' use of TKIs and antiviral COVID 19 medication in the literature. There are some case reports, but they generally tended to delay or suspend TKIs during COVID 19 antiviral medication. Our case differs from them in terms of continuation of alectinib without any break or additional side effects during favipiravir for symptomatic COVID 19. We consider that our case might contribute to the literature in terms of management of cancer patients on targeted therapy during COVID 19 antiviral treatment. However, clinical trials are needed in this area.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of antivirals against novel coronavirus (COVID-19): A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The unprecedented challenge faced by mankind due to emergence of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has obligated researchers across the globe to develop effective medicine for prevention and treatment of this deadly infection. The aim of this review is to compile recently published research articles on anti-COVID 19 management with their benefits and risk to facilitate decision making of the practitioners and policy makers. Unfortunately, clinical outcomes reported for antivirals are not consistent. Initial favorable reports on lopinavir/ritonavir contradicted by recent studies. Ostalmovir has conflicting reports. Short term therapy of remdesivir claimed to be beneficial. Favipiravir demonstrated good recovery in some of the cases of COVID-19. Umifenovir (Arbidol) was associated with reduction in mortality in few studies. Overall, until now, U.S. Food and Drug administration issued only emergency use authorization to remdesivir for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease.

TI  - Main protease inhibitors and drug surface hotspots for the treatment of COVID-19: A drug repurposing and molecular docking approach
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Here, drug repurposing and molecular docking were employed to screen approved MPP inhibitors and their derivatives to suggest a specific therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19. The approved MPP inhibitors against HIV and HCV were prioritized, while RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor remdesivir including Favipiravir, alpha-ketoamide were studied as control groups. The target drug surface hotspot was also investigated through the molecular docking technique. Molecular dynamics was performed to determine the binding stability of docked complexes. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion analysis was conducted to understand the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness of the screened MPP inhibitors. The results of the study revealed that Paritaprevir (-10.9 kcal/mol) and its analog (CID 131982844) (-16.3 kcal/mol) showed better binding affinity than the approved MPP inhibitors compared in this study, including remdesivir, Favipiravir, and alpha-ketoamide. A comparative study among the screened putative MPP inhibitors revealed that the amino acids T25, T26, H41, M49, L141, N142, G143, C145, H164, M165, E166, D187, R188, and Q189 are at potentially critical positions for being surface hotspots in the MPP of SARS-CoV-2. The top 5 predicted drugs (Paritaprevir, Glecaprevir, Nelfinavir, and Lopinavir) and the topmost analog showed conformational stability in the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 MP protein. The study also suggested that Paritaprevir and its analog (CID 131982844) might be effective against SARS-CoV-2. The current findings are limited to in silico analysis and lack in vivo efficacy testing; thus, we strongly recommend a quick assessment of Paritaprevir and its analog (CID 131982844) in a clinical trial.

TI  - FLUOXETINE USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED SURVIVAL OF PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 PNEUMONIA: A RETROSPECTIVE CASE-CONTROL STUDY
T2  - IDEGGYOGYASZATI SZEMLE-CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background and purpose - We aimed to investigate the association between fluoxetine use and the survival of hospitalised coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia patients.
   Methods - This retrospective case-control study used data extracted from the medical records of adult patients hospitalised with moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia at the Uzsoki Teaching Hospital of the Semmelweis University in Budapest, Hungary between 17 March and 22 April 2021. As a part of standard medical treatment, patients received anti-COVID-19 therapies as favipiravir, remdesivir, baricitinib or a combination of these drugs; and 110 of them received 20 mg fluoxetine capsules once daily as an adjuvant medication. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between fluoxetine use and mortality. For excluding a fluoxetine-selection bias potentially influencing our results, we compared baseline prognostic markers in the two groups treated versus not treated with fluoxetine.
   Results - Out of the 269 participants, 205 (76.2%) survived and 64 (23.8%) died between days 2 and 28 after hospitalisation. Greater age (OR [95% CI] 1.08 [1.05-1.11], p<0.001), radiographic severity based on chest X-ray (OR [95% CI] 2.03 [1.27-3.25], p=0.003) and higher score of shortened National Early Warning Score (sNEWS) (OR [95% CI] 1.20 [1.01-1.43], p=0.04) were associated with higher mortality. Fluoxetine use was associated with an important (70%) decrease of mortality (OR [95% CI] 0.33 [0.16-0.68], p=0.002) compared to the non-fluoxetine group. Age, gender, LDH, CRP, and D-dimer levels, sNEWS, Chest X-ray score did not show statistical difference between the fluoxetine and non-fluoxetine groups supporting the reliability of our finding.
   Conclusion - Provisional to confirmation in randomised controlled studies, fluoxetine may be a potent treatment increasing the survival for COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI  - Angiotensin (1-7) peptide replacement therapy with plasma transfusion in COVID-19
T2  - TRANSFUSION AND APHERESIS SCIENCE
AB  - Aim: To determine whether convalescent angiotensin (1-7) peptide replacement therapy with plasma (peptide plasma) transfusion can be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.Study design: Case series of 9 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment. Peptide plasma: Plasma with angiotensin (1-7) content 8-10 times higher than healthy plasma donors was obtained from suitable donors. Peptide plasma transfusion was applied to 9 patients whose clinical status and/or laboratory profile deteriorated and who needed intensive care for 2 days.Results: In our COVID-19 cases, favipiravir, low molecular weight heparin treatment, which is included in the treatment protocol of the ministry of health, was started. Nine patients with oxygen saturation of 93% and below despite nasal oxygen support, whose clinical and/or laboratory deteriorated, were identified. The youngest of the cases was 36 years old, and the oldest patient was 85 years old. 6 of the 9 cases had male gender. 3 cases had been smoking for more than 10 years. 4 cases had at least one chronic disease. In all of our cases, SARS CoV2 lung involvement was bilateral and peptide plasma therapy was administered in cases when oxygen saturation was 93% and below despite nasal oxygen support of 5 liters/minute and above, and intensive care was required. Although it was not reflected in the laboratory parameters in the early period, 8 patients whose saturations improved with treatment were discharged without the need for intensive care. However, a similar response was not obtained in one case. Oxygen requirement increased gradually and, he died in intensive care process. An increase of the platelet count was observed in all cases following the peptide plasma treatment.Conclusion: In this preliminary case series of 9 critically ill patients with COVID-19, administration of plasma containing angiotensin (1-7) was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these ob-servations require evaluation in clinical trials.

TI  - Comparison of remdesivir and favipiravir-the anti-Covid-19 agents mimicking purine RNA constituents
T2  - BIOMEDICAL PAPERS-OLOMOUC
AB  - By December 2019, humanity was challenged by a new infectious respiratory disease named coronavirus disease of 2019 or COVID-19. This is a viral infection based on the presence of the previously non-problematic coronavirus with assigned number 2. This virus causes severe acute respiratory distress and is known now as SARS-CoV2. Since SARSCoV2 is an RNA virus, remdesivir and favipiravir, both broad-spectrum RNA polymerase inhibitors, were repurposed for treating COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir and favipiravir are antimetabolites, and they are structurally related to the naturally occurring structural elements of RNA. Both agents are prodrugs and must be activated intracellularly to exert their effects through numerous and different mechanisms of action. Efforts have been exerted to determine their efficacy and safety against COVID-19 through clinical trials. Clinical trials have shown an association of remdesivir with increased frequency of adverse effects (in comparison to favipiravir). Nevertheless, the data obtained with remdesivir resulted in its approval by the FDA on the 22nd of October 2020 for COVID-19 treatment. At present, remdesivir is being recommended by several treatment guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The evidence in favor of favipiravir is compromised by the small number and low-quality of trials conducted. Favipiravir has shown various benefits when administered in mild and moderate cases of COVID-19, while remdesivir was more beneficial in more severe cases of the disease. Since the two agents are suitable for different groups of patients, both drugs can play a significant role in fighting this pandemic. The goal of this work is to summarize the information available on two antimetabolites - remdesivir and favipiravir - and to compare clinical experience obtained so far with these two agents in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Optical biometric measurements in patients with previous COVID-19 treatment
T2  - SPEKTRUM DER AUGENHEILKUNDE
AB  - Background We aimed to compare optical biometric measurements using optical biometry in patients with previously received COVID-19 treatment and a control group. Methods In this cross-sectional study, patients with previously received COVID-19 treatment formed the COVID-19 group and age- and sex-matched healthy participants formed the control group. Optical biometric measurements including keratometry, corneal astigmatism, astigmatic axis, central corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, and axial length were made using a Nidek optical biometer (AL-Scan; Nidek Co., Ltd., Japan). Results Measurements of keratometry (p = 0.79), corneal astigmatism (p = 0.41), axial length (p = 0.96), anterior chamber depth (p = 0.59), and central corneal thickness (p = 0.37) were similar between the COVID-19 and control groups. The astigmatic axis type taken from 2.4 mm of the cornea showed significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.02, chi(2)), while the measurements taken from 3.3 mm of the cornea were similar (p = 0.10, chi(2)). In the subgroup analysis, axial length, anterior chamber depth, and central corneal thickness measurements were found to be statistically significantly higher in male patients of the COVID-19 group (p = 0.02; p = 0.001; p = 0.02, t test). Conclusion The changes in optical biometric measurements found in our study were due to the fact that COVID-19 is more frequent and severe in males, SARS-CoV-2 can attach to the cornea via ACE-2 receptors, and favipiravir can reach the aqueous humor. To our knowledge, there is no study on this subject to date, and therefore more research is needed to shed light on this topic.

TI  - Lethal Mutagenesis of RNA Viruses and Approved Drugs with Antiviral Mutagenic Activity
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - In RNA viruses, a small increase in their mutation rates can be sufficient to exceed their threshold of viability. Lethal mutagenesis is a therapeutic strategy based on the use of mutagens, driving viral populations to extinction. Extinction catastrophe can be experimentally induced by promutagenic nucleosides in cell culture models. The loss of HIV infectivity has been observed after passage in 5-hydroxydeoxycytidine or 5,6-dihydro-5-aza-2 '-deoxycytidine while producing a two-fold increase in the viral mutation frequency. Among approved nucleoside analogs, experiments with polioviruses and other RNA viruses suggested that ribavirin can be mutagenic, although its mechanism of action is not clear. Favipiravir and molnupiravir exert an antiviral effect through lethal mutagenesis. Both drugs are broad-spectrum antiviral agents active against RNA viruses. Favipiravir incorporates into viral RNA, affecting the G -> A and C -> U transition rates. Molnupiravir (a prodrug of beta-d-N-4-hydroxycytidine) has been recently approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Its triphosphate derivative can be incorporated into viral RNA and extended by the coronavirus RNA polymerase. Incorrect base pairing and inefficient extension by the polymerase promote mutagenesis by increasing the G -> A and C -> U transition frequencies. Despite having remarkable antiviral action and resilience to drug resistance, carcinogenic risks and genotoxicity are important concerns limiting their extended use in antiviral therapy.

TI  - Effectiveness and Safety of Favipiravir Compared to Hydroxychloroquine for Management of Covid-19: A Retrospective Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease due to SARS-COV-2. Patients with risk factors are vulnerable to severe morbidity and mortality. Favipiravir (FPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are considered possible COVID-19 treatments.
   Objective: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of FPV compared to HCQ in patients with COVID-19 as the standard of care approved by the national protocol there.
   Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study on patients with COVID-19 who were administered either FPV or HCQ at King Faisal Medical Complex, Taif, Saudi Arabia, from June 2020 to August 2020.
   Results: In total, 508 patients were included in the analysis. Patients were categorized into three groups by medication. Patients enrolled in this study were 244 (55.8%) on FPV, 193 (44.2%) on HCQ and 71 (13.81%) on neither medication. Patients who received FPV had higher age and greater comorbidity. Most of the patients were discharged on day 14 (n = 303, 59.6%), 26 (36.6%) in neither med, 154 (63.1%) in FPV and 123 (63.7%) in HCQ groups with significant difference between groups (P < 0.0001). Mortality rate was 8.2% (n = 20) in FPV and 7.3% (n = 14) in HCQ groups with significant difference between groups (P = 0.048). Regarding drug safety, 19.7% of patients treated with FPV vs 7.8% HCQ have adverse effects with significant difference between groups (P < 0.0001). Most of the side effects were increase ALT and AST. Meanwhile, prolonged Q-T interval was reported only in the HCQ group (2.6%). From Cox regression modeling, only mechanical ventilation due to Covid 19 was predictive for mortality (HR: 16.598, 95% CI: 7.095-38.828, P < 0.0001). Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in the prediction of discharge of FPV (vs HCQ) (HR: 0.933, 95% CI: 0.729-1.195, P = 0.5843), predictors of mortality were HCQ (vs FPV) (HR: 2.3, 95% CI: 0.994-5.487, P = 0.0518). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed improved survival time and discharged time among patients in the HCQ versus FPV group with an insignificant difference between them (P = 0.85, P = 0.06, respectively).
   Conclusion: The present study concluded that FPV and HCQ showed comparable efficacy in decrease mortality and oxygen requirements. FPV likely has a more favorable safety profile regarding cardiac toxicity. A randomized clinical trial with large patient numbers is recommended to confirm the effectiveness of these drugs in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Molecular Docking Reveals Ivermectin and Remdesivir as Potential Repurposed Drugs Against SARS-CoV-2
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus that causes a respiratory disease with variable severity and fatal consequences. It was first reported in Wuhan and subsequently caused a global pandemic. The viral spike protein binds with the ACE-2 cell surface receptor for entry, while TMPRSS2 triggers its membrane fusion. In addition, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3 '-5 ' exoribonuclease (nsp14), viral proteases, N, and M proteins are important in different stages of viral replication. Accordingly, they are attractive targets for different antiviral therapeutic agents. Although many antiviral agents have been used in different clinical trials and included in different treatment protocols, the mode of action against SARS-CoV-2 is still not fully understood. Different potential repurposed drugs, including, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, remdesivir, and favipiravir, were screened in the present study. Molecular docking of these drugs with different SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, including spike and membrane proteins, RdRp, nucleoproteins, viral proteases, and nsp14, was performed. Moreover, the binding affinities of the human ACE-2 receptor and TMPRSS2 to the different drugs were evaluated. Molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA calculation were also conducted. Ivermectin and remdesivir were found to be the most promising drugs. Our results suggest that both these drugs utilize different mechanisms at the entry and post-entry stages and could be considered potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication.

TI  - Sudden bilateral vision loss in a COVID-19 patient: A case report
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB  - We present a Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient who developed sudden bilateral vision loss after a bilateral occipital ischemic stroke and without a history of stroke risk factors. An 84-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with bilateral sudden vision loss while receiving Favipiravir treatment for 5 days following a COVID-19 diagnosis. The patient had no history of stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, or arrhythmia. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of the patient revealed acute ischemia in the bilateral posterior occipital lobe and bilateral cerebellar hemisphere. We conclude that COVID-19 may rarely cause bilateral ischemic stroke presented only in the form of vision loss.

T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB  - A model of a multidomain complex is constructed using molecular modeling methods to explain the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of favipiravir on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. As the initial atomic coordinates, we use cryoelectron microscopy data for the apo form of RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and data on the structure of RdRp of the hepatitis C virus. After appropriate substitutions, an RdRp complex containing RNA chains and a potential enzyme inhibitor, favipiravir in the form of ribosatriphosphate, are constructed. The structure of the complex in aqueous shells, which includes more than 100 000 atoms, is optimized by molecular dynamics methods. Analysis of the active site with the incorporated favipiravir molecule makes it possible to explain the chemical reaction of the enzyme with the inhibitor.

TI  - Virological and genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from a favipiravir clinical trial cohort
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Introduction: Several clinical studies have reported the efficacy of favipiravir in reducing viral load and shortening the duration of symptoms. However, the viability of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of favipiravir therapy and the potential for resistance development is unclear. Methods: We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens collected from patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial of favipiravir at hospitals across Japan between March and May 2020. Paired genomes were sequenced from those who remained RT-PCR-positive 5-8 days into favipiravir therapy. Daily nasopharyngeal specimens from 69 patients who were RT-PCR-positive at randomization were examined for a cytopathic effect (CPE). Results: Some strains early in the trial belonged to clade 19 B, whereas the majority belonged to clade 20 B. The median time from the disease onset to negative CPE was 9 days. CPE was strongly correlated with the time from disease onset, viral load, age, and male sex. Among 23 patients for whom paired genomes were available, all except one had identical genomes. Two mutations were observed in one patient who received favipiravir, neither in the RdRp gene. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 genome distribution in this clinical trial conducted in Japan reflected the early influx of strains from China followed by replacement by strains from Europe. CPE was significantly associated with age, male sex, and viral loads but not with favipiravir therapy. There was no evidence of resistance development during favipiravir therapy.

TI  - Potential Drug Candidates in Clinical Trials for the Treatment of Covid-19: An Updated Overview
T2  - ORBITAL-THE ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB  - The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and by the end of April 2020, it spread to more than 200 countries worldwide. Particularly the USA, Brazil, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, Turkey, Iran, and Russia were the most affected countries till December 2020. Currently, most of the researchers are in a continuous struggle to develop a vaccine or new drugs to combat Covid-19. There are more than 30 drug candidates including Western medicines, natural products, and traditional Chinese medicines, that have shown to exhibit some efficacy against this highly infectious virus. This review encompasses the potential efficacy of some key drugs recently tested against Covid-19. With the rapid spread of Covid-19 reaching a new level every day, there is an immediate need to find safe and effective measures to diagnose, treat, mitigate, and combat the disease. Looking at the alarming dimensions that the disease is acquiring, treatment strategies among the different drug systems are being investigated. Currently, clinical management includes infection prevention, control measures, and supportive care, including supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation when indicated. The pharmaceutical interventions evaluated for the treatment of Covid-19 include human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, oseltamivir, favipiravir, carrimycin, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, thalidomide, vitamin C, pyrodfenidone, darthviravir, bromexistone, ryrexavir, lopinavir, xiyanping, and traditional Chinese medicine. But still, the researchers are struggling to discover the most effective drug for the treatment of the current pandemic of Covid-19.

TI  - Targeting Viral RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases as an Antiviral Therapy
T2  - CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Progressive globalization of our society brings not only worldwide integration, it also increases and promotes our exposure to new viral pathogens with evident impacts on our global health. Especially with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, our biomedical re-search infrastructure has never been more compelled to rapidly develop antiviral regimens that demonstrate improved efficacy against these pathogens. Here, we showcase 3 poign-ant antivirals against the lucrative target, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of RNA viruses - a timely and relevant topic given the present efforts against COVID-19. While effective drug designs against RdRP are important, their benefit and potential as a standard of care truly relies on them standing out in well-designed clinical trials.

TI  - The Anatomy of the SARS-CoV-2 Biomedical Literature: Introducing the CovidX Network Algorithm for Drug Repurposing Recommendation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the dire need to discover an antiviral drug, we explored the landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 biomedical publications to identify potential treatments.
   Objective: The aims of this study are to identify off-label drugs that may have benefits for the coronavirus disease pandemic, present a novel ranking algorithm called CovidX to recommend existing drugs for potential repurposing, and validate the literature-based outcome with drug knowledge available in clinical trials.
   Methods: To achieve such objectives, we applied natural language processing techniques to identify drugs and linked entities (eg, disease, gene, protein, chemical compounds). When such entities are linked, they form a map that can be further explored using network science tools. The CovidX algorithm was based upon a notion that we called "diversity." A diversity score for a given drug was calculated by measuring how "diverse" a drug is calculated using various biological entities (regardless of the cardinality of actual instances in each category). The algorithm validates the ranking and awards those drugs that are currently being investigated in open clinical trials. The rationale behind the open clinical trial is to provide a validating mechanism of the PubMed results. This ensures providing up to date evidence of the fast development of this disease.
   Results: From the analyzed biomedical literature, the algorithm identified 30 possible drug candidates for repurposing, ranked them accordingly, and validated the ranking outcomes against evidence from clinical trials. The top 10 candidates according to our algorithm are hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, chloroquine, ritonavir, losartan, remdesivir, favipiravir, methylprednisolone, rapamycin, and tilorone dihydrochloride.
   Conclusions: The ranking shows both consistency and promise in identifying drugs that can be repurposed. We believe, however, the full treatment to be a multifaceted, adjuvant approach where multiple drugs may need to be taken at the same time.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes and Plasma Concentrations of Baloxavir Marboxil and Favipiravir in COVID-19 Patients: An Exploratory Randomized, Controlled Trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 are still lacking. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes and plasma concentrations of baloxavir acid and favipiravir in COVID-19 patients.
   Methods: Favipiravir and baloxavir acid were evaluated for their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro before the trial initiation. We conducted an exploratory trial with 3 arms involving hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomized assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio into baloxavir marboxil group, favipiravir group, and control group. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects with viral negative by Day 14 and the time from randomization to clinical improvement. Virus load reduction, blood drug concentration and clinical presentation were also observed. The trial was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR 2000029544).
   Results: Baloxavir acid showed antiviral activity in vitro with the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 5.48 mu M comparable to arbidol and lopinavir, but favipiravir didn't demonstrate significant antiviral activity up to 100 mu M. Thirty patients were enrolled. The percentage of patients who turned viral negative after 14-day treatment was 70%, 77%, and 100% in the baloxavir marboxil, favipiravir, and control group respectively, with the medians of time from randomization to clinical improvement was 14, 14 and 15 days, respectively. One reason for the lack of virological effect and clinical benefits may be due to insufficient concentrations of these drugs relative to their antiviral activities. One of the limitations of this study is the time from symptom onset to randomization, especially in the baloxavir marboxil and control groups, which is higher than the favipiravir group.
   Conclusions: Our findings could not prove a benefit of addition of either baloxavir marboxil or favipiravir under the trial dosages to the existing standard treatment.

TI  - First electrochemical evaluation of favipiravir used as an antiviral option in the treatment of COVID-19: A study of its enhanced voltammetric determination in cationic surfactant media using a boron-doped diamond electrode
T2  - ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB  - Favipiravir, a promising antiviral agent, is undergoing clinical trials for the potential treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is the first report for the electrochemical activity of favipiravir and its electroanalytical sensing. For this purpose, the effect of cationic surfactant, CTAB was demonstrated on the enhanced accumulation of favipiravir at the surface of cathodically pretreated boron-doped diamond (CPT-BDD) electrode. At first, the electrochemical properties of favipiravir were investigated in the surfactant-free solutions by the means of cyclic voltammetry. The compound presented a single oxidation step which is irreversible and adsorption controlled. A systematic study of various operational conditions, such as electrode pretreatment, pH of the supporting electrolyte, concentration of CTAB, accumulation variables, and instrumental parameters on the adsorptive stripping response, was examined using square-wave voltammetry. An oxidation signal at around +1.21 V in Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 8.0 containing 6 x 10(-4) M CTAB allowed to the adsorptive stripping voltammetric determination of favipiravir (after 60 s accumulation step at open-circuit condition). The process could be used in the concentration range with two linear segments of 0.01-0.1 mg mL(-1) (6.4 x 10(-8-)6.4 x 10(-7) M) and 0.1-20.0 mg mL(-1) (6.4 x 10(-7)-1.3 x 10(-4) M). The limit of detection values were found to be 0.0028 mg mL(-1) (1.8 x 10(-8) M), and 0.023 mg mL(-1) (1.5 x 10(-7) M) for the first and second segments of calibration graph, respectively. The feasibility of developed methodology was tested to the analysis of the commercial tablet formulations and model human urine samples. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fully validated UPLC-MS/MS method for quantifying Favipiravir in human plasma boosted lean six sigma: An application for a bioequivalence study
T2  - BIOMEDICAL CHROMATOGRAPHY
AB  - This research developed and validated a highly sensitive and selective UPLC-MS/MS approach using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for quantifying favipiravir. Moreover, we introduced a study evaluating bioequivalence using two drugs, Favibrivix and Avigan, containing favipiravir. Lean Six Sigma verified the capacity and performance of the process. Protein precipitation extraction was utilized to extract favipiravir from the collected human matrices. We used an Acquity UPLCr BEH HILIC column and valproic acid as an internal standard. Furthermore, we conducted the procedure using an isocratic elution comprising acetonitrile and 0.005% ammonia in water (75:25, v/v), a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, a temperature controlled at 10 degrees C and an injection volume of 1.0 mu l. Our UPLC-MS/MS process has a broad range (50-10,000 ng/ml) with a determination coefficient of 0.9980. We validated the method in line with the US Food and Drug Administration. The findings revealed that the test, Favibrivix 200 mg/tablet, and the reference, Avigan (R) 200 mg/tablet, were statistically bioequivalent in healthy Egyptian participants.

TI  - Molecular docking studies of some selected gallic acid derivatives against five non-structural proteins of novel coronavirus
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENETIC ENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundThe World Health Organization has recently declared a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic and a global health emergency. The pressure to produce drugs and vaccines against the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the use of some drugs such as azithromycin, chloroquine (sulfate and phosphate), hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, favipiravir, remdesivir, ribavirin, ivermectin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. However, reports from some of the clinical trials with these drugs have proved detrimental on some COVID-19 infected patients with side effects more of which cardiomyopathy, cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, macular retinopathy, and hepatotoxicity have been recently reported. Realizing the need for potent and harmless therapeutic compounds to combat COVID-19, we attempted in this study to find promising therapeutic compounds against the imminent threat of this virus. In this current study, 16 derivatives of gallic acid were docked against five selected non-structural proteins of SARS-COV-2 known to be a good target for finding small molecule inhibitors against the virus, namely, nsp3, nsp5, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14. All the protein crystal structures and 3D structures of the small molecules (16 gallic acid derivatives and 3 control drugs) were retrieved from the Protein database (PDB) and PubChem server respectively. The compounds with lower binding energy than the control drugs were selected and subjected to pharmacokinetics screening using AdmetSAR server.Results4-O-(6-galloylglucoside) gave binding energy values of -8.4, -6.8, -8.9, -9.1, and - 7.5kcal/mol against Mpro, nsp3, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp15 respectively. Based on the ADMET profile, 4-O-(6-galloylglucoside) was found to be metabolized by the liver and has a very high plasma protein binding.ConclusionThe result of this study revealed that 4-O-(6-galloylglucoside) could be a promising inhibitor against these SAR-Cov-2 proteins. However, there is still a need for further molecular dynamic simulation, in vivo and in vitro studies to support these findings.

TI  - Modeling the Binding Mechanism of Remdesivir, Favilavir, and Ribavirin to SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase
T2  - ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE
AB  - Recent efforts to repurpose drugs to combat COVID-19 have identified Remdesivir as a candidate. It acts on the RNA-dependent, RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a protein complex responsible for mediating replication of the virus's genome. However, its exact action mechanism, and that of other nucleotide analogue inhibitors, is not known. In this study, we examine at the molecular level the interaction of this drug and that of similar nucleotide analogue inhibitors, ribavirin and favilavir, by relying on atomistic molecular simulations and advanced sampling. By analyzing the binding free energies of these different drugs, it is found that all of them bind strongly at the active site. Surprisingly, however, ribavirin and favilavir do not bind the nucleotide on the complementary strand as effectively and seem to act by a different mechanism than remdesivir. Remdesivir exhibits similar binding interactions to the natural base adenine. Moreover, by analyzing remdesivir at downstream positions of the RNA, we also find that, consistent with a "delayed" termination mechanism, additional nucleotides can be incorporated after remdesivir is added, and its highly polar 1'-cyano group induces a set of conformational changes that can affect the normal RdRp complex function. By analyzing the fluctuations of residues that are altered by remdesivir binding, and comparing them to those induced by lethal point mutations, we find a possible secondary mechanism in which remdesivir destabilizes the protein complex and its interactions with the RNA strands.

TI  - Favipiravir May Acts as COVID-19 Main Protease PDB ID 6LU7 Inhibitor: Docking Analysis
T2  - BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH IN APPLIED CHEMISTRY
AB  - Coronavirus is well-known threat to the human being in the form of COVID-19. Virus replication may be controlled by inhibition of protease enzyme. Hence. ell known 13 antiviral drugs have been observed by docking analysis for understanding the binding pattern of drugs with COVID-19-main protease PDB ID: 6LU7 for any possibilities of protease inhibition. For docking analysis PyRx-Python Prescription 0.8 was used. This analysis reveals that the essential amino acids involed in binding of antiviral drugs to COVID-19 main protease PDB ID: 6LU7 are Glycine (Gly). Serine (SerbCysteine (Cys). Leucine (Leu). Asparagine (Asn). Glutamine (Gin). Glutamic acid (Glu) and Threonine (Thr). After docking analysis. it was observed that Favipiravir it maybe act as COVID-10 main protease inhibitor despite being vRNA polymerase inhibitor and may further be used in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Complete response in a frail patient with high-grade B-cell lymphoma to only one cycle of R-CHOP or to prolonged COVID-19?
T2  - SEMINARS IN ONCOLOGY
AB  - Background: COVID-19 infection increases mortality in hematological malignancies. In a large metaanalysis, patients aged 60 years and older had a significantly higher risk of death than patients under 60 years of age [1]. Furthermore, a high risk of death and reduced survival in patients receiving B cell depletion therapy with prolonged COVID-19 infection was reported in a recent study [2]. High-grade B-cell lymphomas are classified as morphologically aggressive lymphomas with the presence of a high mitotic index and Ki-67 proliferation rates. They demonstrate aggressive behavior clinically as well as morphologically, and COVID-19 infection is an important factor that increases mortality in these patients. Herein, we present an elderly patient with a diagnosis of high-grade B-cell lymphoma, in whom a complete response was observed after prolonged COVID-19 infection. Case summary: An 81-year-old female patient received her first cycle of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone) treatment after being diagnosed with high- grade B-cell lymphoma. After being discharged from the hospital, the patient was referred to the emergency department with complaints of fever and fatigue when she came for the second cycle of chemotherapy. Her COVID-19 PCR test was found positive. She was admitted to the infectious diseases service and favipiravir treatment was started. On the 24th day of hospitalization, it was decided to perform interim FDG-PET/CT (Fluorodeoxyglucose - Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography) scan at a time that her PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test was still positive. A complete metabolic response was detected in her imaging. On the 26th day, the PCR test became negative and the patient was transferred to the oncology service and received the second cycle of R-CHOP treatment. Conclusion: Our case emphasizes that antitumor effect could be seen in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection and a hematologic malignancy. It also highlights being alert to prolonged COVID-19 infection in patients receiving B-cell depletion therapy.

TI  - Japanese rapid/living recommendations on drug management for COVID-19
T2  - ACUTE MEDICINE & SURGERY
AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide since early 2020, and there are still no signs of resolution. The Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock (J-SSCG) 2020 Special Committee created the Japanese rapid/living recommendations on drug management for COVID-19 using the experience of creating the J-SSCGs. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to determine the certainty of the evidence and strength of the recommendations. The first edition of this guideline was released on 9 September, 2020, and this document is the revised edition (version 3.1) (released 30 March, 2021). Clinical questions (CQs) were set for the following seven drugs: favipiravir (CQ1), remdesivir (CQ2), hydroxychloroquine (CQ3), corticosteroids (CQ4), tocilizumab (CQ5), ciclesonide (CQ6), and anticoagulants (CQ7). Favipiravir is recommended for patients with mild COVID-19 not requiring supplemental oxygen (GRADE 2C); remdesivir for moderate COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2B). Hydroxychloroquine is not recommended for all COVID-19 patients (GRADE 1B). Corticosteroids are recommended for moderate COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 1B) and severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator management/intensive care (GRADE 1A); however, their use is not recommended for mild COVID-19 patients not requiring supplemental oxygen (GRADE 1B). Tocilizumab is recommended for moderate COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2B). Anticoagulant therapy is recommended for moderate COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization and severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator management/intensive care (GRADE 2C). We hope that these clinical practice guidelines will aid medical professionals involved in the care of COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Real-World Effectiveness and Optimal Dosage of Favipiravir for Treatment of COVID-19: Results from a Multicenter Observational Study in Thailand
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
AB  - Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum oral antiviral agent that shows in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Presently, data on the real-world effectiveness and optimal dosage of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 are limited. We conducted a retrospective observational study of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 at five tertiary care hospitals in Thailand. We reviewed patient charts to obtain all necessary data. Among 247 COVID-19 patients, 63 (23.0%) received >= 1 dose of favipiravir. Of these 63 patients, 61.9% were male with a median age of 48 years (range 22-85 years), 27.0% required an O-2 nasal cannula, 9.5% required non-invasive ventilation and/or high-flow O-2 therapy, and 6.4% required invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO. The median baseline NEWS2 score was 5 (0-16). The Day-7 clinical improvement rate [95%CI] was 66.7% [53.7-78.0%] in all patients, 92.5% [75.7-99.1%] in patients who did not require O-2 supplementation, and 47.2% [0.4-64.5%] in patients who required O-2 supplementation. No life-threatening adverse events were identified. The 28-day mortality rate was 4.8%. A multivariate analysis revealed three poor prognostic factors for Day-7 clinical improvement (odds ratio (95%CI); p-value): older age (0.94 (0.89-0.99); p = 0.04), a higher baseline NEWS2 score (0.64 (0.47-0.88); p = 0.006), and a lower favipiravir loading dose (<= 45 mg/kg/day) (0.04 (0.005-0.4); p = 0.006). In conclusion, our study reports the promising effectiveness of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 patients. In addition to older age and a high baseline NEWS2 score, a low loading dose of favipiravir (<= 45 mg/kg/day) was also identified as a poor prognostic factor for early clinical improvement. Further studies to explore the optimal dose and the optimal timing of drug initiation for favipiravir should be performed.

TI  - Survival and Biomarkers of COVID-19 Patients Treated with Remdesivir and Favipiravir in ICU during the Peak of Pandemic: A Single Center Study in Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Since the first detection of a cluster of COVID-19 patients in China in late 2019, it becomes a global concern due to its transmissibility and ability to progress patients in severe respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which need intensive care unit support for a long time. We observed the repurposing use of remdesivir and favipiravir whether considered as a therapeutic option or not through survival rate and changes in biomarker during 10-day treatment stay in ICU.
   The retrospective observational study in a tertiary care hospital dedicated to COVID-19 at Dhaka, Bangladesh was done at the peak of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The mortality rate, length of ICU stays and eight prognostic biomarkers of patients treated with remdesivir and favipiravir was observed as one of the first ever reported experience in Bangladesh.
   Among the critically ill patients in ICU, 26 (44.8%) died and 32 (55.2%) were cured during the study period and highest mean duration of stay in ICU was observed (14.33 days and 18.13 days) in FPV-treated patients. Mean of means for all biomarkers CRP (26.0) and d-Dimer (2.64) was recorded higher in favipiravir treated patients in death cases, but NLR, d-NLR, platelet, PLR was much higher in remdesivir treated patient of both death and improved cases. Though overall outcome variables between death and improved cases were not statistically significant (p<0.39)
   The severity of disease progression in critically ill COVID-19 patients in ICU depends on comorbidities and hyper-responsive inflammatory or immunological biomarkers to predict. Though the emergency use authorization and repurposing use of different antivirals are still on trial, but remdesivir and favipiravir revealed not much hope in improving prognostic biomarkers, survival rate and disease progression at the peak of pandemic in Bangladesh.

TI  - Virtual screening, ADME/Tox predictions and the drug repurposing concept for future use of old drugs against the COVID-19
T2  - LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - The new Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a serious infection in the respiratory tract called COVID-19. Structures of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (M-pro), responsible for the replication of the virus, have been solved and quickly made available, thus allowing the design of compounds that could interact with this protease and thus to prevent the progression of the disease by avoiding the viral peptide to be cleaved, so that smaller viral proteins can be released into the host's plasma. These structural data are extremely important for in silico design and development of compounds as well, being possible to quick and effectively identify potential inhibitors addressed to such enzyme's structure. Therefore, in order to identify potential inhibitors for M-pro, we used virtual screening approaches based with the structure of the enzyme and two compounds libraries, targeted to SARS-CoV-2, containing compounds with predicted activity against M-pro. In this way, we selected, through docking studies, the 100 top-ranked compounds, which followed to subsequent studies of pharmacokinetic and toxicity predictions. After all the simulations and predictions here performed, we obtained 10 top-ranked compounds that were again in silico analyzed inside the M-pro catalytic site, together some drugs that are being currently investigated for treatment of COVID-19. After proposing and analyzing the interaction modes of these compounds, we submitted one molecule then selected as template to a 2D similarity study in a database containing drugs approved by FDA and we have found and indicated Apixaban as a potential drug for future treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Repurposing Drugs for COVID-19: An Approach for Treatment in the Pandemic
T2  - ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE
AB  - Context . Drug repurposing is a relevant approach during the COVID-19 pandemic, because development of new drugs is time-consuming and costly, and the safety of new drugs is paramount. Drug repurposing focuses on researching new indications for existing drugs and can reduce the challenges faced in drug development.
   Objective . The current review intended to examine the current status of drugs being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment.
   Design . The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases to find abstracts of relevant articles in journals published from 2010 until May 16, 2020. The sources of data included Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. The search terms used included repositioning of drugs, repurposing of drugs and COVID-19 therapy, and SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
   Setting . The research team conducted this study at the Department of Pharmacology, Punjab University College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan; Mangalbare Hospital, Morang, Nepal; and Dr Iwamura Memorial Hospital, Bhaktapur, Nepal.
   Results . Repurposing of drugs from different pharmacological groups including antivirals like remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, arbidol, oseltamivir, penciclovir, favipiravir, ganciclovir, and ribavirin; other antibiotics like azithromycin, ivermectin, eravacycline, valrubicin, streptomycin, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, caspofungin, and colistin; and other agents like hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, tocilizumab, camostat, nafamostat, carfilzomib, interferon, aprepitant, and dexamethasone can be considered for COVID-19 therapy.
   Conclusions . Although current results are promising, limitations to drug repurposing, such as a low success rate and the possibility of adverse events, can't be overlooked. With continuous research and technical advancements, repurposing will no doubt provide a notable scientific contribution to innovation in drug development and pharmacotherapy practice for the treatment of new diseases or existing diseases in a new way.

TI  - Repurposing of potential antiviral drugs against RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 by computational approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The high incidences of COVID-19 cases are believed to be associated with high transmissibility rates, which emphasizes the need for the discovery of evidence-based antiviral therapies for curing the disease. The rationale of repurposing existing classes of antiviral small molecule therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 in-fection has been expected to accelerate the tedious and expensive drug development process. While Remdesivir has been recently approved to be the first treatment option for specific groups of COVID-19 patients, combinatory therapy with potential antiviral drugs may be necessary to enhance the efficacy in different populations. Hence, a comprehensive list of investigational antimicrobial drug compounds such as Favipiravir, Fidaxomicin, Galidesivir, GC376, Ribavirin, Rifabutin, and Umifenovir were computationally evaluated in this study. We performed in silico docking and molecular dynamics simulation on the selected small molecules against RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is one of the key target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, using AutoDock and GROMACS. Interestingly, our results revealed that the macrocyclic antibiotic, Fidaxomicin, possesses the highest binding affinity with the lowest energy value of -8.97 kcal/mol binding to the same active sites of RdRp. GC376, Rifabutin, Umifenovir and Remdesivir were identified as the next best compounds. Therefore, the above-mentioned compounds could be considered good leads for further preclinical and clinical experimentations as potentially efficient antiviral inhibitors for combination therapies against SARS-CoV-2.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Subtle structural differences of nucleotide analogs may impact SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and exoribonuclease activity
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - The rapid spread and public health impact of the novel SARS-CoV-2 variants that cause COVID-19 con-tinue to produce major global impacts and social distress. Several vaccines were developed in record time to prevent and limit the spread of the infection, thus playing a pivotal role in controlling the pandemic. Although the repurposing of available drugs attempts to provide therapies of immediate access against COVID-19, there is still a need for developing specific treatments for this disease. Remdesivir, molnupi-ravir and Paxlovid remain the only evidence-supported antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19 patients, and only in severe cases. To contribute on the search of potential Covid-19 therapeutic agents, we targeted the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the exoribonuclease (ExoN) following two strate-gies. First, we modeled and analyzed nucleoside analogs sofosbuvir, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, and molnupiravir at three key binding sites on the RdRp-ExoN complex. Second, we curated and virtually screened a database containing 517 nucleotide analogs in the same binding sites. Finally, we character-ized key interactions and pharmacophoric features presumably involved in viral replication halting at multiple sites. Our results highlight structural modifications that might lead to more potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors against an expansive range of variants and provide a collection of nucleotide analogs useful for screening campaigns.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Computational analyses of Fe-Chelation by thiofavipiravir
T2  - MAIN GROUP CHEMISTRY
AB  - Existence of iron (Fe) is important for cells of living systems; however, its level of magnitude for those patients infected by novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still a challenging issue. Therefore, such mechanism of function was investigated in this work by assistance of thiofavipiravir (TFav) compounds generated by the well-known favipiravir (Fav) drug used for medication of COVID-19 patents. To this aim, sulfur-substitutions of oxygen atoms of Fav were done and the obtained parent structures were prepared for participating in Fe-chelation function. The results indicated that the modes were suitable for running such Fe-chelation processes, in which favorability and strength the models were ranged in this order: 1O2S-Fe > 1S2S-Fe > 1O2O-Fe > 1S2O-Fe. As a consequence, such idea of sulfur-substitution of Fav drug for more appropriate favorability of participating in Fe-chelation processwas sensed by results of this work proposing 1O2S compound as the most favorable one for doing the function. Hence, information about capability of TFav compounds for participating in Fe-chelation processes were provided in this work regarding the challenging issue of Fe-chelation in medication of COVID-19 patients. All results of this work were obtained by performing computations using the density functional theory (DFT) approach

TI  - Predicted occurrence, ecotoxicological risk and environmentally acquired resistance of antiviral drugs associated with COVID-19 in environmental waters
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Antiviral drugs have been used to treat the ever-growing number of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Consequently, unprecedented amounts of such drug residues discharging into ambient waters raise concerns on the potential ecotoxicological effects to aquatic lives, as well as development of antiviral drug-resistance in wildlife. Here, we estimated the occurrence, fate and ecotoxicological risk of 11 therapeutic agents suggested as drugs for COVID-19 treatment and their 13 metabolites in wastewater and environmental waters, based on drug consumption, physical-chemical property, and ecotoxicological and pharmacological data for the drugs, with the aid of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling. Our results suggest that the removal efficiencies at conventional wastewater treatment plants will remain low (<20%) for half of the substances, and consequently, high drug residues (e.g. 7402 ng/L ribavirin, 4231 ng/L favipiravir, 730 ng/L lopinavir, 319 ng/L remdesivir; each combined for both unchanged forms and metabolites; and when each drug is administered to 100 patients out of 100,000 populations on a day) can be present in secondary effluents and persist in the environmental waters. Ecotoxicological risk in receiving river waters can be high (risk quotient >1) by a use of favipiravir, lopinavir, umifenovir and ritonavir, and medium (risk quotient >0.1) by a use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and ribavirin, while the risk will remain low (risk quotient <0.1) for dexamethasone and oseltamivir. The potential of wild animals acquiring antiviral drug resistance was estimated to be low. Our prediction suggests a pressing need for proper usage and waste management of antiviral drugs as well as for improving removal efficiencies of drug residues in wastewater.

T2  - TURKISH NEUROSURGERY
AB  - Central and peripheral nervous system involvement of COVID-19 has been reported in 25% of cases. COVID-19 is associated with encephalitis and most often presenting with confusion and disorientation, and mortality decreases with early diagnosis and treatment.The patient who was admitted with confusion and fever and found COVID-19 PCR positivity in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the nasopharyngeal swab is presented here. A 71-year-old female patient who underwent transsphenoidal pituitary tumor surgery 4 months ago, was in an acute confusional state with fluctuations in consciousness and agitation. It was suggested that bilateral temporal areas of the brain and paramedian region of the pons compatible with encephalitis in the T2 and FLAIR axial sections of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nasopharyngeal and CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR was studied since thorax CT was compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia and in both samples, PCR was found positive. Encephalitis for toxic and metabolic causes was excluded. In this case, COVID-19 encephalitis was treated with dual antiviral (favipiravir and acyclovir) and steroid therapy. The uniqueness of this case is not only the presence of a very few reported cases of both Nasopharyngeal and CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR positivity but also previous history of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery 4 months ago.

TI  - Comprehensive in silico screening of flavonoids against SARS-COV-2 main protease
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - In the current pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), computational drug discovery can play an essential role in finding potential therapeutic agents. Thanks to its anti-viral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties, sage (Salvia officinalis) is used in traditional medicine. In this study, drugs proposed against COVID-19, including Lopinavir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, and main flavonoids of sage, were docked favorably against novel coronavirus main protease. Molecular docking findings indicate that Rutin, Luteolin-7-glucoside, Apigenin, and Hispidulin make strong interactions with better binding affinity than selected commercial drugs in the study. But Rutin is the only flavonoid that makes strong hydrogen bond interactions with catalytic dyad and crucial M-pro residues and has more binding affinity than protease inhibitor PF-07321332 as an oral antiviral (PAXLOVID (TM)). Further analysis of Molecular Dynamics and MM-PBSA predicted that chosen ligands could form stable complexes with the main protease. Also, ADMET analysis shows that main flavonoids are expected to have appropriate pharmacokinetic and no toxic properties. The results of the in silico study suggest that Salvia officinalis as a rich source of potent anti-coronavirus flavonoids may play a significant role in counteracting the replication of SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Combination of QSAR, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation and MM-PBSA: analogues of lopinavir and favipiravir as potential drug candidates against COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - Pandemic COVID-19 infections have spread throughout the world. There is no effective treatment against this disease. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalyzes the replication of RNA from RNA and the main protease (M-pro) has a role in the processing of polyproteins that are translated from the RNA of SARS-CoV-2, and thus these two enzymes are strong candidates for targeting by anti-viral drugs. Small molecules such as lopinavir and favipiravir significantly inhibit the activity of M-pro and RdRp in vitro. Studies have shown that structurally modified lopinavir, favipiravir, and other similar compounds can inhibit COVID-19 main protease (M-pro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In this study, lopinavir and its structurally similar compounds were chosen to bind the main protease, and favipiravir was chosen to target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Molecular docking and the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) study revealed that the selected candidates have favorable binding affinity but less druggable properties. To improve the druggability, four structural analogues of lopinavir and one structural analogue of favipiravir was designed by structural modification. Molecular interaction analyses have displayed that lopinavir and favipiravir analogues interact with the active site residues of M-pro and RdRp, respectively. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties, medicinal chemistry profile, and physicochemical features were shown that all structurally modified analogues are less toxic and contain high druggable properties than the selected candidates. Subsequently, 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the top four docked complexes demonstrated that CID44271905, a lopinavir analogue, forms the most stable complex with the M-pro. Further MMPBSA analyses using the MD trajectories also confirmed the higher binding affinity of CID44271905 towards M-pro. In summary, this study demonstrates a new way to identify leads for novel anti-viral drugs against COVID-19.

TI  - Prospective Hybrid Molecules with Dual Anti-Viral and Anti-Thrombotic Activity Against the SARS- CoV-2 Infection and Its Associated Complications Employing in Silico Studies
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF KARAGANDA-CHEMISTRY
AB  - Covid-19, a SARS-CoV virus-based disease, was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Initially, it was considered just an infection of the respiratory system, but due to its transmittable nature, it was declared a pandemic. A variety of treatment options were implemented, including antivirals like remdesvir, favipiravir along with vitamins and antioxidants. Further investigations revealed that the Covid-19 infection results in thrombotic cardiovascular complications, which are the major concern for the increased mortality associated with this disease. This study investigates the in Silico design of hybrid molecules with antiviral and antithrombotic properties. A docking study was performed using Autodock Vina software, and binding energies of the designed compounds were determined for papain-like protease (PDB: 3E9S) and 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (PDB: 6LU7). The docked poses and amino acids interactions were verified using Biovia Discovery studio 4.5. The binding energies of all designed compounds were compared with the standards, Compound RL1 (2-(5-(3-carbamoyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methoxy)carbonyl)amino)(hydroxy)methyl)carbamoyl)phenyl acetate) and Compound FL2 (8-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxy 4-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxochroman-6-yl(2-(6-flouro-3-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrazine-2-carboxamido)-1-hydroxy-3phenylpropyl)carbamate) proved to be promising agents with strong binding interactions. Hybrid molecules that inhibit viral replication, possibly as transition state inhibitors, may be investigated further for use in the treatment of SARS-Co-V infection and its associated complications.

T2  - CASE REPORTS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Although a variety of existing drugs are being tested for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no efficacious treatment has been found so far, particularly for severe cases. We report successful recovery in an elderly patient with severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Despite administration of multiple antiviral drugs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, and favipiravir, the patient's condition did not improve. However, after administration of another antiviral drug, remdesivir, we were able to terminate invasive interventions, including ECMO, and subsequently obtained negative polymerase chain reaction results. Although further validation is needed, remdesivir might be effective in treating COVID-19.

TI  - Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in a Patient with COVID-19: The Window of Insulin Glargine U300
T2  - KLIMIK JOURNAL
AB  - Research on pharmacological therapies for the treatment and prevention of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited in patients with Type 2 Diabet e s Mellitus (T2DM). In this case, diabetes management of a 51-year-old male patient who was followed up and treated with COVID-19 diagnosis in the pandemic clinic is presented. While metformin (2000 mg/day) oral therapy was continued, insulin glargine U100 (IGlar100) was added to the treatment subcutaneously. In addition. enoxaparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin were started to be administered to the patient. During follow-up, respiratory distress and tachypnea (26 breaths/ min), high fever (38.3 degrees C), increased CRP (42 mg/dL). and decreased oxygen saturation (91%) were detected. Favipiravir was added to the treatment. and metformin was stopped due to possible lactic acidosis risk. Kilar300 treatment with more potency effect and lower risk of hypoglycaemia was initiated while Kilar100 was discontinued. In the follow-uRs, titration was provided with Kilar3(X) to keep fasting blood glucose between 100-140 mg/dL and postprandial one between 140-180 mg/dL. In the treatment for this purpose, a maximum 0134 units: day insulin was needed. Capillary blood sugar monitoring was revised every 12 hours and then once a day. As the infection was brought under control. the required dose of IGlar300 decreased to 14 units/day. After diabetes training with a video phonecall. he was discharged with metformin and IGlar300 may be effective against diabetes in the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, a significant contribution can be made both to the treatment safety of the patient in a glycemic sense and to the safety of contamination by reduced contact of health care professionals.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Method for Quantification of Favipiravir as COVID-19 Management in Spiked Human Plasma
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - In the current work, a simple, economical, accurate, and precise HPLC method with UV detection was developed to quantify Favipiravir (FVIR) in spiked human plasma using acyclovir (ACVR) as an internal standard in the COVID-19 pandemic time. Both FVIR and ACVR were well separated and resolved on the C18 column using the mobile phase blend of methanol:acetonitrile:20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3.1) in an isocratic mode flow rate of 1 mL/min with a proportion of 30:10:60 %, v/v/v. The detector wavelength was set at 242 nm. Maximum recovery of FVIR and ACVR from plasma was obtained with dichloromethane (DCM) as extracting solvent. The calibration curve was found to be linear in the range of 3.1-60.0 mu g/mL with regression coefficient (r(2)) = 0.9976. However, with acceptable r(2), the calibration data's heteroscedasticity was observed, which was further reduced using weighted linear regression with weighting factor 1/x. Finally, the method was validated concerning sensitivity, accuracy (Inter and Intraday's % RE and RSD were 0.28, 0.65 and 1.00, 0.12 respectively), precision, recovery (89.99%, 89.09%, and 90.81% for LQC, MQC, and HQC, respectively), stability (% RSD for 30-day were 3.04 and 1.71 for LQC and HQC, respectively at -20 degrees C), and carry-over US-FDA guidance for Bioanalytical Method Validation for researchers in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Furthermore, there was no significant difference for selectivity when evaluated at LLOQ concentration of 3 mu g/mL of FVIR and relative to the blank.

TI  - A molecular docking study of EGCG and theaflavin digallate with the druggable targets of SARS-CoV-2
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - Background: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus called as SARS-CoV-2. This viral disease is known to infect the respiratory system, eventually leading to pneumonia. Crystallographic studies of the viral structure reveal its mechanism of infection as well as active binding sites and the druggable targets as scope for treatment of COVID-19.
   Hypothesis: The role of tea polyphenols in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 was established in this study.
   Study design: Molecular docking interactions of tea polyphenols with some of the possible binding sites of SARSCoV-2 were performed.
   Materials and methods: From various studies on the SARS-CoV-2 reported in the literature, we chose possible drug targets (Chymotrypsin-like protease, RNA dependant RNA polymerase, Papain like protease, Spike RBD and ACE2 receptor with spike RBD) which are vital proteins. These receptors were docked against two tea polyphenols, Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from green tea and Theaflavin digallate (TF3) from black tea. These polyphenols have been previously reviewed for their antiviral activities, especially against single-stranded RNA viruses. Two antiviral drugs, Remdesivir and Favipiravir were studied for comparative docking results.
   Results: A comparative study of docking scores and the type of interactions of EGCG, TF3 with the possible targets of COVID-19 showed that the tea polyphenols had good docking scores with significant in-silico activity.
   Conclusion: These results can provide a lead in exploring both the tea polyphenols in prophylaxis as well as treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Gender differences in treatment of Coronavirus Disease-2019
T2  - MONALDI ARCHIVES FOR CHEST DISEASE
AB  - Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is the worst worldwide pandemic with more than 12,000,000 cases and 560,000 deaths until 14th July 2020. Men were more infected by COVID-19 than women, and male subjects with underlying conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases developed a severe form of the affection, with increased mortality rate. Many factors can contribute to the disparity in disease outcomes, such as hormone-specific reaction and activity of X-linked genes, which modulate the innate and adaptive immune response to virus infection. Until now, only the Remdesivir was approved by FDA (Food Drug Administration) for COVID-19 treatment, although several clinical trials are ongoing worldwide also on other drugs. In this review, we analyzed published studies on several drugs (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir-ritonavir in combination, tocilizumab, plasma, and immunoglobulins) with some efficacy to COVID- 19 in humans, and evaluated if there were a gender analysis of the available data. In our opinion, it is essential to report data about COVID-19 disaggregated by sex, age, and race, because the knowledge of gender differences is fundamental to identify effective and customized treatments to reduce hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care units, and mortality.

TI  - Effects of Vitamin C on the Oral-Masai Mucosal Damage Caused by Favipiravir in Old and Young Rats
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background
   Favipiravir was widely used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) early in the pandemic. Later, many reports began to be published about the side effects of favipiravir on different tissues. However, the side effects of favipiravir on the oral and nasal mucosa remain unknown. This experimental study aimed to evaluate the pathological effects of favipiravir on the oral-nasal mucosa and investigate whether vitamin C (Vit C) reduces these lesions in old and young rats.
   Methodology
   A total of 100 rats were used for this study. The rats were administered favipiravir (20 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg) and Vit C (150 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. At the end of the study, rats were euthanatized, and oral-nasal mucosal histopathological changes were evaluated. Nuclear factor kappa-ligand (RANKL) and caspase-3 expressions were immunohistochemically examined.
   Results
   Favipiravir caused severe lesions in old rats compared to young, and the severity of the lesions increased with the dosage. Severe hyperemia and erosive-ulcerative lesions were observed in the oral-nasal mucosa. In addition, increased RANKL and caspase-3 expressions were observed in a dose-dependent manner. In both young and old groups, Vit C treatment showed decreased caspase-3 and RANKL expression; a more prominent decrease was seen in young rats.
   Conclusions
   This study showed that favipiravir could cause histopathological lesions in the oral and nasal mucosa. However, the administration of Vit C with favipiravir can provide a protective effect against this damage. The curative effect of Vit C was more pronounced in young rats and at low doses.

TI  - The Drug Repurposing for COVID-19 Clinical Trials Provide Very Effective Therapeutic Combinations: Lessons Learned From Major Clinical Studies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the globe in no time. In the beginning, people suffered due to the absence of efficacious drugs required to treat severely ill patients. Nevertheless, still, there are no established therapeutic molecules against the SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, repurposing of the drugs started against SARS-CoV-2, due to which several drugs were approved for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This paper reviewed the treatment regime for COVID-19 through drug repurposing from December 8, 2019 (the day when WHO recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic) until today. We have reviewed all the clinical trials from RECOVERY trials, ACTT-1 and ACTT-2 study group, and other major clinical trial platforms published in highly reputed journals such as NEJM, Lancet, etc. In addition to single-molecule therapy, several combination therapies were also evaluated to understand the treatment of COVID-19 from these significant clinical trials. To date, several lessons have been learned on the therapeutic outcomes for COVID-19. The paper also outlines the experiences gained during the repurposing of therapeutic molecules (hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir/ lopinavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, ivermectin, dexamethasone, camostatmesylate, and heparin), immunotherapeutic molecules (tocilizumab, mavrilimumab, baricitinib, and interferons), combination therapy, and convalescent plasma therapy to treat COVID-19 patients. We summarized that anti-viral therapeutic (remdesivir) and immunotherapeutic (tocilizumab, dexamethasone, and baricitinib) therapy showed some beneficial outcomes. Until March 2021, 4952 clinical trials have been registered in toward the drug and vaccine development for COVID-19. More than 100 countries have participated in contributing to these clinical trials. Other than the registered clinical trials (medium to large-size), several small-size clinical trials have also been conducted from time to time to evaluate the treatment of COVID-19. Four molecules showed beneficial therapeutic to treat COVID-19 patients. The short-term repurposing of the existing drug may provide a successful outcome for COVID-19 patients. Therefore, more clinical trials can be initiated using potential anti-viral molecules by evaluating in different phases of clinical trials.

TI  - Development and validation of a sensitive, fast and simple LC-MS/MS method for the quantitation of favipiravir in human serum
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. It is currently used as a possible treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pre-clinical or clinical trials of favipiravir require robust, sensitive, and accurate bioanalytical methods for quantitation of favipiravir levels. Recently, several studies have been reported about developing a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for measuring favipiravir levels. However, these methods were validated predominantly for plasma samples, electrospray ionization was operated only in negative or positive mode, and clinical application of these methods has not been applied for patients with COVID-19. This study aimed was to develop a validated LC-MS/MS method for the measurement of favipiravir levels in positive and negative electrospray ionization mode and to perform a pilot study in patients with COVID-19 receiving favipiravir to demonstrate the applicability of this method in biological samples. Simple protein precipitation was used for the extraction of favipiravir from the desired matrix. Favipiravir levels were quantitated using MS / MS with an electrospray ionization source in positive and negative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The chromatographic detection was performed on a reverse-phase Phenomenex C18 column (50 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mu m, 100 angstrom) with gradient elution using 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in methanol as mobile phase. The method was linear over the concentration ranges of 0.048-50 mu g/mL (in negative ionization mode) and 0.062-50 mu g/mL (in positive ionization mode) with a correlation coefficient (r2) better than 0.998. The total run time was 3.5 min. The intra-assay and inter-assay % CV values were less than 7.2% and 8.0%, respectively. A simple, rapid and robust LC-MS / MS method was developed for the measurement of favipiravir and validation studies were performed. The validated method was successfully applied for drug level measurement in COVID-19 patients receiving favipiravir.

TI  - Evaluation of the Costs and Outcomes of COVID-19 Therapeutic Regimens in Hospitalized Patients in Shiraz
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTION A-SCIENCE
AB  - COVID-19 patients in critical conditions are hospitalized and treated with various protocols including antiviral drugs, which have been updated repeatedly. This study was aimed to analyze the demographics, costs, and outcomes of drug regimens in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in "Ali Asghar" hospital, affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, from March 2019 to December 2020 as a retrospective study, approved by the ethics committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (IR.SUMS.REC.1399.1003) on Dec. 28, 2020. Using hospital information system (HIS) data, 2174 patients receiving favipiravir, remdesivir, interferon-beta, and Kaletra (R) were analyzed. Descriptive, univariate, and regression analyses were used. The costs and consequences of different drug regimens were significantly different (P value < 0.05); the highest and lowest costs belonged to remdesivir and Kaletra (R), respectively. The highest and lowest mean length of stay and mortality were related to remdesivir and favipiravir, respectively. Mortality did not differ significantly with various regimens. Length of stay was significantly shorter with favipiravir and Kaletra (R) than interferon-beta. Remdesivir had significantly the highest cost. Age presented a significantly positive relationship with mortality and length of stay. Besides, ICU admission significantly increased mortality, length of stay, and costs. Underlying diseases and low blood oxygen saturation contributed to mortality. COVID-19 correlation with age and underlying diseases is accordant with the published data. Given the highest costs and broad usage of remdesivir, besides controversies regarding its outcomes and side effects, a stricter evaluation of remdesivir benefits seems essential. Totally, COVID-19 therapeutic protocols should be selected carefully to optimize costs and outcomes.

TI  - Structure-based design and characterization of novel fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
AB  - The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has severely impacted the global public health and socio-economic stability, calling for effective vaccines and therapeutics. In this study, we continued our efforts to develop more efficient SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors and achieved significant findings. First, we found that the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike fusion protein plays a critical role in viral infectivity and can serve as an ideal template for design of fusion-inhibitory peptides. Second, a panel of novel lipopeptides was generated with greatly improved activity in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 fusion and infection. Third, we showed that the new inhibitors maintained the potent inhibitory activity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including those with the major mutations of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains circulating in the United Kingdom and South Africa, respectively. Fourth, the new inhibitors also cross-inhibited other human CoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. Fifth, the structural properties of the new inhibitors were characterized by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and crystallographic approach, which revealed the mechanisms underlying the high binding and inhibition. Combined, our studies provide important information for understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 fusion and a framework for the development of peptide therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs.

TI  - Immunogenicity of an mRNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccine among Adolescents with Obesity or Liver Transplants
T2  - VACCINES
AB  - There are limited data regarding the immunogenicity of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 among immunosuppressed or obese adolescents. We evaluated the humoral immune response in adolescents with obesity and adolescent liver transplant recipients (LTRs) after receiving two BNT162b2 doses. Sixty-eight participants (44 males; mean age 14.9 +/- 1.7 years), comprising 12 LTRs, 24 obese, and 32 healthy adolescents, were enrolled. Immunogenicity was evaluated by anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immunoassay and surrogate viral neutralization tests (sVNT) against the Delta and Omicron (BA.1) variants. At 27.1 +/- 3.2 days after the second dose, the antibody levels were 1476.6 +/- 1185.4, 2999.4 +/- 1725.9, and 4960.5 +/- 2644.1 IU/mL in the LTRs, obese adolescents, and controls, respectively (p < 0.001). Among obese individuals, liver stiffness <5.5 kPa was associated with higher antibody levels. The %inhibition of sVNT was significantly lower for the Omicron than that for the Delta variant. Injection site pain was the most common local adverse event. Nine participants (three obese and six controls) developed COVID-19 at 49 +/- 11 days after the second vaccination; four were treated with favipiravir. All infections were mild, and the patients recovered without any consequences. Our study supports the need for the booster regimen in groups with an inferior immunogenic response, including LTRs and obese individuals.

TI  - Characteristics and Management of Children with COVID-19 in Turkey
T2  - BALKAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Aims: Limited data about disease management strategies are available for pediatric patients with coronavirus disease-20I9. particularly in Turkey. This study aimed to share the data on patients aged under 18 years in our country to be beneficial for understanding the disease course in children.
   Methods: A retrospective review of the medical records of pediatric patients aged under 18 years who were confirmed as coronavirus disease-2019 between March 11, and June 23, 2020, and were admitted to our hospitals was conducted.
   Results: A total of 220 pediatric patients with coronavirus disease-2019 were evaluated, of which 48.2% were boys. with a median age of 10 years, and 9.5% had underlying diseases. Patients were classified according to severity. with the percentages of asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and criticaksevere cases determined to be 25.5%, 45%, 26.8%, and 2.7%, respectively. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required in two patients (0.9%) and mechanical ventilation in three (1.4%). Targeted therapies were used in six patients (2.7 degrees 0,. with hydroxychloroquine being the most commonly used agent either alone (one patient) or in combination with favipiravir (five patients). Two patients (0.9%) died, and nine (4.1%) were still hospitalized during the study period.
   Conclusion: Although the disease course of coronavirus disease-2019 seems to be mild in children, critical illness is significant, and the treatment strategy primarily should consist of supportive care according to our preliminary observations.

TI  - Biostructural Models for the Binding of Nucleoside Analogs to SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that requires an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for replication of its viral genome. Nucleoside analogs such as Remdesivir and beta-D-N-4-hydroxycytidine are antiviral candidates and may function as chain terminators or induce viral mutations, thus impairing RdRp function. Recently disclosed Cryo-EM structures of apo, RNA-bound, and inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV-2 RdRp provided insight into the inhibitor-bound structure by capturing the enzyme with its reaction product: Remdesivir covalently bound to the RNA primer strand. To gain a structural understanding of the binding of this and several other nucleoside analogs in the precatalytic state, molecular models were developed that predict the noncovalent interactions to a complex of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, RNA, and catalytic metal cations. MM-GBSA evaluation of these interactions is consistent with resistance-conferring mutations and existing structure-activity relationship (SAR) data. Therefore, this approach may yield insights into antiviral mechanisms and guide the development of experimental drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Remdesivir, lopinavir, emetine, and homoharringtonine inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro
T2  - ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH
AB  - An escalating pandemic by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is impacting global health and effective therapeutic options are urgently needed. We evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of compounds that were previously reported to inhibit coronavirus replication and compounds that are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 patients. We report the antiviral effect of remdesivir, lopinavir, homorringtonine, and emetine against SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells with the estimated 50% effective concentration at 23.15 mu M, 26.63 mu M, 2.55 mu M and 0.46 mu M, respectively. Ribavirin or favipiravir that are currently evaluated under clinical trials showed no inhibition at 100 mu M. Synergy between remdesivir and emetine was observed, and remdesivir at 6.25 mu M in combination with emetine at 0.195 mu M may achieve 64.9% inhibition in viral yield. Combinational therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration of compounds below the therapeutic plasma concentrations and provide better clinical benefits.

TI  - Repurposing of Drugs and HTS to Combat SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Utilizing Structure-Based Molecular Docking
T2  - LETTERS IN DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY
AB  - Background: COVID-19, first reported in China, from the new strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2), poses a great threat to the world by claiming uncountable lives. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious virus that has been spreading rapidly throughout the world. In the absence of any specific medicine to cure COVID-19, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics, including drug repositioning along with diagnostics and vaccines to combat the COVID-19. Many antivirals, antimalarials, antiparasitic, antibacterials, immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory agents are being clinically investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.
   Objectives: The earlier developed one parameter regression model correlating the dock scores with in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 main protease activity well predicted the six drugs viz remdesivir, chloroquine, favipiravir, ribavirin, penciclovir, and nitazoxanide as potential anti-COVID agents. To further validate our earlier model, the biological activity of nine more recently published SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors has been predicted using our previously reported model.
   Methods: In the present study, this regression model has been used to screen the existing antiviral, antiparasitic, antitubercular, and anti pneumonia chemotherapeutics utilizing dock score analyses to explore the potential including mechanism of action of these compounds in combating SARS-CoV-2 main protease.
   Results: The high correlation (R=0.91) explaining 82.3% variance between the experimental versus predicted activities for the nine compounds is observed. It proves the robustness of our developed model. Therefore, this robust model has been further improved, taking a total number of 15 compounds to formulate another model with an R-value of 0.887 and the explained variance of 78.6%. These models have been used for high throughput screening (HTS) of the 21 diverse compounds belonging to antiviral, antiparasitic, antitubercular, and anti pneumonia chemotherapeutics as potential repurpose agents to combat SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The models screened that the drugs bedaquiline and lefamulin have higher binding affinities (dock scores of -8.989 and -9.153 Kcal/mol respectively) than the reference compound {N}-[2-(5-fluoranyl-1 similar to{H}-indol-3-yl)ethyl]ethanamide (dock score of -7.998 Kcal/Mol), as well as higher predicted activities with pEC50 of 0.783 and 0.937 mu M and the 0.611 and 0.724 mu M respectively. The clinically used repurposed drugs dexamethasone and cefixime have been predicted with pEC50 values of -0.463 and -0.622 mu M and -0.311 and -0.428 mu M respectively for optimal inhibition. The drugs such as doxycycline, cefpodoxime, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, moxifloxacin, and TBAJ-876 showed moderate binding affinity corresponding to the moderate predicted activity (-1.540 to -1.109 mu M).
   Conclusion: In the present study, validation of our previously developed dock score-based one parametric regression model has been carried out by predicting 9 more SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors. Another model has been formulated to explore the model's robustness. These models have been taken as a barometer for the screening of more potent compounds. The HTS revealed that the drugs such as bedaquiline and lefamulin are highly predicted active compounds, whereas dexamethasone and cefixime have optimal inhibition towards SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The drugs such as doxycycline, cefpodoxime, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, moxifloxacin, and TBAJ-876 have moderately active compounds towards the target inhibition.

TI  - Early antiviral treatment in outpatients with COVID-19 (FLARE): a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Objectives: The objective of this trial is to assess whether early antiviral therapy in outpatients with COVID-19 with either favipiravir plus lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir alone, or favipiravir alone, is associated with a decrease in viral load of SARS-CoV-2 compared with placebo.
   Trial design: FLARE is a phase IIA randomised, double-blind, 2x2 factorial placebo-controlled, interventional trial.
   Participants: This trial is being conducted in the United Kingdom, with Royal Free Hospital, London as the lead site. Participants are non-hospitalised adults with highly suspected COVID-19 within the first 5 days of symptom onset, or who have tested positive with SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 within the first 7 days of symptom onset, or who are asymptomatic but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for the first time within the last 48 hours.Inclusion criteria are as follows: 1. Any adult with the following:
   Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 disease (Fever >37.8 degrees C on at least one occasion AND either cough and/ or anosmia) within the first 5 days of symptom onset (date/time of enrolment must be within the first 5 days of symptom onset)
   OR ANY symptoms compatible with COVID-19 disease (may include, but are not limited to fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise, myalgia, headache, coryza) and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the first 7 days of symptom onset) (date/time of enrolment must be within the first 7 days of symptom onset)
   OR no symptoms but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the last 48 hours (date/time of test must be within 48 hours of enrolment)
   2. Male or female aged 18 years to 70 years old inclusive at screening
   3. Willing and able to take daily saliva samples
   4. Able to provide full informed consent and willing to comply with trial-related procedures
   Exclusion criteria are as follows:
   1. Known hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients or excipients in favipiravir and matched placebo, and in lopinavir/ritonavir and matched placebo (See Appendix 2)
   2. Chronic liver disease at screening (known cirrhosis of any aetiology, chronic hepatitis (e.g. autoimmune, viral, steatohepatitis), cholangitis or any known elevation of liver aminotransferases with AST or ALT > 3 X ULN)*
   3. Chronic kidney disease (stage 3 or beyond) at screening: eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m(2) *
   4. HIV infection, if untreated, detectable viral load or on protease inhibitor therapy
   5. Any clinical condition which the investigator considers would make the participant unsuitable for the trial
   6. Concomitant medications known to interact with favipiravir and matched placebo, and with lopinavir/ritonavir and matched placebo, and carry risk of toxicity for the participant
   7. Current severe illness requiring hospitalisation
   8. Pregnancy and/ or breastfeeding
   9. Eligible female participants of childbearing potential and male participants with a partner of childbearing potential not willing to use highly effective contraceptive measures during the trial and within the time point specified following last trial treatment dose.
   10. Participants enrolled in any other interventional drug or vaccine trial (co-enrolment in observational studies is acceptable)
   11. Participants who have received the COVID-19 vaccine
   *Considering the importance of early treatment of COVID-19 to impact viral load, the absence of known chronic liver/kidney disease will be confirmed verbally by the participant during pre-screening and Screening/Baseline visit. Safety blood samples will be collected at Screening/Baseline visit (Day 1) and test results will be examined as soon as they become available and within 24 hours.

TI  - Favipiravir and/or nitazoxanide: a randomized, double-blind, 2x2 design, placebo-controlled trial of early therapy in COVID-19 in health workers, their household members, and patients treated at IMSS (FANTAZE)
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background: The 2020 pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is an unprecedented global emergency. COVID-19 appears to be a disease with an early phase where the virus replicates, coinciding with the first presentation of symptoms, followed by a later 'inflammatory' phase which results in severe disease in some individuals. It is known from other rapidly progressive infections such as sepsis and influenza that early treatment with antimicrobials is associated with a better outcome. The hypothesis is that this holds for COVID-19 and that early antiviral treatment may prevent progression to the later phase of the disease.
   Methods: Trial design: Phase IIA randomised, double-blind, 2 x 2 design, placebo-controlled, interventional trial. Randomisation: Participants will be randomised 1:1 by stratification, with the following factors: gender, obesity, symptomatic or asymptomatic, current smoking status presence or absence of comorbidity, and if the participant has or has not been vaccinated. Blinding: Participants and investigators will both be blinded to treatment allocation (double-blind).
   Discussion: We propose to conduct a proof-of-principle placebo-controlled clinical trial of favipiravir plus or minus nitazoxanide in health workers, their household members and patients treated at the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) facilities. Participants with or without symptomatic COVID-19 or who tested positive will be assigned to receive favipiravir plus nitazoxanide or favipiravir plus nitazoxanide placebo. The primary outcome will be the difference in the amount of virus ('viral load') in the upper respiratory tract after 5 days of therapy. Secondary outcomes will include hospitalization, major morbidity and mortality, pharmacokinetics, and impact of antiviral therapy on viral genetic mutation rate. If favipiravir with nitazoxanide demonstrates important antiviral effects without significant toxicity, there will be a strong case for a larger trial in people at high risk of hospitalization or intensive care admission, for example older patients and/or those with comorbidities and with early disease.

TI  - Clinical Features and Treatment of COVID-19
T2  - GAZI MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of clustered pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. The virus rapidly spread to the rest of the world after a huge epidemic in China and WHO has declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via respiratory droplets and fomites during close unprotected contact. The airborne spread has not been established as a major route of transmission. The mean incubation period of the illness is 5 days and it mainly presents with fever and respiratory symptoms. Myalgia, loss of taste and smell, diarrhea and dermatological findings are also common during the course of the disease. Laboratory findings are nonspecific. Significant elevations in inflammation markers can be observed in some patients due to cytokine storm. Typical CT findings are bilateral ground glass opacities and consolidation with peripheral and lower lobes distribution. COVID-19 causes mild symptoms in most cases, however it may progress to severe pneumonia leading to ARDS and death, especially in those with advanced age and comorbid diseases. There is no specific effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. A number of in vitro effective agents have been identified. These agents such as chloroquine phosphate/hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir are widely used in the treatment of the disease. Convalescent plasma therapy and the cytokine inhibitory agents such as tocilizumab, used to treat disease-induced cytokine storm, are particularly preferred in the treatment severe cases.

TI  - Targeting SARS-COV-2 non-structural protein 16: a virtual drug repurposing study
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - Non-Structural Protein 16 (nsp-16), a viral RNA methyltransferase (MTase), is one of the highly viable targets for drug discovery of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. In this study, drug discovery of SARS-CoV-2 nsp-16 has been performed by a virtual drug repurposing approach. First, drug shape-based screening (among FDA approved drugs) with a known template of MTase inhibitor, sinefungin was done and best compounds with high similarity scores were selected. In addition to the selected compounds, 4 nucleoside analogs of anti-viral (Raltgravir, Maraviroc and Favipiravir) and anti-inflammatory (Prednisolone) drugs were selected for further investigations. Then, binding energies and interaction modes were found by molecular docking approaches and compouds with lower energy were selected for further investigation. After that, Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried to test the potential selected compounds in a realistic environment. The results showed that Raltegravir and Maraviroc among other compounds can bind strongly to the active site of the protein compared to sinefungin, and can be potential candidates to inhibit NSP-16. Also, the MD simulation results suggested that the Maraviroc and Raltegravir are more effective drug candidates than Sinefungin for inhibiting the enzyme. It is concluded that Raltegravir and Maraviroc which may be used in the treatment of COVID-19 after Invitro and invivo studies and clinical trial for final confirmation of drug effectiveness.

TI  - Molecular Docking and Computational Exploration of Isolated Drugs from Daphne Species Against COVID-19
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING-INTERNATIONAL ENGLISH EDITION
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 has initiated in Wuhan city of China and then extend all around the world as a health emergency. It begins a new research area to produce potential drugs using data-driven approaches to identify potential therapies for the treatment of the virus. This is the time to develop specific antiviral drugs using molecular docking, quantum chemical approaches, and natural products. The protease inhibitors that constitute plant derivatives may become highly efficient to cure virus-prompted illnesses. A systematic study of isolated phytochemicals was executed then frontier molecular orbitals, docking score, molecular descriptors, and active sites were compared with favipiravir, dexamethasone, redeliver, and hydroxychloroquine which are being used against COVID19 nowadays. This is the first study on the phytochemicals of Daphne species to explore their anti-SARS-CoV-2 behavior by molecular docking and quantum chemical methods.

TI  - Clinical trials on drug repositioning for COVID-19 treatment
T2  - REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on December 2019 about a coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province (China). Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19. More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database. The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants' clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.

TI  - Natural Alkaloids as Potential Anti-Coronavirus Compounds
T2  - BEZMIALEM SCIENCE
AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are causative agents of the last three epidemics/pandemic; severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and the last one SARS-CoV-2. Although meta-analysis of treatment studies against these three CoVs found no clear benefit of any spesific regimen, currently, remdesivir and favipiravir are promising potential therapies for SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, since natural products have always played a crucial role in drug discovery and development process against various diseases, many groups in the world, are now trying to find new or repurposed natural or naturally originated drugs against viruses and CoVs. Secondary metabolites of the plants, particularly alkaloids and terpenoids have been exhibited strong antimicrobial and anticancer activities besides synthetic drugs and other natural compounds (nucleosides and nucleotides and bacterial and fungi originated ones). The first isolated secondary metabolites have been converted into important drugs since 1800's such as morphine, codeine, cocaine, and quinine have alkaloid skeleton as well as some of the recent anticancer drugs vinblastine, vincristine, taxol, etc. This review includes the last two decades of publications about natural alkaloids rather than their plant extracts which showed some promising results against CoVs. Marine organisms are also another rich source to discover new lead drugs, however they were excluded in the present review article.

TI  - In vitro CYTOTOXIC EFFECTS OF SOME COVID-19 DRUGS ON LUNG CANCER CELLS
T2  - TRAKYA UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF NATURAL SCIENCES
AB  - Cancer, which is the second most common cause of death after cardiovascular diseases, is one of the most important health problems of today. Discovery of effective treatments and drugs are important in cancer treatment. The COVID-19 epidemic, which broke out in Wuhan province of China in December 2019 and is considered as a pandemic worldwide, affected millions of people. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes this epidemic, affects the lungs, heart, brain, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, ovaries and testicles and various drugs are used in the treatment. In this study, we aimed to determine the cytotoxic effect of favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin, which are drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19, on human lung cancer cell line (A549). Favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin concentrations were prepared in doubly increasing doses (0.5-64 mu g/mL). The prepared concentrations were tested on human A549 cells. After 24 hours of incubation, the cytotoxic effects of the drugs on cancer cells were detected by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) method. The results were given as % viability. It was determined that favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin significantly decreased the cell viability in lung cancer cell line with increasing application doses (p<0.05).

TI  - Heterocyclic compounds as antiviral drugs: Synthesis, structure-activity relationship and traditional applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF HETEROCYCLIC CHEMISTRY
AB  - A virus outbreak challenges the economic, medical, and public health infrastructure worldwide. More than one virus capable of triggering diseases have been identified per year since 1972, which requires the development of new ways of treatment and prevention, however, such processes are not rapid and easy. With the pandemic scenario experienced since early 2020, several drugs with well-known purposes have gained prominence, due to speculation of their use in the treatment against the new coronavirus. Among the main drugs studied, the vast majority contain a heterocyclic structure. In this review, we presented the traditional and efficient synthesis of 15 drugs that have been studied for the COVID-19 treatment, containing in their structure heterocycles like indole, quinoline, pyrimidone, tetrahydrofuran, pyrrolidine, triazole, pyridazine, pyrazole, pyrrolopyrimidine, azetidine, pyrrolotriazine, pyrazine, tetrahydropyran, benzofuran, spiroketal, and thiazole. Furthermore, we have shown the original applications, as well as their structure-activity relationship and what is their situation as a drug candidate against COVID-19. Thus, the objective was to consolidate the main synthetic and pharmacological aspects involving clinically developed heterocycles that at some point were presented as promising against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Missing clinical trial data: the evidence gap in primary data for potential COVID-19 drugs
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background: Several drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic based on in vitro or early clinical findings. As these drugs are being used in varied regimens and dosages, it is important to enable synthesis of existing safety data from clinical trials. However, availability of safety information is limited by a lack of timely reporting of overall clinical trial results on public registries or through academic publication. We aimed to analyse the evidence gap in this data by conducting a rapid review of results posting on and in academic publications to quantify the number of trials missing results for drugs potentially being repurposed for COVID-19.
   Methods: was searched for 19 drugs that have been identified as potential treatments for COVID-19. Relevant clinical trials for any prior indication were listed by identifier (NCT number) and checked for results and for timely result reporting (within 395 days of the primary completion date). Additionally, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify publications of results not listed on the registry. A second, blinded search of 10% of trials was conducted to assess reviewer concordance.
   Results: Of 3754 completed trials, 1516 (40.4%) did not post results on or in the academic literature. Tabular results were available on for 1172 (31.2%) completed trials. A further 1066 (28.4%) had published results in the academic literature, but did not report results on . Key drugs missing clinical trial results include hydroxychloroquine (37.0% completed trials unreported), favipiravir (77.8%) and lopinavir (40.5%).
   Conclusions: There is an important evidence gap for the safety of drugs being repurposed for COVID-19. This uncertainty could cause unnecessary additional morbidity and mortality during the pandemic. We recommend caution in experimental drug use for non-severe disease and urge clinical trial sponsors to report missing results retrospectively.

TI  - Randomized controlled open label trial on the use of favipiravir combined with inhaled interferon beta-1b in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of favipiravir combined with inhaled interferon beta 1b in adult patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
   Methods: A randomized, open-label controlled trial of oral favipiravir in adults hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia from June 22nd 2020 to August 13th 2020 was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a combination of favipiravir with interferon beta-1b by inhalation aerosol or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The outcome endpoints included improvement in inflammatory markers, lower length of hospital stay (LOS), discharges and lower overall 14-day mortality.
   Results: A total of 89 patients underwent randomization with 49% (n = 44) assigned to favipiravir and 51% (n = 45) assigned HCQ. The overall mean age was 55 14 years and 58% (n = 52) were males. There were no significant differences in the inflammatory biomarkers at hospital discharge between the two groups; C-reactive protein (p = 0.413), ferritin (p = 0.968), lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.259) and interleukin 6 (p = 0.410). There were also no significant differences between the two groups with regards to the overall LOS (7 vs 7 days; p = 0.948), transfers to the ICU (18.2% vs 17.8%; p = 0.960), discharges (65.9% vs 68.9%; p = 0.764) and overall mortality (11.4% vs 13.3%; p = 0.778).
   Conclusions: No differences in clinical outcomes were found between favipiravir plus inhaled interferon beta-1b and hydroxychloroquine in adults hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI  - Future perspective: biologic agents in patients with severe COVID-19
T2  - IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY AND IMMUNOTOXICOLOGY
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 is a beta-CoV, which is enveloped by non-segmented positive-stranded RNA virus. When beta-CoV infects the respiratory tract, it can cause mild and/or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with consequent release of cytokines/mediators, including interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-10, IP10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, IL-33, IL-25, IL-37, IL-38, GCSF, GM-CSF, HGF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha (also known as CCL3), IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, TRAIL, MCSF, and TNF-alpha. Our hypothesis of writing this article can be summarized as; if the monoclonal antibody (mAb) administered by us does not inhibit the immune response for the beta-CoV and inhibits uncontrolled-adaptive/hyperimmune responses (also called cytokine storm) on endothelium level, then it may cause severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Anakinra is a human IL-1 receptor antagonist. By inhibiting IL-1 alpha/IL-1 beta competitively from binding to the IL-1 type-I receptor, anakinra, neutralizes the activity that pertains to these key mediators of autoinflammatory and/or immune processes. Tocilizumab is a blocker of IL-6R that can effectively block IL-6 signal transduction pathway. Omalizumab that binds to the CH3 domain is near to the binding site for the high-affinity IgE Fc receptors type-I of human IgE. Myocardial, lung and hepatorenal injury in patients with COVID-19 could be due to cytokine storm, hypoxic injury, or/and direct endothelial/vascular injury. We propose combination of mAbs with remdesivir and/or favipiravir in severe COVID-19 cases, such as septic shock, acute respiratory deficiency syndrome, and/or multiple organ failure. Finally, we highlight the therapeutic mAbs that target patients with severe COVID-19.

TI  - The therapeutic efficacy of quercetin in combination with antiviral drugs in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of quercetin in combination with remdesivir and favipiravir, were evaluated in severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our main objective was to assess the ability of quercetin for preventing the progression of the disease into critical phase, and reducing the levels of inflammatory markers related to SARS-Cov-2 pathogenesis. Through an open-label clinical trial, 60 severe cases were randomly divided into control and intervention groups. During a 7-day period, patients in the control group received antivirals, i.e., remdesivir or favipiravir, while the intervention group was treated with 1000 mg of quercetin daily in addition to the antiviral drugs. According to the results, taking quercetin was significantly associated with partial earlier discharge and reduced serum levels of ALP, q-CRP, and LDH in the intervention group. Furthermore, although the values were in normal range, the statistical outputs showed significant increase in hemoglobin level and respiratory rate in patients who were taking quercetin. Based on our observations, quercetin is safe and effective in lowering the serum levels of ALP, q-CRP, and LDH as critical markers involved in COVID-19 severity. However, according to the non-significant borderline results in comparing the mortality, the ICU-admission rate, and the duration of ICU-admission, further studies can be helpful to compensate the limitations of our study and clarify the therapeutic potential of quercetin in COVID-19 treatments.

TI  - Effectiveness and safety of favipiravir compared to supportive care in moderately to critically ill COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study with propensity score matching sensitivity analysis
T2  - CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION
AB  - Introduction Favipiravir is a repurposed drug to treat coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Due to a lack of available real-world data, we assessed its effectiveness and safety in moderately to critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods This retrospective study was conducted in two public/specialty hospitals in Saudi Arabia. We included patients >= 18 years) admitted April-August 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab. Patients received either favipiravir (1800 mg or 1600 mg twice daily loading dose, followed by 800 mg or 600 mg twice daily) or supportive-care treatment. Patients were excluded if they were outside the study period, classified as having a mild form of the disease per WHO criteria, or had an incomplete patient file. Kaplan-Meier (KM) models were used to estimate median time to discharge. Discharge ratios, progression to mechanical ventilation, and mortality outcomes were estimated across the severity spectrum using Cox proportional-hazards models. As a sensitivity analysis, we performed propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis. Results Overall, median time to discharge was 10 days (95%CI = 9-10) in the favipiravir arm versus 15 days (95%CI = 14-16) in the supportive-care arm. The accelerated discharge benefit was seen across the COVID-19 spectrum of severity. The adjusted discharge ratio was 1.96 (95%CI = 1.56-2.46). Progression to mechanical ventilation was slower with favipiravir (HRadj = 0.10, 95%CI = 0.04-0.29). There was no significant effect on mortality (HRadj = 1.56, 95%CI = 0.73-3.36). There was a statistically non-significant trend toward worse outcomes in the critical category (HRadj = 2.80, 95%CI = 0.99-7.89). Age was an independent risk factor for mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. PSM analyses confirmed these findings. Conclusion Favipiravir was associated with clinical benefits, including accelerated discharge rate and less progression to mechanical ventilation; however, no overall mortality benefits were seen across the severity spectrum.

TI  - Kidney Transplantation and COVID-19: Two Case Reports
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
AB  - Immunocompromised populations are at great risk of the current 2020 global emergency of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and treatment of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 is currently not declared. Hence, the purpose of the study is to set a clear treatment regimen. We report here a therapeutic course of 2 patients who underwent transplant surgery in March 2020 and got infected soon after. Since the transplant, these 2 patients have received triple maintenance immunosuppressive therapy with oral tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisone, and they have been regularly followed up at our hospital. The tacrolimus trough level was between 10 and 12 ng/mL. After the diagnosis of COVID-19, MMF was stopped and the tacrolimus dose was reduced so that blood level was between 4 and 6 ng/mL. The first patient was a 30-year-old man who, despite being treated with hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, oseltamivir, and azithromycin therapy, died because of the presence of other comorbidities. The second case was a 58-year-old man who fully recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia with treatment with methylprednisolone, MMF, azithromycin, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, and reduction in immunosuppression dosage. This reflects the importance of using glucocorticoids in the treatment of COVID-19 along with other medications and the decreased mortality rate associated with their use.

TI  - A systematic review on treatment-related mucocutaneous reactions in COVID-19 patients
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC THERAPY
AB  - Most of drugs could have certain mucocutaneous reactions and COVID-19 drugs are not an exception that we focused. We systematically reviewed databases until August 15, 2020 and among initial 851 articles, 30 articles entered this study (20 case reports, 4 cohorts, and 6 controlled clinical trials). The types of reactions included AGEP, morbiliform drug eruptions, vasculitis, DRESS syndrome, urticarial vasculitis, and so on. The treatments have been used before side effects occur, included: antimalarial, anti-viral, antibiotics, tocilizumab, enoxaparin and and so on. In pandemic, we found 0.004% to 4.15% of definite drug-induced mucocutaneous reactions. The interval between drug usage and the eruption varied about few hours to 1 month; tightly dependent to the type of drug and hydroxychloroqine seems to be the drug with highest mean interval. Antivirals, antimalarials, azithromycin, and tocilizumab are most responsive drugs for adverse drug reactions, but antivirals especially in combination with antimalarial drugs are in the first step. Types of skin reactions are usually morbilliform/exanthematous maculopapular rashes or urticarial eruptions, which mostly may manage by steroids during few days. In the setting of HCQ, specific reactions like AGEP should be considered. Lopinavir/ritonavir is the most prevalent used drug among antivirals with the highest skin adverse reaction; ribarivin and remdisivir also could induce cutaneous drug reactions but favipiravir has no or less adverse effects. Logically the rate of dermatologic adverse effects among anivirals may relate to their frequency of usage. Rarely, potentially life-threatening reactions may occur. Better management strategies could achieve by knowing more about drug-induced mucocutaneous presentations of COVID-19.

TI  - EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY OF FAVIPIRAVIR INFUSION IN PATIENTS HOSPITALIZED WITH COVID-19
T2  - PHARMACY & PHARMACOLOGY-FARMATSIYA I FARMAKOLOGIYA
AB  - Research in the development of new therapeutic agents with a wide spectrum of the antiviral activity and a low ability to develop resistance remains the main dimension in combating the global threat to public health. The need for a parenteral form of favipiravir was dictated by the necessity to increase the efficacy of therapy in COVID-19 inpatients. This dosage form has expanded the possibilities of drug therapy in the inpatients, for whom a therapeutic effect acceleration and a high safety profile of the drugs used are especially important. The aim of the article is the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of a medicinal product containing favipiravir for the paren-teral administration against the background of pathogenetic and symptomatic therapy, in comparison with standard therapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods. An open, randomized, multicenter comparative study was conducted in 6 research centers in the Russian Federation to evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir, a lyophilisate for the preparation of a concentrate for the infusion solution administrated to the patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Screening procedures and randomization were completed in 217 patients, 209 of which had completed the study in accordance with the protocol. Results. Between the study groups, statistically significant differences have been found out, making it possible to consider the hypothesis of the drug Areplivir (favipiravir) superiority for the parenteral administration over the standard therapy, which included favipiravir (p. o.) and remdesivir. A comparative analysis has shown that a course of therapy with the paren-teral favipiravir drug leads to a significant improvement in the condition of patients with COVID-19, significant benefits in terms of the speed and frequency of improvement in the clinical status of patients, as well as a reduction in the hospital stay length. It has been proven that therapy with a drug containing favipiravir for the parenteral administration does not adversely affect the parameters of clinical and biochemical blood tests, urinalysis, coagulograms, vital signs and ECG, which indicates the therapy safety. The study drug is characterized by a high safety profile and tolerability. Conclusion. The versatility and resistance to mutations of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase make it possible to consider it as the main target for combating the most common RNA viruses that cause ARVI, that determines the need further studies of favipiravir to expand the range of its indications

TI  - Evaluation of the Clinical and Laboratory Characteristics and Factors Determining the Severity of the Disease in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients
T2  - FLORA INFEKSIYON HASTALIKLARI VE KLINIK MIKROBIYOLOJI DERGISI
AB  - Introduction: Identification of high-risk patients in SARS-COV-2 infection and prompt initiation of treatment are essential to reduce mortality rate. In our study, it was aimed to evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who were hospitalized in our hospital and the factors that determine the severity of the disease.
   Materials and Methods: The files of definite/probable COVID-19 patients over the age of 18 who were followed by the Infectious Diseases Clink of our hospital between March 15 and November 1, 2020 were evaluated retrospectively.
   Results: A total of 302 patients were included in the study, 50.3% of the patients were males. Mean age of the patients participating in the study was 62.11 +/- 17.15 years. 51.3% of the patients are 65 years or older. The most common comorbidities in our patients were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. It was determined that lymphocyte count was below 800 in 22.5% of the patients. Involvement was detected on thorax CT in 88.7% of the patients, ground glass was observed in 95.8%. The most commonly used antiviral treatment in patients was favipiravir with 59.6%. Severe disease was present in 25.8% of all patients. In elderly patients with high comorbidities, COVID-19 was more severe, lymphopenia, hypofibrinogenemia and hypoproteinemia were more common in these patients, and there were significant differences in AST, D-dimer, ferritin, LDH, CRP, procalcitonin, troponin, PTZ and INR values in relation to the severity of the disease. Consolidation, infiltration and atelectasis in thorax CT were significantly higher in patients with severe disease. The average hospitalization period of the patients was 10.06 +/- 6.07 days, the rate of follow-up in the intensive care unit was 12.6%, and 5% of the patients died.
   Conclusion: Good identification of demographic clinical and laboratory prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 may contribute to physicians in the follow-up and treatment of the disease.

TI  - Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) with Special Reference to Pakistan: A Review on its Different Aspects
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
AB  - The novel coronavirus took the whole world by storm and in no time spread across the globe and claimed many lives. The most affected countries of the world are USA, Brazil, India, Italy, Iran, Spain, Russia, South Africa, United Kingdom and Peru. In Pakistan, the pilgrims from Iran became the major source of spread of the virus in the country, as the Government did not impose quarantine measures to restrict their movement. In Pakistan, the most affected province was Sindh followed by Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to WHO, the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, sore throat, fatigue and diarrhea and shortness of breath in severe cases. The virus attacks throat, lungs and trachea converting them to virus factories to infect more cells. It attacks not only lungs but also other vital organs of the body like kidneys and heart. It is spread from human to human through respiratory droplets or direct contact. Moreover, there have been reports of the mixed infection of coronavirus with other bacteria, fungi and viruses. Various methods are used for the detection of the virus such as nucleic acid and immunological methods but RT-PCR is considered as the most reliable. Some antiviral drugs have shown to be effective against the virus like Favilavir, Remdesivir, Chloroquine, hydroxy-chloroquine, Tocilizumab etc. but further clinical studies are required to confirm their efficacy. In Pakistan, blood plasma therapy is in high demand but involves the risk of transmission of blood borne pathogens. As Pakistan lacks medical facilities. the government has to get testing kits and primers from other countries. Only few quarantine centers are available and there is shortage of drugs, beds, trained doctors and paramedical staff. Unfortunately, no vaccine is available yet so the only management strategy is the prevention of infection by wearing masks and following social distancing. Cleanliness, hygiene and quarantine measures are the key to stop any epidemic to pandemic and is known to human being throughout the history and it becomes more critical when global travelling is a norm.

TI  - Human genetic risk of treatment with antiviral nucleoside analog drugs that induce lethal mutagenesis: The special case of molnupiravir
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS
AB  - This review considers antiviral nucleoside analog drugs, including ribavirin, favipiravir, and molnupiravir, which induce genome error catastrophe in SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 via lethal mutagenesis as a mode of action. In vitro data indicate that molnupiravir may be 100 times more potent as an antiviral agent than ribavirin or favipiravir. Molnupiravir has recently demonstrated efficacy in a phase 3 clinical trial. Because of its anticipated global use, its relative potency, and the reported in vitro "host" cell mutagenicity of its active principle, beta-d-N4-hydroxycytidine, we have reviewed the development of molnupiravir and its genotoxicity safety evaluation, as well as the genotoxicity profiles of three congeners, that is, ribavirin, favipiravir, and 5-(2-chloroethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine. We consider the potential genetic risks of molnupiravir on the basis of all available information and focus on the need for additional human genotoxicity data and follow-up in patients treated with molnupiravir and similar drugs. Such human data are especially relevant for antiviral NAs that have the potential of permanently modifying the genomes of treated patients and/or causing human teratogenicity or embryotoxicity. We conclude that the results of preclinical genotoxicity studies and phase 1 human clinical safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics are critical components of drug safety assessments and sentinels of unanticipated adverse health effects. We provide our rationale for performing more thorough genotoxicity testing prior to and within phase 1 clinical trials, including human PIG-A and error corrected next generation sequencing (duplex sequencing) studies in DNA and mitochondrial DNA of patients treated with antiviral NAs that induce genome error catastrophe via lethal mutagenesis.

TI  - Coronavirus Precautions: Experience of High Volume Liver Transplant Institute
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB  - Background: To present the struggle of a high volume liver transplant center against coronavirus infectious disease-2019 pandemic.
   Methods: Between March 2020 and December 2020, the demographic and clinical data of staff and liver transplant candidates diagnosed with coronavirus infectious disease-2019 in our Liver Transplant Institute were prospectively analyzed.
   Results: First, 32 healthcare staff were diagnosed with coronavirus infectious disease-2019, and 6 of them were surgeons. Six staff were asymptomatic, while 24 staff had mild or moderate and 2 staff had severe coronavirus infectious disease-2019. All the staff recovered from the disease without any permanent sequela and returned to duty after 2 consecutive negative polymerase chain reaction results within 24-hour intervals. Second, during the preoperative investigation, 6 living liver donor candidates and 13 recipients were tested positive for coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (son = 6, unrelated = 3, cousin = 3, daughter = 2, cadaveric = 1). Eleven patients received favipiravir and 8 did not receive any treatment because they were asymptomatic. Only one recipient who had severe coronavirus infectious disease-2019 died due to multiple organ failure syndrome. One recipient died in the early postoperative period. The median duration from the initial diagnosis of the patients till the transplant procedure was 21-days (min-max: 14-105 days). During the time of operation, the polymerase chain reaction tests of the donors and the recipients were negative, and the thorax tomography images showed no signs of viral pneumonia.
   Conclusion: Meticulous precautions, multidisciplinary approach, team effort, and organization of facilities can increase the quality of care of these patients in the coronavirus infectious disease-2019 era. Healthcare workers have shown tremendous effort and are the true heroes of this era.

TI  - Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes of patients with COVID-19 at Thailand's university-based referral hospital
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundThe epidemiology and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Thailand are scarce.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included adult hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Siriraj Hospital during February 2020 to April 2020.ResultsThe prevalence of COVID-19 was 7.5% (107 COVID-19 patients) among 1409 patients who underwent RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection at our hospital during the outbreak period. Patients with COVID-19 presented with symptoms in 94.4%. Among the 104 patients who were treated with antiviral medications, 78 (75%) received 2-drug regimen (lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir plus chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine), and 26 (25%) received a 3-drug regimen with favipiravir added to the 2-drug regimen. Disease progression was observed in 18 patients (16.8%). All patients with COVID-19 were discharged alive.ConclusionsThe prevalence of COVID-19 was 7.5% among patients who underwent RT-PCR testing, and 10% among those having risk factors for COVID-19 acquisition. Combination antiviral therapies for COVID-19 patients were well-tolerated and produced a favorable outcome.

TI  - A Cell-Based Reporter Assay for Screening Inhibitors of MERS Coronavirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are emerging zoonotic diseases caused by coronavirus (CoV) infections. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has been suggested as a valuable target for antiviral therapeutics because the sequence homology of CoV RdRp is highly conserved. We established a cell-based reporter assay for MERS-CoV RdRp activity to test viral polymerase inhibitors. The cell-based reporter system was composed of the bicistronic reporter construct and the MERS-CoV nsp12 plasmid construct. Among the tested nine viral polymerase inhibitors, ribavirin, sofosbuvir, favipiravir, lamivudine, zidovudine, valacyclovir, vidarabine, dasabuvir, and remdesivir, only remdesivir exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition. Meanwhile, the Z-factor and Z '-factor of this assay for screening inhibitors of MERS-CoV RdRp activity were 0.778 and 0.782, respectively. Ribavirin and favipiravir did not inhibit the MERS-CoV RdRp activity, and non-nucleoside HCV RdRp inhibitor, dasabuvir, partially inhibited MERS-CoV RdRp activity. Taken together, the cell-based reporter assay for MERS-CoV RdRp activity confirmed remdesivir as a direct inhibitor of MERS-CoV RdRp in cells. A cell-based MERS-CoV RdRp activity reporter assay is reliable and accurate for screening MERS-CoV RdRp-specific inhibitors. It may provide a valuable platform for developing antiviral drugs for emerging CoV infections.

TI  - Investigation of developmental toxicity of favipiravir on fetal bone and embryonic development
T2  - BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH
AB  - Background Favipiravir is one of the essential antiviral drugs used for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in some countries. However, there is not enough information about used, especially in pregnancy. Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to determine the developmental toxicity of favipiravir on fetal bone development and embryonic development. Methods In this study, 16 pregnant wistar albino rats were used. The rats were divided into four groups: Control (saline) and Group A (50 mg/kg x 5 days), Group B (50 mg/kg x 1 days + 20 mg/kg x 4 days), Group C (20 mg/kg x 5 days). Solutions were administered to the rats by oral gavage from the 10th to 14th days of pregnancy, twice a day. The skeletal system development of fetuses was examined with double skeletal staining and immunohistochemical staining methods. Results A total of 72 fetuses from pregnant rats, 18 in each group, were included in the study. As a result, depending on favipiravir dose increase, in experimental groups, it was determined that the statistically significant decrease on the ossification rates of anterior and posterior extremity bones, and length and weight of fetuses. Conclusion Exposure to favipiravir during pregnancy impairs bone metabolism and bone formation-resorption stages and may cause developmental delay.

TI  - Current pharmacological treatments for COVID-19: What's next?
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Since December 2019 SARS-Cov-2 was found responsible for the disease COVID-19, which has spread worldwide. No specific therapies/vaccines are yet available for the treatment of COVID-19. Drug repositioning may offer a strategy and a number of drugs have been repurposed, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab. This paper describes the main pharmacological properties of such drugs administered to patients with COVID-19, focusing on their antiviral, immune-modulatory and/or anti-inflammatory actions. Where available, data from clinical trials involving patients with COVID-19 are reported. Preliminary clinical trials seem to support their benefit. However, such drugs in COVID-19 patients have peculiar safety profiles. Thus, adequate clinical trials are necessary for these compounds. Nevertheless, while waiting for effective preventive measures i.e. vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway. Their results will help us in defining the best way to treat COVID-19 and reducing its symptoms and complications.

TI  - Efficacy of the current investigational drugs for the treatment of COVID-19: a scoping review
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE
AB  - To date, there is no final FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19. There are thousands of studies published on the available treatments for COVID-19 virus in the past year. Therefore, it is crucial to synthesize and summarize the evidence from published studies on the safety and efficacy of experimental treatments of COVID-19. We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, GHL, OpenGrey, ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases through April 2020. We obtained 2699 studies from the initial literature search. Of them, we included 28 eligible studies that met our eligibility criteria. The sample size of the included studies is 2079 individuals. We extracted and pooled the available data and conducted a quality assessment for the eligible studies. From the 28 studies, only 13 studies provide strong evidence. Our results showed that Favipiravir and Hydroxycholoroquine shorten viral clearance and clinical recovery time and promote pneumonia absorption. On the other hand, Lopinavir-ritonavir either alone or combined with arbidol or interferons has no significant difference superior to the standard care. Corticosteroids, Convalescent plasma transfusion, and anticoagulant therapies provide a better prognosis. Remedsivir, Tocilizumab, Immunoglobulin, Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation showed effective treatment results, but further confirmatory studies are needed. In conclusion, Favipiravir and Remedsivir might be promising drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

TI  - A Prospective, Randomized, Open-Label Trial of Early versus Late Favipiravir Therapy in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Favipiravir is an oral broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is approved for treatment of influenza in Japan. We conducted a prospective, randomized, open- label, multicenter trial of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 at 25 hospitals across Japan. Eligible patients were adolescents and adults admitted with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic or mildly ill and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to early or late favipiravir therapy (in the latter case, the same regimen starting on day 6 instead of day 1). The primary endpoint was viral clearance by day 6. The secondary endpoint was change in viral load by day 6. Exploratory endpoints included time to defervescence and resolution of symptoms. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 69 were virologically evaluable. Viral clearance occurred within 6 days in 66.7% and 56.1% of the early and late treatment groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.76 to 2.62). Of 30 patients who had a fever (>= 37.5 degrees C) on day 1, times to defervescence were 2.1 days and 3.2 days in the early and late treatment groups ( aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.81 to 4.35). During therapy, 84.1% developed transient hyperuricemia. Favipiravir did not significantly improve viral clearance as measured by reverse transcription-PCR (RT- PCR) by day 6 but was associated with numerical reduction in time to defervescence. Neither disease progression nor death occurred in any of the patients in either treatment group during the 28-day participation.

TI  - A hypothesis on designing strategy of effective RdRp inhibitors for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2
T2  - 3 BIOTECH
AB  - Vaccines are used as one of the major weapons for the eradication of pandemic. However, the rise of different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is creating doubts regarding the end of the pandemic. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop more drug candidates which can be useful for the treatment of COVID-19. In the present research for the scientific hypothesis, emphasis was given on the direct antiviral therapy available for the treatment of COVID-19. In lieu of this, the available molecular targets which include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Chymotrypsin-like Protease (SARS-3CLpro), Papain-Like Cysteine Protease (PLpro), and RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) were explored. As per the current scientific reports and literature, among all the available molecular targets, RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) was found to be a crucial molecular target for the treatment of COVID-19. Most of the inhibitors which are reported against this target consisted of the free amine group and carbonyl group which might be playing an important role in the binding interaction with the RdRp protein. Among all the reported RdRp inhibitors, remdesivir, favipiravir, and molnupiravir were found to be the most promising drugs against COVID-19. Overall, the structural features of this RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors proved the importance of pyrrolo-triazine and pyrimidine scaffolds. Previous computational models of these drug molecules indicated that substitution with the polar functional group, hydrogen bond donor, and electronegative atoms on these scaffolds may increase the activity against the RdRp protein. Hence, in line with the proposed hypothesis, in the present research work for the evaluation of the hypothesis, new molecules were designed from the pyrrolo-triazine and pyrimidine scaffolds. Further, molecular docking and MD simulation studies were performed with these designed molecules. All these designed molecules (DM-1, DM-2, and DM-3) showed the results as per the proposed hypothesis. Among all the designed molecules, DM-1 showed promising results against the RdRp protein of SARS-CoV-2. In the future, these structural features can be used for the development of new RdRp inhibitors with improved activity. Also, in the future lead compound DM-1 can be explored against the RdRp protein for the treatment of COVID-19.

T2  - CHEMICAL METHODOLOGIES
AB  - The crystal structure of quinoline derivative with empirical formula (C18H21N3O7) was determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which belongs to the monoclinic system with the P2(1)/c space group. The cohesion and stabilization of the structure were provided by C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bond and Van-Der Waals interactions. A molecular docking study was performed to determine its antiviral potency between the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M-pro) (PDB ID: 6Y2E) and chloroquine was chosen as a standard because of its similarity with our synthetic quinoline-based compound. Six herbal compounds and synthetic drugs bound to the active site of the target in order to compare their results with synthetic quinoline-based compound. This synthetic compound showed the lowest binding energy of -7.6 kcal.mol(-1), proving that this molecule seems to be a good candidate against the SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Novel Formulations of the Antiviral Drug Favipiravir: Improving Permeability and Tabletability
T2  - CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB  - Recently, favipiravir, as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, has gain more attention because it might be a candidate to remedy the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To improve its poor permeability and tabletability, four multicomponent crystals of favipiravir (FPV) were prepared by a slow evaporation or liquid-assisted grinding method, including three cocrystals (FPV-theophylline, 1:1; FPV-saccharin, 1:1; FPV-5-fluorouracil, 1:1) and one salt (FPV-piperazine, 2:1). All of the crystal structures were solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Interestingly, FPV-theophylline has a crystal structure similar to that of FPV, leading to similar properties, such as solubility, permeability, and tabletability. Except for FPV-theophylline, all of the other multicomponent crystals exhibit an enhanced permeability and tabletability. Our studies provide a new insight in overcoming the shortcomings of the important antiviral drug FPV.

TI  - Temperature-Responsive Multilayer Films Based on Block Copolymer-Coated Silica Nanoparticles for Long-Term Release of Favipiravir
T2  - ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB  - Using surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization, temperature-responsive block polymers were functionalized on the surface of silica nanocapsules (SNCs) by a "grafting-from" technique. Favipiravir, a potential medicine candidate for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), was encapsulated in polymer-coated SNCs and further incorporated into well-defined films by layer-by-layer self-assembly. The multilayer ilIms composed of polymer-coated SNCs and poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) homopolymers exhibited swelling/deswelling behaviors under the trigger of a temperature stimulus. For the first time, the impact of steric hindrance on the assembling behavior, swelling/deswelling transition, and delivering capacity of nanocapsule-based multilayer films was investigated. SNCs with coronae of higher steric hindrance resulted in a larger layering distance during film growth. Moreover, the difference in the sustained release rates of the drug indicated their diverse diffusion coefficients and intermolecular interactions within the multilayer films, due to the presence of a methyl spacer at the amino group of nanocapsule coronae and weaker ionic pairing between SNC coronae and PMAA homopolymers. The profile of drug release from the films was dependent on the temperature value of the surrounding environment. At 37 and 40 degrees C, the films were able to efficiently entrap favipiravir, with as low as 50% released in 80 days, whereas a faster favipiravir release was triggered by exposure to a lower temperature value at 25 degrees C. This work demonstrates the first proof-of-concept platform of temperature-responsive SNC-incorporated multilayered films with a well-defined internal structure and a sustained release profile for on-demand in vitro drug delivery.

TI  - Overview of clinical outcome and therapeutic effectiveness of Favipiravir in patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Prior to the availability of the current COVID-19 vaccine, the need to control the pandemic worldwide was focused on management of the disease using previously approved antivirals, including Favipiravir which inhibits viral replication through the RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme. Favipiravir's efficacy against different viral infections has made it a potential treatment for COVID-19. We are aiming in this study to assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treating critically ill patients admitted with COVID-19 to Intensive Care Units (ICUs).Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study was conducted in five tertiary hospitals in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The studied sample was randomized from a huge pool of data collected primarily for critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to (ICUs) during the period between April 2020 to March 2021. Two groups of patients matched 1: 1 for age and body mass index (BMI) was enrolled in the study; one group received Favipiravir and another comparison group received other antimicrobial medications, not including Favipiravir. Results: A total data of 538 COVID-19 patients were analyzed, 269 (50.%) received Favipiravir and 269 (50%) the control group received different treatments. More than two-thirds 201 (74.7%) were Saudi citizens, the majority 177 (65.8%) were males and the mean age and (BMI) were; (57.23 +/- 15.16) years and (31.61 +/- 7.33) kg/m2 respectively. The most frequent symptoms of presentation were shortness of breath (SOB), fever, and cough, and the most frequent comorbidity was diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease. In the supplemental therapy, corticosteroid, tocilizumab and chloroquine were statistically significant (P = 0.001) when combined in the FVP group more than in the comparison group. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was more frequent among Favipiravir group, while the overall mortality rate among the Favipiravir group was not statistically significant (p-value 0.4).Conclusion: According to the study's results revealing FVP is not superior to other antivirals, patients who received Favipiravir presented with more severe symptoms, more comorbidities, more complications, and is not effective in controlling the cytokine storm which negatively impact the efficacy of Favipiravir.FVP therapy had no influence on ICU and hospital length of stay in comparison with the control group as well as in the overall mortality rate among the FVP group was not statistically significant. further research is needed to understand how FVP along with other treatments can improve the length of stay among COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences.

TI  - Potential Drug Interaction Between Favipiravir and Warfarin in Patients With COVID-19: A Real-World Observational Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Favipiravir is one of the most used antiviral agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 infection in many countries, including Thailand. This study aimed to investigate the effect of favipiravir-warfarin interaction in terms of changes in international normalized ratio (INR) of patients. Medication charts of all inpatients in a hospital in Thailand between April 2021 and March 2022 were reviewed. Patients who received either warfarin with standard care or warfarin with favipiravir were included. The INR levels of patients were monitored at baseline and the earliest date following treatment, as well as other laboratory parameters. There were 43 and 53 patients in the warfarin-favipiravir and the warfarin-only groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics, such as sex, age, body mass index, and warfarin dose, were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The results showed that the mean INR of patients using favipiravir and warfarin was increased from 2.14 to 3.88 (P < .001), while the patients using warfarin alone had no increase in the mean INR (1.93 vs 1.91; P = .906). Other parameters were not significantly changed, including white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and liver function. However, an increase in platelet count was observed in the favipiravir-warfarin group, but not in the control group. This real-world study highlighted a significant increase in the INR levels of patients who used favipiravir together with warfarin, compared to patients who used only warfarin. However, the interaction did not affect other laboratory parameters, except an increase in platelet count.

TI  - Impact of Liver Functions by Repurposed Drugs for COVID-19 Treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL HEPATOLOGY
AB  - Liver injury is an important complication that may arise in patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is accompanied by a transient increase of transaminases and/or other liver enzymes. Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities generally disappear when the COVID-19 resolves or hepatotoxic drugs are discontinued. The LFT abnormalities are associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI), due to the overuse of antimalarials, antivirals, and antimicrobials. Studies have reported varying levels of these liver injuries in COVID-19 patients; however, most involve elevated serum aminotransferases. Hepatic dysfunction is significantly high in patients with severe illness and has poor outcome. Normally, the liver is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including nucleoside analogs and protease inhibitors, which are currently repurposed to treat COVID-19. In addition to the manifestation of COVID-19, drugs implemented in its treatment may aggravate liver injuries. Thus, DILI should be considered especially in those COVID-19 patients with underlying liver disease. It was unclear whether the elevated liver enzymes have originated from the underlying disease or DILI in this population. Furthermore, it is difficult to establish a direct relationship between a specific drug and liver injury. Another possible effect of liver damage may due to inflammatory cytokine storm in severe COVID-19. Liver injury can change metabolism, excretion, dosing, and expected concentrations of the drugs, which may make it difficult to achieve a therapeutic dose of the drug or increase the risk of adverse effects. These repurposed drugs have shown limited efficacy against the virus and the disease itself; however, they still pose risk of adverse effects. Careful and close monitoring of LFTs in COVID-19 patients can provide early diagnosis of liver injury, and the risk of DILI could be reduced. Also, drug interactions in liver-transplanted patients should always be kept in mind for certain immunosuppressive therapies and their known signs of DILI. Altogether, abnormal LFTs should not be regarded as a contraindication to use COVID-19 experimental therapies if needed under emergent status.

TI  - Variation in therapeutic strategies for the management of severe COVID-19 in India: A nationwide cross-sectional survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Aim During the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the physicians are using various off-label therapeutics to manage COVID-19. We undertook a cross-sectional survey to study the current variation in therapeutic strategies for managing severe COVID-19 in India. Methods From January 4 to January 18, 2021, an online cross-sectional survey was conducted among physicians involved in the management of severe COVID-19. The survey had three sections: 1. Antiviral agents, 2. Immunomodulators, and 3. Adjuvant therapies. Results 1055 respondents (from 24 states and five union territories), of which 64.2% were consultants, 54.3% working in private hospitals, and 39.1% were from critical care medicine completed the survey. Remdesivir (95.2%), antithrombotics (94.2%), corticosteroids (90.3%), vitamins (89.7%) and empirical antibiotics (85.6%) were the commonly used therapeutics. Ivermectin (33%), convalescent plasma (28.6%) and favipiravir (17.6%) were other antiviral agents used. Methylprednisolone (50.2%) and dexamethasone (44.1%) were preferred corticosteroids and at a dose equivalent of 8 mg of dexamethasone phosphate (70.2%). There was significant variation among physicians from different medical specialities in the use of favipiravir, corticosteroids, empirical antibiotics and vitamins. Conclusion There is a considerable variation in the physicians' choice of therapeutic strategies for the management of severe COVID-19 in India, as compared with the available evidence.

TI  - The inhibitory effect of some natural bioactive compounds against SARS-CoV-2 main protease: insights from molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamic simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
AB  - This work aimed at evaluating the inhibitory effect of ten natural bioactive compounds (1-10) as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2-3CL main protease (PDB ID: 6LU7) and SARS-CoV main proteases (PDB IDs: 2GTB and 3TNT) by molecular docking analysis. The inhibitory effect of all studied compounds was studied with compared to some proposed antiviral drugs which currently used in COVID-19 treatment such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, baloxvir, lopinavir, and favipiravir. Homology modeling and sequence alignment was computed to evaluate the similarity between the SARS-CoV-2-3CL main protease and other SARS-CoV receptors. ADMET properties of all studied compounds were computed and reported. Also, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was performed on the compound which has the highest binding affinity inside 6LU7 obtained from molecular docking analysis to study it is stability inside receptor in explicit water solvent. Based on molecular docking analysis, we found that caulerpin has the highest binding affinity inside all studied receptors compared to other bioactive compounds and studied drugs. Our homology modeling and sequence alignment showed that SARS-CoV main protease (PDB ID: 3TNT) shares high similarity with 3CLpro (96.00%). Also, ADMET properties confirmed that caulerpin obeys Lipinski's rule and passes ADMET property, which make it a promising compound to act as a new safe natural drug against SARS-CoV-2-3CL main protease. Finally, MD simulation confirmed that the complex formed between caulerpin and 3CLpro is stable in water explicit and had no major effect on the flexibility of the protein throughout the simulations and provided a suitable basis for our study. Also, binding free energy between caulerpin and 6LU7 confirmed the efficacy of the caulerpin molecule against SARS-CoV-2 main protease. So, this study suggested that caulerpin could be used as a potential candidate in COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Trivalent and pentavalent atoms doped boron nitride nanosheets as Favipiravir drug carriers for the treatment of COVID-19 using computational approaches
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - In our DFT investigations, pristine BNNS as well as trivalent and pentavalent atoms doped BNNS have been taken into consideration for Favipiravir (FPV) drug carriers for the treatment of COVID-19. Among the nanosheets, In doped BNNS (BN(In)NS) interacts with FPV by favorable adsorption energies about -2.44 and -2.38 eV in gas and water media respectively. The charge transfer analysis also predicted that a significant amount of charge about 0.202e and 0.27e are transferred to BN(In)NS in gas and water media respectively. HOMO and LUMO energies are greatly affected by the adsorption of FPV on BN(In)NS and energy gap drastically reduced by about 38.80 % and 64.07 % in gas and water media respectively. Similar results are found from the global indices and work function analysis. Therefore, it is clearly seen that dopant In atom greatly modified the BNNS and enhanced the adsorption behavior along with sensitivity, reactivity, polarity towards the FPV.

TI  - Overview of Targets and Potential Drugs of SARS-CoV-2 According to the Viral Replication
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
AB  - Since the novel coronavirus pandemic, people around the world have been touched in varying degrees, and this pandemic has raised a major global health concern. As there is no effective drug or vaccine, it is urgent to find therapeutic drugs that can serve to deal with the current epidemic situation in all countries and regions. We searched drugs and response measures for SARS-CoV-2 in the PubMed database, and then updated the potential targets and therapeutic drugs from the perspective of the viral replication cycle. The drug research studies of the viral replication cycle are predominantly focused on the process of the virus entering cells, proteases, and RdRp. The inhibitors of the virus entry to cells and RdRp, such as Arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, EIDD-2081, and ribavirin, are in clinical trials, while most of the protease inhibitors are mainly calculated by molecular docking technology, which needs in vivo and in vitro experiments to prove the effect for SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes the drugs targeting the viral replication process and provides a basis and directions for future drug development and reuse on the protein level of COVID-19.

TI  - A Chemical Approach on Drugs that are Under Evaluation as Potential COVID-19's Treatment
T2  - REVISTA VIRTUAL DE QUIMICA
AB  - A novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is a public health emergency of international concern since this infection spreads quickly through human-to-human transmission. Several drugs are being studied by researchers worldwide as an effective antiviral agent against this coronavirus. Therefore, most studies are focusing on drugs that have been already used earlier on the treatment of other diseases. Therapies under investigation include azithromycin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir. Remdesivir is the only Food and Drug Administrationapproved drug for the use in adult and pediatric patients (>12 years old) for the treatment of this disease requiring hospitalization. In this context, the present review summarizes information about these drugs highlighting the chemical standpoint, such as physical-chemical and molecular characteristics, toxicity, history, and main applications, since knowledge about these substances is essential to assist the search for an appropriate treatment.

TI  - Comprehensive Cardiotoxicity Assessment of COVID-19 Treatments Using Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread across the globe, with numerous clinical trials underway seeking to develop and test effective COVID-19 therapies, including remdesivir. Several ongoing studies have reported hydroxychloroquine-induced cardiotoxicity, including development of torsade de pointes (TdP). Meanwhile, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are expected to serve as a tool for assessing drug-induced cardiotoxicity, such as TdP and contraction impairment. However, the cardiotoxicity of COVID-19 treatments has not been fully assessed using hiPSC-CMs. In this study, we focused on drug repurposing with various modes of actions and examined the TdP risk associated with COVID-19 treatments using field potential using multi-electrode array system and motion analysis with hiPSC-CMs. Hydroxychloroquine induced early after depolarization, while remdesivir, favipiravir, camostat, and ivermectin had little effect on field potentials. We then analyzed electromechanical window, which is defined as the difference between field potential and contraction-relaxation durations. Hydroxychloroquine decreased electromechanical window of hiPSC-CMs in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, other drugs had little effect. Our data suggest that hydroxychloroquine has proarrhythmic risk and other drugs have low proarrhythmic risk. Thus, hiPSC-CMs represent a useful tool for assessing the comprehensive cardiotoxicity caused by COVID-19 treatments in nonclinical settings.

TI  - Treatment Options for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Coronavirus Disease 2019: a Review of Clinical Evidence
T2  - INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Coronaviruses have caused serious Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks, and only remdesivir has been recently indicated for the treatment of COVID-19. In the line of therapeutic options for SARS and MERS, this study aims to summarize the current clinical evidence of treatment options for COVID-19. In general, the combination of antibiotics, ribavirin, and corticosteroids was considered as a standard treatment for patients with SARS. The addition of this conventional treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon, and convalescent plasma showed potential clinical improvement. For patients with MERS, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon, and convalescent plasma were continuously recommended. However, a high-dose of corticosteroid was suggested for severe cases only. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma was commonly reported. There was limited evidence for the effect of corticosteroids, other antiviral drugs like ribavirin, and favipiravir. Monoclonal antibody of tocilizumab and antimalarial agents of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were also introduced. Among antibiotics for infection therapy, azithromycin was suggested. In conclusion, this study showed the up-to-date evidence of treatment options for COVID-19 that is helpful for the therapy selection and the development of further guidelines and recommendations. Updates of on-going clinical trials and observational studies may confirm the current findings.

TI  - Nanomaterials for Photocatalytic Degradations of Analgesic, Mucolytic and Anti-Biotic/Viral/Inflammatory Drugs Widely Used in Controlling SARS-CoV-2
T2  - CATALYSTS
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been transformed into one of the main worldwide challenges, in recent years. For controlling symptoms that are caused by this disease (e.g., chills or fever, shortness of breath and/or difficulty in breathing, cough, sore throat, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, the new loss of tastes and/or smells, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea), lots of medicines including analgesics, mucolytics, and anti-biotic/viral/inflammatory drugs have been frequently prescribed. As these medicines finally contaminate terrestrial and aquatic habitats by entering surface waterways through pharmaceutical production and excreting trace amounts of waste after human usage, they have negative impacts on wildlife's health and ecosystem. Residual drugs in water have the potential to harm aquatic creatures and disrupt their food chain as well as the breeding cycle. Therefore, proper degradation of these broadly used medicines is highly crucial. In this work, the use of nanomaterials applicable in photocatalytic degradations of analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen), mucolytics (e.g., ambroxol), antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin and quinolones including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate), anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone and cortisone acetate), antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine), H2 blockers (e.g., famotidine), anthelmintics (e.g., praziquantel), and finally antivirals (e.g., ivermectin, acyclovir, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, nitazoxanide, and remdesivir) which widely used in controlling/treating the coronavirus have been reviewed and discussed.

TI  - The effects of favipiravir on hematological parameters of covid-19 patients
T2  - REVISTA DA ASSOCIACAO MEDICA BRASILEIRA
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aims to evaluate changes in hematological parameters after the follow-up of patients who received treatment with favipiravir due to COVID-19 infections.
   METHODS: Sixty-two cases receiving favipiravir treatment for at least five days due to COVID-19 infection were evaluated retrospectively. Parameters including age, gender, nasopharyngeal swab positivity, and chronic diseases were analyzed. Hematologic parameters were analyzed before and after the treatment.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the patients receiving treatment with favipiravir was 63.7 +/- 12.3 years. Nasopharyngeal swab positivity was detected in 67.7%. The most common comorbid conditions detected in patients were hypertension in 25 cases (40.3%) and diabetes in 16 cases (25.8%). In the statistical analysis of the hematological parameters before and after treatment with favipiravir, WBC, PT-PTT-INR levels were found to be unaffected; the mean RBC was found to have decreased from 4.33 +/- 0.58 M/uL to 4.16 +/- 0.54 M/uL (p:0.003); the median hemoglobin level was found to have decreased from 12.3 g/dl to 11.9 g/dl (p:0.041); the hematocrit level decreased from 38.1% +/- 4.8 to 36.9% +/- 4.2 (p:0.026); the median neutrophil count decreased from 4.57 K/uL to 3.85 K/uL (p:0.001); the mean lymphocyte count increased from 1.22 +/- 0.53 K/uL to 1.84 +/- 1.79 K/uL (p:0.000); and the mean platelet count increased from 244.1 +/- 85.1 K/uL to 281.9 +/- 103.3 K/uL (p:0.005).
   CONCLUSION: We concluded that the pathological effect of treatment with favipiravir on the hematologic system was the suppression in the erythrocyte series, and there were no adverse effects in other hematologic parameters.

TI  - Fluorescence of ocular surface in a Covid-19 patient after Favipiravir treatment: a case report
T2  - VIROLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Background Favipiravir is used in treatment of Covid-19 patients. We aimed to share of ocular surface fluorescence in a patient after Favipiravir treatment in this case report. Case presentation A 20-year-old male patient declared no known systemic disease prior to Covid-19. He applied to us with blurry vision and blue light reflection after Covid-19 treatment with Favipiravir. We observed bilateral fluorescence on his eyes and fluorescence of his nails. Biomicroscopic examination was insignificant. Conclusion We investigated the fluorescence of favipiravir tablets under ultraviolet light. Drug demonstrated fluorescence. We recorded the favipiravir fluorescence in-vitro. This appears to be a strong evidence in terms of the linkage between the fluorescence of the ocular surface and favipiravir.

TI  - Favipiravir induces oxidative stress and genotoxicity in cardiac and skin cells
T2  - TOXICOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Favipiravir (T-705), used against influenza viruses, is approved for emergency use in many countries for the treatment of COVID-19. The frequent adverse effects of favipiravir are related with the gastrointestinal system, however, studies suggest a positive association of favipiravir on QTc prolongation, which can cause cardiotox-icity. Also, there are reports of skin reactions such as angioedema due to favipiravir. Despite the several adverse effects, studies examining the drug's effects at the molecular level are insufficient, e.g., the genotoxic and oxidative stress-inducing effects of favipiravir, which are among the primary mechanisms of drug-induced toxicity. The cytotoxicity of favipiravir was analyzed with the measurement of the ATP content in H9c2 car-diomyoblasts and CCD-1079Sk skin fibroblasts. The ATP level decreased starting from 200 mu M. The inhibitory effect on the mitochondrial electron transport chain enzymes complex I and complex V was also evaluated where favipiravir showed significant enzyme inhibitory effects in the highest concentration studied. A molecular docking study evaluating the interaction between favipiravir-RTP and mitochondrial DNA polymerase (POLG1) was done. The relationship of favipiravir with oxidative stress was examined by measuring glutathione (GSH) and protein carbonyl levels which were observed higher after drug treatment compared to the control group. The genotoxicity study was done using the Comet assay and increase in DNA tail has been detected. Furthermore, 8-OHdG levels were measured higher in favipiravir treated cells indicating oxidative DNA damage. Favipiravir induced oxidative stress leading to DNA damage in cardiomyoblast cells and fibroblastic skin cells. Oxidative stress and DNA damage might eventually lead to organ-specific damage such as cardiotoxicity and dermal toxicity. Considering the increased use of favipiravir in recent years, and that oxidative stress and genotoxicity are two important indicators of drug-induced toxicity, the obtained results are worth attention.

TI  - Anticipated pharmacological role of Aviptadil on COVID-19
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide that is produced by the lymphoid cells and plays a major role in immunological functions for controlling the homeostasis of the immune system. VIP has been identified as a potent anti-inflammatory factor, in boosting both innate and adaptive immunity. Since December 2019, SARS-Cov-2 was found responsible for the disease COVID-19 which has spread worldwide. No specific therapies or 100% effective vaccines are yet available for the treatment of COVID-19. Drug repositioning may offer a strategy and several drugs have been repurposed, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and tocilizumab. This paper describes the main pharmacological properties of synthetic VIP drug (Aviptadil) which is now under clinical trials. A patented formulation of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), named RLF-100 (Aviptadil), was developed and finally got approved for human trials by FDA in 2001 and in European medicines agency in 2005. It was awarded Orphan Drug Designation in 2001 by the US FDA for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome and for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in 2005. Investigational new drug (IND) licenses for human trials of Aviptadil was guaranteed by both the US FDA and EMEA. Preliminary clinical trials seem to support Aviptadil's benefit. However, such drugs like Aviptadil in COVID-19 patients have peculiar safety profiles. Thus, adequate clinical trials are necessary for these compounds.

TI  - Evaluation of Hepatic Biochemical Parameters during Antiviral Treatment in COVID-19 Patients
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary In order to treat COVID-19 disease, various drugs have been used as repurposed drugs, because no drug directly targets against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the drugs used for COVID-19 treatment and liver disturbances, in order to identify any change in liver enzymes during therapy. Patients admitted in an internal medicine department were treated with a complex therapeutic scheme, including antivirals. Beside the follow up for the evolution of the disease, we also monitored the potential occurrence of side effects, especially liver damage. Our results showed that none of the three antivirals that we used produced severe or significant liver disturbances. Our conclusion may be useful in guiding clinical practice, adding more information for the medical community. (1) Background: The antiviral treatment for COVID-19 disease started to be largely used in 2020 and has been found to be efficient, although it is not specific for SARS-CoV-2 virus. There were some concerns that it may produce liver damage or other side effects. (2) Methods: The aim of this study was to observe if antiviral therapy is affecting liver parameters or producing other side-effects in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease. The study included a group of patients hospitalized in the internal medicine department of Oradea Municipal Clinical Hospital, Romania, between August 2020-June 2021, diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 viral infection by RT-PCR method or rapid antigen test. During hospitalization, patients were treated with a Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) combination, or with Favipiravir or Remdesivir. In addition to monitoring the evolution of the disease (clinical and biochemical), also hepatic parameters were analyzed at admission, during hospitalization, and at discharge. (3) Results: In the group of studied patients, the mean value of aspartat aminotrensferase did not increase above normal at discharge, alanin aminotransferase increased, but below twice the normal values, and cholestasis registered a statistically insignificant slight increase. (4) Conclusions: In our study, we found that all three antivirals were generally well tolerated and their use did not alter liver function in a significant manner.

TI  - Coronene surface for delivery of Favipiravir: Computational approach
T2  - INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Delivery of pharmaceutical compounds has been always an important issue to be solved by appropriate methodologies. In this regard, coronene surface was investigated in this work for possible delivery of favipiravir (FAV) as a well-known drug for medication of COVID-19 pandemic. To this aim, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to explore surfaces of two representative carbon coronene (C) and boron nitride coronene (BN) models for adsorption of FAV drug. Consequently, complex formations of FAV@C and FAV@BN were examined using the computed molecular and atomic parameters. The results indicated that the FAV could interact with both of C and BN surfaces, but with better favorability of FAV@BN complex formation in comparison with FAV@C complex formation. Additionally, molecular orbitlas features indicated that the electronic behavior of FAV@BNC complex could be close to the original FAV in contrast with the results of FAV@CC complex. The evaluated diagrams of density of states (DOS) showed benefit of the employed models for sensor applications. The obtained features of quantum theory of atoms in molecule (QTAIM) affirmed formations interactions between substances and their strengths. Finally, FAV@BN complex was proposed as proper compound for further investigations of drug delivery processes.

TI  - Menthol-assisted homogenous liquid-liquid microextraction for HPLC/UV determination of favipiravir as an antiviral for COVID-19 in human plasma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Favipiravir is a promising antiviral agent that has been recently approved for treatment of COVID-19 infection. In this study, a menthol-assisted homogenous liquid-liquid microextraction method has been developed for favi-piravir determination in human plasma using HPLC/UV. The different factors that could affect the extraction efficiency were studied, including extractant type, extractant volume, menthol amount and vortex time. The optimum extraction efficiency was achieved using 300 mu L of tetrahydrofuran, 30 mg of menthol and vortexing for 1 min before centrifuging the sample for 5 min at 3467g. Addition of menthol does not only induce phase separation, but also helps to form reverse micelles to facilitate extraction. The highly polar favipiravir molecules would be incorporated into the hydrophilic core of the formed reverse micelle to be extracted by the non-polar organic extractant. The method was validated according to the FDA bioanalytical method guidelines. The developed method was found linear in the concentration range of 0.1 to 100 mu g/mL with a coefficient of determination of 0.9992. The method accuracy and precision were studied by calculating the recovery (%) and the relative standard deviation (%), respectively. The recovery (%) was in the range of 97.1-103.9%, while the RSD (%) values ranged between 2.03 and 8.15 %. The developed method was successfully applied in a bio-equivalence study of Flupirava (R) 200 mg versus Avigan (R) 200 mg, after a single oral dose of favipiravir administered to healthy adult volunteers. The proposed method was simple, cheap, more eco-friendly and suf-ficiently sensitive for biomedical application.

TI  - What We Learned about COVID-19 So Far? Notes from Underground
T2  - TURKISH THORACIC JOURNAL
AB  - The novel coronavirus pandemic poses a major global threat to public health. Our knowledge concerning every aspect of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly, given the increasing data from all over the world. In this narrative review, the Turkish Thoracic Society Early Career Taskforce members aimed to provide a summary on recent literature regarding epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control of COVID-19. Studies revealed that the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus showed significant identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor is an important target of the SARS-CoV-2 while entering an organism. Smokers were more likely to develop the disease and have a higher risk for ICU admission. The mean incubation period was 6.4 days, whereas asymptomatic transmission was reported up to 25 days after infection. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, and cardiovascular diseases and hypertension were reported to be the most common comorbidities among patients. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several patients showed typical symptoms and radiological changes with negative RT-PCR but positive IgG and IgM antibodies. Although radiological findings may vary, bilateral, peripherally distributed, ground-glass opacities were typical of COVID-19. Poor prognosis was associated with older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and high D-dimer level. Chloroquine was found to be effective in reducing viral replication in vitro. Likewise, protease inhibitors, including lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, and nucleoside analogue remdesivir were proposed to be the potential drug candidates in COVID-19 management. Despite these efforts, we still have much to learn regarding the transmission, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19.

TI  - Derivatization and combination therapy of current COVID-19 therapeutic agents: a review of mechanistic pathways, adverse effects, and binding sites
T2  - DRUG DISCOVERY TODAY
AB  - Current treatment of patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) involves repurposed drugs that inhibit viral infection by either binding to their respective targets or via modulating cellular signal transduction. However, there is still a great deal of efficacy enhancement through combination therapy and derivatization. Combination therapy should involve agents with significant activity and different mechanisms of action. The structural map of the interaction between a drug and its target protein will help guide drug discovery for devising safe and effective ways to treat COVID-19. Herein, we report numerous synthetic designs based on enhanced affinity to the viral carbohydrate-rich protein spikes and protein-binding sites of COVID-19.

TI  - Evaluation of electrocardiographic ventricular repolarization variables in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly recognized infectious disease that has spread rap-idly. COVID-19 has been associated with a number of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias. The mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19 is uncertain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ventricular repolarization by using the Tp-e interval, QT dispersion, Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio as candidate markers of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. In addition, the relationship between the repolarization parameters and the CRP (C-reactive protein) was investigated.
   Methods: 75 newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients, 75 age and sex matched healthy subjects were included in the study between 20th March 2020 and 10th April 2020. The risk of ventricular arrhythmias was evaluated by calculating the electrocardiographic Tp-e and QT interval, Tp-e dispersion, corrected QT(QTc), QT dispersion (QTd), corrected QTd, Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios. CRP values were also measured in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19.
   Results: Tp-e interval (80.7 4.6 vs. 70.9 +/- 4.8; p < .001), Tp-e / QT ratio (0.21 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.01; p <.001) and Tp-e/QTc ratio (0.19 +/- 0.01 vs.0.17 +/- 0.01; p <.001) were significantly higher in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 than the control group. There was a significant positive correlation between Tp-e interval, Tp-e/ QTc ratio and CRP in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 (rs = 0.332, p = .005, rs = 0.397, p < .001 consecutively). During their treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin and favipiravir, ventricular tachycardia episodes were observed in in two COVID-19 patients during their hospitalization in the intensive care unit.
   Conclusion: Our study showed for the first time in literature that the Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio, which are evaluated electrocardiographically in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19, were prolonged compared with normal healthy individuals. A positive correlation was determined between repolarization parameters and CRP. We believe that pre-treatment evaluation of repolarization parameters in newly diagnosed COVID-19 would be beneficial for predicting ventricular arrhythmia risk. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics of Antiviral Agents Used to Treat SARS-CoV-2 and Their Potential Interaction with Drugs and Other Supportive Measures: A Comprehensive Review by the PK/PD of Anti-Infectives Study Group of the European Society of Antimicrobial Agents
T2  - CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS
AB  - There is an urgent need to identify optimal antiviral therapies for COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. We have conducted a rapid and comprehensive review of relevant pharmacological evidence, focusing on (1) the pharmacokinetics (PK) of potential antiviral therapies; (2) coronavirus-specific pharmacodynamics (PD); (3) PK and PD interactions between proposed combination therapies; (4) pharmacology of major supportive therapies; and (5) anticipated drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We found promising in vitro evidence for remdesivir, (hydroxy)chloroquine and favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2; potential clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2 with remdesivir, the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus ribavirin; and strong evidence for LPV/r plus ribavirin against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) for post-exposure prophylaxis in healthcare workers. Despite these emerging data, robust controlled clinical trials assessing patient-centred outcomes remain imperative and clinical data have already reduced expectations with regard to some drugs. Any therapy should be used with caution in the light of potential drug interactions and the uncertainty of optimal doses for treating mild versus serious infections.

TI  - Synthesis and characterization of new thiazole-based Co(II) and Cu(II) complexes; therapeutic function of thiazole towards COVID-19 in comparing to current antivirals in treatment protocol
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB  - Two thiazole-based complexes were prepared from Co(II) and Cu(II) ions. The new ligand and its com-plexes were fully characterized by analytical and spectral techniques. The ligand behaved as a neutral tridentate in its keto-form towards the metals via O(8), O(10) and O(18) atoms. This was suggested based on the lower shift of upsilon(CH= O), upsilon(C= O)(amide) and upsilon(C-O) vibrations. The electronic transitions in Co(II)-HL and Cu(II)-HL complexes displayed d-d -transitions which belong to (4)T1g ->(4)A2g(F) & (4)T1g(F) ->(4)T1g (P) and (2)Eg ->(2)T2g, in the two complexes, respectively. ESR spectrum of Cu(II)-HL complex displayed g-factor by the following order; g(parallel to)(2.1740) > g(perpendicular to)(2.0935) > 2.0023, which agrees with octahedral geometry. The ge-ometry optimization was executed by DFT/B3LYP method under valence double zeta polarized basis set (6-31G *), to confirm the structural forms and the mode of bonding. The orientation and the charges of O(8), O(10) and O(18) atoms, support the coordination of the ligand in its keto-form with the metal ions. Pharmacophore profiles were obtained regarding thiazole ligand and other recommended drugs (ar-bidol, avigan and idoxuridine) that used in treatment protocol of COVID-19 pandemic. Also, query was run in MolPort-library to obtain antiviral analogues, to broaden the search for an effective treatment. Three analogues were obtained for arbidol, avigan and idoxuridine drugs, which have the following numbers; MolPort-047-605-64 4, MolPort-004-768-508 and MolPort-028-750-709, respectively. Moreover, molecu-lar docking was carried out to obtain all interaction details and rank the efficiency of thiazole compound versus the three antivirals in their interaction with the two COVID-19 proteins. The outcomes suggested the significant antiviral activity of idoxuridine and thiazole (enol-form), which not reach to eliminate the pandemic exactly. While, arbidol and avigan did not have an effective antiviral role, although they still used in COVID-19 treatment protocol. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Therapeutic Effectiveness and Safety of Repurposing Drugs for the Treatment of COVID-19: Position Standing in 2021
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - COVID-19, transmitted by SARS-CoV-2, is one of the most serious pandemic situations in the history of mankind, and has already infected a huge population across the globe. This horrendously contagious viral outbreak was first identified in China and within a very short time it affected the world's health, transport, economic, and academic sectors. Despite the recent approval of a few anti-COVID-19 vaccines, their unavailability and insufficiency along with the lack of other potential therapeutic options are continuing to worsen the situation, with valuable lives continuing to be lost. In this situation, researchers across the globe are focusing on repurposing prospective drugs and prophylaxis such as favipiravir, remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, lopinavir-ritonavir, azithromycin, doxycycline, ACEIs/ARBs, rivaroxaban, and protease inhibitors, which were preliminarily based on in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and toxicological study reports followed by clinical applications. Based on available preliminary data derived from limited clinical trials, the US National Institute of Health (NIH) and USFDA also recommended a few drugs to be repurposed i.e., hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and favipiravir. However, World Health Organization later recommended against the use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19 infections. Combining basic knowledge of viral pathogenesis and pharmacodynamics of drug molecules as well as in silico approaches, many drug candidates have been investigated in clinical trials, some of which have been proven to be partially effective against COVID-19, and many of the other drugs are currently under extensive screening. The repurposing of prospective drug candidates from different stages of evaluation can be a handy wellspring in COVID-19 management and treatment along with approved anti-COVID-19 vaccines. This review article combined the information from completed clinical trials, case series, cohort studies, meta-analyses, and retrospective studies to focus on the current status of repurposing drugs in 2021.

TI  - Investigation of Some Antiviral N-Heterocycles as COVID 19 Drug: Molecular Docking and DFT Calculations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a global health pandemic that started in December 2019. The effective drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease M-pro, because of its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. In this study, the bioactivity of some selected heterocyclic drugs named Favipiravir (1), Amodiaquine (2), 2 '-Fluoro-2 '-deoxycytidine (3), and Ribavirin (4) was evaluated as inhibitors and nucleotide analogues for COVID-19 using computational modeling strategies. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to estimate the thermal parameters, dipole moment, polarizability, and molecular electrostatic potential of the present drugs; additionally, Mulliken atomic charges of the drugs as well as the chemical reactivity descriptors were investigated. The nominated drugs were docked on SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6LU7) to evaluate the binding affinity of these drugs. Besides, the computations data of DFT the docking simulation studies was predicted that the Amodiaquine (2) has the least binding energy (-7.77 Kcal/mol) and might serve as a good inhibitor to SARS-CoV-2 comparable with the approved medicines, hydroxychloroquine, and remdesivir which have binding affinity -6.06 and -4.96 Kcal/mol, respectively. The high binding affinity of 2 was attributed to the presence of three hydrogen bonds along with different hydrophobic interactions between the drug and the critical amino acids residues of the receptor. Finally, the estimated molecular electrostatic potential results by DFT were used to illustrate the molecular docking findings. The DFT calculations showed that drug 2 has the highest of lying HOMO, electrophilicity index, basicity, and dipole moment. All these parameters could share with different extent to significantly affect the binding affinity of these drugs with the active protein sites.

TI  - Drug repurposing approach to fight COVID-19
T2  - PHARMACOLOGICAL REPORTS
AB  - Currently, there are no treatment options available for the deadly contagious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Drug repurposing is a process of identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs and it is considered as a very effective strategy for drug discovery as it involves less time and cost to find a therapeutic agent in comparison to the de novo drug discovery process. The present review will focus on the repurposing efficacy of the currently used drugs against COVID-19 and their mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, dosing, safety, and their future perspective. Relevant articles with experimental studies conducted in-silico, in-vitro, in-vivo, clinical trials in humans, case reports, and news archives were selected for the review. Number of drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab and interferons have shown inhibitory effects against the SARS-CoV2 in-vitro as well as in clinical conditions. These drugs either act through virus-related targets such as RNA genome, polypeptide packing and uptake pathways or target host-related pathways involving angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors and inflammatory pathways. Using the basic knowledge of viral pathogenesis and pharmacodynamics of drugs as well as using computational tools, many drugs are currently in pipeline to be repurposed. In the current scenario, repositioning of the drugs could be considered the new avenue for the treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of Teicoplanin in a Patient with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Receiving Veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) receiving ventilation or pulmonary support via veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) can be infected with drug-resistant bacteria. When introducing VV-ECMO, the changes in serum antibiotic concentration should be considered due to an increased volume of distribution (Vd). However, no pharmacokinetic study has assessed teicoplanin (TEIC) treatment in patients with COVID-19 receiving VV-ECMO. Case presentation A 71-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 visited a primary hospital. His oxygenation conditions worsened despite treatment with favipiravir and methylprednisolone as well as oxygen therapy. After his transfer to our center, tracheal intubation and steroid pulse therapy were initiated. Seven days after admission, VV-ECMO was performed. TEIC was administered for secondary bacterial infection. The serum TEIC concentration remained within the therapeutic range, indicating that VV-ECMO did not significantly affect TEIC pharmacokinetics. VV-ECMO was discontinued 17 days after admission. However, he developed multi-organ disorder and died 42 days after admission. Conclusion As TEIC prevents viral invasion, it may be used with ECMO in patients with COVID-19 requiring ventilation; however, the altered pharmacokinetics of TEIC, such as increased Vd, should be considered. Therefore, TEIC pharmacokinetics in VV-ECMO should be assessed in future studies with an appropriate number of patients.

TI  - Management of spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with COVID-19
T2  - INTERACTIVE CARDIOVASCULAR AND THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia may cause cystic features of lung parenchyma which can resolve or progress to larger blebs. Pneumothorax was more likely in patients with neutrophilia, severe lung injury and a prolonged clinical course. The timely diagnosis and management will reduce COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality.
   METHODS: We present 11 cases of spontaneous pneumothorax managed with chest tube thoracostomy or high-dose oxygen therapy. Isolated spontaneous pneumothorax was detected in all cases.
   RESULTS: Eight cases were male and 3 cases were female. There were bilateral ground-glass opacities or pulmonary infiltrates in the parenchyma of the 10 cases. We detected neutrophilia, lymphopaenia and increased C-reactive protein, Ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, D-Dimer, interleukin-6 levels in almost all cases. Chest tube thoracostomy was sufficient to treat pneumothorax in our 9 of case. In 2 cases, pneumothorax healed with high-dose oxygen therapy. Favipiravir and antibiotic treatment were given to different 10 patients. In our institution, all patients with COVID-19 infection were placed on prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation, unless contraindicated. The treatments of patients diagnosed with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax during the pandemic period and those diagnosed with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in the previous 3 years were compared with the durations of tube thoracostomy performed in both groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: The increased number of cases of pneumothorax suggests that pneumothorax may be a complication of COVID-19 infection. During medical treatment of COVID-19, pneumothorax may be the only reason for hospitalization. Although tube thoracostomy is a sufficient treatment option in most cases, clinicians should be aware of the difficulties that may arise in diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Simultaneous quantification of seven repurposed COVID-19 drugs remdesivir (plus metabolite GS-441524), chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir and azithromycin by a two-dimensional isotope dilution LC-MS/MS method in human serum
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS
AB  - Background: The present COVID-19 pandemic has prompted worldwide repurposing of drugs. The aim of the present work was to develop and validate a two-dimensional isotope-dilution liquid chromatrography tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LC-MS/MS) method for accurate quantification of remdesivir and its active metabolite GS-441524, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir and azithromycin in serum; drugs that have gained attention for repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19.
   Methods: Following protein precipitation, samples were separated with a two-dimensional ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (2D-UHPLC) setup, consisting of an online solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to an analytical column. For quantification, stable isotope-labelled analogues were used as internal standards for all analytes. The method was validated on the basis of the European Medicines Agency bioanalytical method validation protocol.
   Results: Detuning of lopinavir and ritonavir allowed simultaneous quantification of all analytes with different concentration ranges and sensitivity with a uniform injection volume of 5 mu L. The method provided robust validation results with inaccuracy and imprecision values of <= 9.59 % and <= 11.1 % for all quality controls.
   Conclusion: The presented method is suitable for accurate and simultaneous quantification of remdesivir, its metabolite GS-441525, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir and azithromycin in human serum. The quantitative assay may be an efficient tool for the therapeutic drug monitoring of these potential drug candidates in COVID-19 patients in order to increase treatment efficacy and safety.

TI  - Comparison of clinical and laboratory features in coronavirus disease 2019 and pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome patients
T2  - PEDIATRICS INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PIMS) are a major public health issue affecting many people worldwide. Although there are new studies in children, little is known about these two new conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical and laboratory features of children with COVID-19 and PIMS. Methods We conducted a prospective, single-center study of pediatric COVID-19 and PIMS at a tertiary care hospital in Turkey between November 2020 and March 2021. Results A total of 115 patients with COVID-19 and PIMS were examined during the study period. The median age was 60 (range, 1-215) months and 64% of the patients were male. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (70%) and cough (43%). Conjunctivitis and skin rash were not seen in PIMS patients. Of all patients, 64% had a history of close contact in household. Lymphopenia was present in 34/115 (30%) patients. Acute phase reactants were significantly higher in PIMS patients. Abnormal chest computed tomography scan findings were detected in 68% of the patients, while 36% had abnormal echocardiographic findings. In multivariate analysis, longer duration of fever, diarrhea, lower thrombocyte and higher neutrophil count were significantly associated with diagnosis of PIMS. The treatment included antibiotics, favipiravir, intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, interleukin-1 blockade. and supportive therapy. Seven patients (6%) required intensive care support. All patients were discharged without any complications, except one who died. Conclusions Longer duration of fever, diarrhea, lower thrombocyte, and higher neutrophil count can warn clinicians for diagnosis of PIMS.

TI  - Structural Basis for RNA Replication by the SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase
T2  - CELL
AB  - Nucleotide analog inhibitors, including broad-spectrum remdesivir and favipiravir, have shown promise in in vitro assays and some clinical studies for COVID-19 treatment, this despite an incomplete mechanistic understanding of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12 drug interactions. Here, we examine the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication by determining the cryo-EM structures of the stalled pre- and post- translocated polymerase complexes. Compared with the apo complex, the structures show notable structural rearrangements happening to nsp12 and its co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 to accommodate the nucleic acid, whereas there are highly conserved residues in nsp12, positioning the template and primer for an in-line attack on the incoming nucleotide. Furthermore, we investigate the inhibition mechanism of the triphosphate metabolite of remdesivir through structural and kinetic analyses. A transition model from the nsp7-nsp8 hexadecameric primase complex to the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 polymerase complex is also proposed to provide clues for the understanding of the coronavirus transcription and replication machinery.

TI  - Evaluation of Updated Therapeutic Options For COVID-19 in Pregnancy and Lactation
T2  - BEZMIALEM SCIENCE
AB  - A new respiratory tract infection caused by coronaviruses was identified in 2019 and called Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). It has long been known that pregnant women are not more susceptible to viral illness. However, changes to their immune system in pregnancy can he associated with more severe symptoms. Pregnant women do not seem to he at higher risk than non-pregnant individuals of severe COVID-19 infection. There arc currently no data suggesting an increased risk of miscarriage or malformations in relation to coronaviruses. There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Therapeutic options for patients with confirmed COVID-19 have been recently updated as hydroxychioroquine and/or azithromycin, and favipiravir for severe pneumonia. According to updated national treatment guidelines for COVID-19, favipiravir is not recommended for use in pregnant or breastfeeding women, but lop inavir/ritonavir can be used as second-line therapy. Published experience with COVID-19 during breastfeeding is limited. The main risk of breastfeeding is the close contact between mother and baby. This paper presents a literature review regarding outcomes after use of hydroxychloroquinc, azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir during pregnancy and lactation. Hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin use is not expected to increase the risk of birth defects and adverse effects in breastfed infants. Based on reports of human immunodeficiency virus- infected women, lopinavir/ritonavir use does not appear to increase the risk of adwise effects, and it may he chosen in life-threatening situations. It is important to pay special attention to the selection of drugs for COVID-19 and utilize the most up-to-date information to optimize outcorres for both infant and mother.

TI  - Analysis of long-term antibody response in COVID-19 patients by symptoms grade, gender, age, BMI, and medication
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
AB  - The first aim of the study was to analyze the change in antibody titer at 15-day intervals until 60 days postsymptom onset (PSO). The second aim was to analyze the relationship between antibody titer and symptom grade, gender, age, body mass index (BMI), medications, vitamin supplements, and herbal therapies. Blood samples were collected from 43 patients (5 mild, 21 moderate, 17 severe diseases), 18 women (41.9%), and 25 men (58.1%), on 15, 30, 45, and 60 days PSO after COVID-19 infection. The serum antibody titers were determined by measuring the COVID-19 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Associations between the duration of symptoms, demographic and clinical parameters, medications and vitamins used, and herbal therapies were evaluated by interviewing the participants. Within the first 15 days of illness, 81.4% of the patients were positive. From Day 45 PSO, seropositivity was 89.5%. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were statistically higher in men than women at all times (p < 0.01). Antibody titer was higher in older participants compared to younger participants (p < 0.02). Plaquenil or favipiravir use did not affect antibody response (p > 0.05). Men had a higher fever (p = 0.006), shortness of breath (p = 0.004), and chest pain (p = 0.03) than women. We found powerful antibody response by 60 days PSO, as well as higher antibody response and severity of symptoms in the men gender. Data also showed that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are higher in individuals with older age, whereas BMI, concomitant chronic disease, and medications had no effect on antibody titers.

TI  - Preliminary investigation of drug impurities associated with the anti-influenza drug Favipiravir - An insilico approach
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - The role of repurposed or modified antiviral drugs has become more significant during the current global pandemic of SARS Covid-19. In the present study, four structurally analogous impurity molecules of antiviral drug Favipiravir are selected for preliminary computational investigation for assessing the structure-activity relationship. The optimized geometry and the electronic structures of the compounds are computed using Density Functional Theory as a precursor to evaluating their physical, chemical and spectral properties. The frontier orbitals analysis is performed to obtain global reactivity parameters namely, the chemical potential, absolute electronegativity, global softness, global hardness, electrophilicity, etc. The natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis and Mulliken analysis provided an understanding of the charge-transfer interactions of molecules. The possibilities of intermolecular interactions of the drug systems with the receptors are also visualized using the electrostatic potential maps (MEP) derived from the DFT computations. The physiochemical properties are assessed computationally using SwissADME webtool to correlate the structural aspects of the compounds with their biological responses. Useful parameters namely flexibility, lipophilicity, size, polarity, solubility and saturation were also computed to evaluate the therapeutic activity or drug-likeness.

T2  - SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY
AB  - The present work describes development of rapid, robust, sensitive and green spectrofluorimetric method for determination of favipiravir (FAV). Different factors affecting fluorescence were carefully studied and Box Behnken Design was applied to optimize experimental parameters. The proposed method is based on measuring native fluorescence of FAV in 0.2 M borate buffer (pH 8.0) at 432 nm after excitation at 361 nm. There was a linear relationship between FAV concentration and relative fluorescence intensity over the range 40-280 ng/mL with limit of detection of 9.44 ng/mL and quantitation limit of 28.60 ng/ mL. The method was successfully implemented for determination of FAV in its pharmaceutical formulation with mean % recovery of 99.26 +/- 0.87. Moreover, the high sensitivity of the method allowed determination of FAV in spiked human plasma over a range of 48-192 ng/mL. The proposed spectrofluorimetric method was proved to be eco-friendly according to analytical eco-scale. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is essential for virus replication, therefore it is a promising drug target. Here we present a surface plasmon resonance approach to study the interaction of RdRp with drugs in real time. We monitored the effect of favipiravir, ribavirin, sofosbuvir triphosphate PSI-7409 and suramin on RdRp binding to RNA immobilized on the chip. Suramin precluded interaction of RdRp with RNA and even displaced RdRp from RNA.

TI  - IDentif.AI-Omicron: Harnessing an AI-Derived and Disease-Agnostic Platform to Pinpoint Combinatorial Therapies for Clinically Actionable Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Intervention
T2  - ACS NANO
AB  - Nanomedicine-based and unmodified drug interventions to address COVID-19 have evolved over the course of the pandemic as more information is gleaned and virus variants continue to emerge. For example, some early therapies (e.g., antibodies) have experienced markedly decreased efficacy. Due to a growing concern of future drug resistant variants, current drug development strategies are seeking to find effective drug combinations. In this study, we used IDentif.AI, an artificial intelligence-derived platform, to investigate the drug-drug and drug-dose interaction space of six promising experimental or currently deployed therapies at various concentrations: EIDD-1931, YH-53, nirmatrelvir, AT-511, favipiravir, and auranofin. The drugs were tested in vitro against a live B.1.1.529 (Omicron) virus first in monotherapy and then in 50 strategic combinations designed to interrogate the interaction space of 729 possible combinations. Key findings and interactions were then further explored and validated in an additional experimental round using an expanded concentration range. Overall, we found that few of the tested drugs showed moderate efficacy as monotherapies in the actionable concentration range, but combinatorial drug testing revealed significant dose-dependent drug-drug interactions, specifically between EIDD-1931 and YH-53, as well as nirmatrelvir and YH-53. Checkerboard validation analysis confirmed these synergistic interactions and also identified an interaction between EIDD-1931 and favipiravir in an expanded range. Based on the platform nature of IDentif.AI, these findings may support further explorations of the dose-dependent drug interactions between different drug classes in further pre-clinical and clinical trials as possible combinatorial therapies consisting of unmodified and nanomedicine-enabled drugs, to combat current and future COVID-19 strains and other emerging pathogens.

TI  - Baseline uric acid levels and steady-state favipiravir concentrations are associated with occurrence of hyperuricemia among COVID-19 patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Objectives: Favipiravir is an antiviral that is being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19. Use of favipiravir is associated with elevation of serum uric acid levels. Risk factors for the occurrence of hyperuricemia are unclear.
   Methods: Specimens from COVID-19 patients who received 10 days of favipiravir in a previous clinical trial (jRCTs041190120) were used. Serum favipiravir concentrations were measured by LC-MS. Factors associated with the development of hyperuricemia were investigated using logistic regression analysis. Optimal cut-off values for the baseline serum uric acid levels and steady-state serum favipiravir concentrations in predicting the occurrence of hyperuricemia were determined by ROC curve analysis.
   Results: Among the 66 COVID-19 patients who were treated with favipiravir for 10 days, the steady-state serum favipiravir concentrations were significantly correlated with serum uric acid levels. High baseline serum uric acid levels and steady-state serum favipiravir concentrations during therapy were factors associated with the development of hyperuricemia. The cut-off baseline serum uric acid level and steady-state serum favipiravir concentration during favipiravir administration determined to predict hyperuricemia were 3.7 mg/dL and 46.14 mu g/mL, respectively.
   Conclusions: Patients with high baseline serum uric acid levels or who achieved high steady-state serum favipiravir concentrations during therapy were susceptible to hyperuricemia. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

TI  - Pharmaceutical compounds used in the COVID-19 pandemic: A review of their presence in water and treatment techniques for their elimination
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, high consumption of antivirals, antibiotics, antiparasitics, antiprotozoals, and glucocorticoids used in the treatment of this virus has been reported. Conventional treatment systems fail to efficiently remove these contaminants from water, becoming an emerging concern from the environmental field. Therefore, the objective of the present work is to address the current state of the literature on the presence and removal processes of these drugs from water bodies. It was found that the concentration of most of the drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 increased during the pandemic in water bodies. Before the pandemic, Azithromycin concentrations in surface waters were reported to be in the order of 4.3 ng L-1, and during the pandemic, they increased up to 935 ng L-1. Laboratory scale studies conclude that adsorption and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can be effective in the removal of these drugs. Up to more than 80% removal of Azithromycin, Chloroquine, Ivermectin, and Dexamethasone in aqueous solutions have been reported using these processes. Pilot-scale tests achieved 100% removal of Azithromycin from hospital wastewater by adsorption with powdered activated carbon. At full scale, treatment plants supplemented with ozonation and artificial wetlands removed all Favipiravir and Azithromycin, respectively. It should be noted that hybrid technologies can improve removal rates, process kinetics, and treatment cost. Consequently, the development of new materials that can act synergistically in technically and economically sustainable treatments is required.

TI  - Intracranial Hemorrhage in a Pregnant Patient with COVID-19: A Case Report
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION MICROBES AND ANTIMICROBIALS
AB  - Pregnancy reportedly increased the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been found to be an associated factor. We report the case of a 26-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted to our hospital with a chief complaint of fatigue; she was diagnosed with COVID-19 and later developed ICH after cesarean section (C/S) delivery. The patient was tested for COVID-19 as her husband tested positive for it. After COVID-19 diagnosis, labor induction was decided due to amniorrhexis. Despite eight hours of labor induction, owing to the asynclitic presentation of the fetus, vaginal delivery did not progress; therefore, a C/S was performed. The patient gave birth to a healthy baby, and favipiravir treatment was initiated. On day nine of hospitalization, she complained of nausea and headache. Brain computed tomography revealed an intraparenchymal hematoma. The patient did not have any risk factors, except pregnancy. The hematoma was removed, and hemorrhage was resolved; however, a brain edema developed. After dexamethasone and mannitol treatment, her condition improved and she was transferred to the clinic. In conclusion, ICH can he observed in the postpartum period in a pregnant patient with COVID-19 with no risk factors other than pregnancy.

TI  - EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF SOME ETIOTROPIC THERAPEUTIC SCHEMES FOR TREATING PATIENTS WITH NOVEL CORONAVIRUS INFECTION (COVID-19)
T2  - PHARMACY & PHARMACOLOGY-FARMATSIYA I FARMAKOLOGIYA
AB  - The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the Favipiravir (Areplivir) drug, compared to the standard etiotropic therapy in the patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
   Material and methods. The research was conducted as a part of an open, randomized, multicenter comparative study of the efficacy and safety of Areplivir, 200 mg film-coated tablets ("PROMOMED RUS" LLC, Russia), in the patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The dosing regimen of Favipiravir was 1600 mg twice a day on the 1st day and 600 mg twice a day on days 2-14. Thirty nine patients were enrolled into the study with a laboratory-established diagnosis of a new type of Coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 (confirmed) of moderate severity, with pneumonia. The group of comparison (22 patients) received standard etiotropic therapy, prescribed in accordance with the current version of the temporary guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, represented mainly by Hydroxychloroquine with the dosage regimen of 800 mg on the 1st day, then 400 mg on days 2-14, and Azithromycin 500 mg once a day for 5 days. The main group (17 patients) received Favipiravir (Areplivir) as etiotropic therapy.
   Results. In the main group, the time period until fever disappeared was found to be 1.36 days shorter than in the group of comparison (p<0.05); there was a higher rate of the reduction of inflammatory changes in the lungs according to the computer tomography data (38.4% vs 14.9%, p<0.05). By the end of the treatment, there was also a lower lactate level in the blood (27.1%, p<0.05) than in the patients of the group of comparison. The evaluation of the drug efficacy according to the Categorical Ordinal Scale of Clinical Improvement and measurements of oxygen saturation in the blood, manifested similar positive dynamics in the patients treated according to various etiotropic therapy regimens. By the end of the treatment, the RNA SARS-CoV-2 tests were also negative in all the patients. As for the overall frequency of adverse events (AEs), no relevant distinctions were found between the groups. A greater part of AEs was related to hepatotoxicity, with a predominantly clinically relevant increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). A clinically relevant prolongation of the corrected QT interval on the standard ECG was found to occur in the standard-therapy group on day 5, while no serious AEs were registered in the main group. No serious adverse reactions were registered in patients of the main group.
   Conclusion. The efficacy of the Favipiravir (Areplivir) therapy for the novel coronavirus infection has proved to be superior to the efficacy of the standard etiotropic therapy in a number of aspects. Basing on the obtained findings, Favipiravir (Areplivir) drug can be recommended for treating patients with the novel coronavirus infection of moderate severity.

TI  - Combination therapy with nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir improves the survival of SARS-CoV-2 infected mice
T2  - ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH
AB  - As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic remains uncontrolled owing to the continuous emergence of variants of concern, there is an immediate need to implement the most effective antiviral treatment strategies, especially for risk groups. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potency of nirmatrelvir, remdesivir and molnupiravir, and their combinations in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Systemic treatment of mice with each drug (20 mg/kg) resulted in slightly enhanced antiviral efficacy and yielded an increased life expectancy of only about 20-40% survival. However, combination therapy with nirmatrelvir (20 mg/kg) and molnupiravir (20 mg/kg) in lethally infected mice showed profound inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in both the lung and brain and synergistically improved survival rates up to 80% compared to those with nirmatrelvir (36%, P < 0.001) and molnupiravir (43%, P < 0.001) administered alone. This combination therapy effectively reduced clinical severity score, virus-induced tissue damage, and viral distribution compared to those in animals treated with these monotherapies. Furthermore, all these assessments associated with this combination were also significantly higher than that of mice receiving remdesivir monotherapy (P < 0.001) and the nirmatrelvir (20 mg/kg) and remdesivir (20 mg/kg) combination (P < 0.001), underscored the clinical significance of this combination. By contrast, the nirmatrelvir and remdesivir combination showed less antiviral efficacy, with lower survival compared to nirmatrelvir monotherapy due to the insufficient plasma exposure of the remdesivir, demonstrating the inefficient therapeutic effect of this combination in the mouse model. The combination therapy with nir-matrelvir and molnupiravir contributes to alleviated morbidity and mortality, which can serve as a basis for the design of clinical studies of this combination in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Comparing ICU admission rates of mild/moderate COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine plus favipiravir
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: In this study, we aimed to compare the intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate of hospitalized mild/moderate COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), favipiravir, and HCQ plus favipiravir. Methods: Single center retrospective designed observational study conducted in Ankara City Hospital. Patients who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020 and June 1, 2020 in COVID-19 inpatient clinics with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in the study. An inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for multiple treatment groups approach was used to balance the differences in several variables on admission. Results: Among 2441 patients hospitalized with diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period, 824 were eligible for the analysis. Median age of patients was 42 (18?93 years). Among all, 347 (43.2%) of the patients had mild disease, 470 (56.8%) had pneumonia. Propensity scores ranged from 0.1841 to 0.9381 in the HCQ group, from 0.03643 to 0.29885 in the favipiravir group, and from 0.03542 to 0.56184 in the HCQ plus favipiravir group. After IPTW for multiple treatment groups was applied, all the covariates in the planned propensity score had weighted standardized effect sizes below 10% which were ranged from 0.005 to 0.092. Multivariate analysis of treatment effect (adjusted effect of treatment) was indicated that there is no statistically significant difference between HCQ, favipiravir, and HCQ plus favipiravir treatment. After using combination of SMOTE and Bootstrap resampling approach, we found no statistically significant difference between HCQ and HCQ plus favipiravir groups in terms of ICU admission. However, compared with the HCQ group, ICU admission rate was statistically significantly higher in the favipiravir group. We obtained the similar results after the sensitivity analysis.

TI  - Ilimaquinone (marine sponge metabolite) as a novel inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 key target proteins in comparison with suggested COVID-19 drugs: designing, docking and molecular dynamics simulation study
T2  - RSC ADVANCES
AB  - The outbreak of novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 36 million people and caused approximately 1 million deaths around the globe as of 9 October 2020. The escalating outspread of the virus and rapid rise in the number of cases require the instantaneous development of effectual drugs and vaccines. Presently, there are no approved drugs or vaccine available to treat the infection. In such scenario, one of the propitious therapeutic approaches against viral infection is to explore enzyme inhibitors amidst natural compounds, utilizing computational approaches aiming to get products with negligible side effects. In the present study, the inhibitory prospects of ilimaquinone (marine sponge metabolite) were assessed in comparison with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, favipiravir, ivermectin and remdesivir at the active binding pockets of nine different vital SARS-CoV-2 target proteins (spike receptor binding domain, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Nsp10, Nsp13, Nsp14, Nsp15, Nsp16, main protease, and papain-like-protease), employing an in silico molecular interaction based approach. In addition, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro)-ilimaquinone complex were also carried out to calculate various structural parameters including root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (R-g) and hydrogen bond interactions. PLpro is a promising drug target, due to its imperative role in viral replication and additional function of stripping ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from host-cell proteins. In light of the possible inhibition of all vital SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, our study has emphasized the importance to study in depth ilimaquinone actions in vivo.

TI  - Investigation of the disease process and drug combinations in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 using favipiravir
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Aims It is aimed to investigate the disease processes and drug combinations in patients who received favipiravir treatment.
   Methods This cross-sectional, analytical and retrospective study included all patients aged >= 18 years (n = 502) who were hospitalised in Samsun, Turkey, for COVID-19 and were given favipiravir from the date between 25 March 2020 and 3 June 2020.
   Results In total, 58.6% (n = 294) of the patients were male and 24.5% (n = 123) were between the ages of 71 and 80 years. During the first case process, the mortality rate was 19.9%, whereas the rate of those who were discharged as is/followed up at home for 14 days was 37.3%. During the second case process, the mortality rate was 6.2%, and the rate of those who was discharged as is/followed up at home for 14 days was 65.6%. The mean length of hospital stay was 10.61 +/- 8.17 days for the first and 7.97 +/- 4.16 days for the second hospitalisation; this difference was significant. Mortality risk of those who used Tocilizumab or vitamin C beside Favipiravir was higher than those who did not. The length of hospital stay was higher in patients using tocilizumab than in those who did not (P < .001).
   Conclusion Administration of favipiravir later in the course of the disease makes it difficult to achieve the true efficacy expected from the drug and also makes it difficult for other combination drugs to contribute to survival. Favipiravir may also be effective in case of recurrence.

TI  - Modification of immunosuppressive agents in a kidney transplant recipient with COVID-19 and acute kidney injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB  - Introduction: An outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has occurred in different parts of the world. Although a large piece of information regarding the epidemiology, clinical features, and management of COVID-19 has been reported in the general population, there is very limited data regarding organ transplant recipients, particularly regarding the management of maintenance immunosuppressive agents during infection. Methodology: We described a case of kidney transplant recipient from Thailand who had COVID-19 pneumonia and severe acute kidney injury. Results: The patient's serum creatinine peaked at 7.0 mg/dL on day 15 of illness and returned to baseline value of 2.0 mg/dL on day 26 of illness. We have shown how we modified tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and steroids in the patient who had received favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusions: In this case, successful modification of this immunosuppressive regimen was accomplished to reduce drug interaction complications, aiming to avoid calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity while maintaining appropriate levels of immunosuppression to prevent organ rejection and to promote the patient's recovery from infection.

TI  - The Effectiveness and Safety of Favipiravir in COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients at Tertiary Referral Hospital, Bali, Indonesia
T2  - KESMAS-NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH JOURNAL
AB  - COVID-19 is a major public health problem, with still questionable specific cure. Favipiravir is a COVID-19 antiviral that is potentially a therapy for COVID-19. This study aimed to analyze its effectivity and safety in moderate to critical hospitalized patients. This study was a retrospective cohort in a tertiary referral hospital in Denpasar City, Bali Province, Indonesia, from August 2020 to January 2021. There was a total of 192 patients; 96 in the favipiravir group and 96 in the non-favipiravir group (remdesivir/oseltamivir). Effectivity was measured by assessing the clinical condition at the end of the isolation period of 14 days. The favipiravir group showed better clinical conditions than the non-favipiravir group (79.2% vs. 56.3%; adjusted RR = 2.196; 95% CI = 1.084 - 4.451; p-value = 0.029), seen from being free of fever and respiratory problems. Stratification analysis demonstrated that the clinical improvement was significantly different in the severe/critical group in favor of favipiravir (RR = 1.573; 95% CI = 1.139-2.172). The most common non-serious adverse events (AE) found in the use of favipiravir were gastrointestinal disturbances (12.5%). In brief, favipiravir is effective in severe/critical cases, and less serious AE were found in its use. Appropriate treatment is expected to help in reducing the public health burden.

TI  - Challenges in COVID-19 drug treatment in patients with advanced liver diseases: A hepatology perspective
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB  - The global incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to increase despite health care efforts. The disease is caused by coronavirus 2 with high transmission and mortality rates. Little is known about the management of COVID-19 in advanced liver disease. The aim of work was to propose a plan for management of this drastic disease in case of this specific population with review of medications that could be suitable for advanced liver disease. All the guidelines and medications available for treatment of COVID-19 were reviewed with selection of the less toxic medications that could be used in advanced liver disease. Drugs suitable to manage COVID-19 in patients with liver disease might include remdesivir intravenously, nitazoxanide + sofosbuvir, ivermectin, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma, and low molecular weight heparin in certain situations. Advanced liver disease is associated with portal hypertension and splenomegaly with reduction of blood elements and immune dysfunction and impaired T cell function. Thus, when confronted by cytokine storm as an immune response to COVID-19, there may be an increase in the mortality rate of these patients. Through this review, a plan to treat COVID-19 in this special group of patients with advanced cirrhosis is proposed.

TI  - Outcome of noncritical COVID-19 patients with early hospitalization and early antiviral treatment outside the ICU
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background/aim: Despite the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has been going on for over 5 months, there is yet to be a standard management policy for all patients including those with mild-to-moderate cases. We evaluated the role of early hospitalization in combination with early antiviral therapy with COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care university hospital.
   Materials and methods: This was a prospective, observational, single-center study on probable/confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital on COVID-19 wards between March 20 and April 30, 2020. The demographic, laboratory, and clinical data were collected.
   Results: We included 174 consecutive probable/confirmed COVID-19 adult patients hospitalized in the Internal Medicine wards of the University Adult Hospital between March 20 and April 30, 2020. The median age was 45.5 (19-92) years and 91 patients (52.3%) were male. One hundred and twenty (69%) were confirmed microbiologically, 41 (23.5%) were radiologically diagnosed, and 13 (7.5%) were clinically suspected (negative microbiological and radiological findings compatible with COVID-19); 35 (20.1%) had mild, 107 (61.5%) moderate disease, and 32 (18.4%) had severe pneumonia. Out of 171 cases, 130 (74.3%) showed pneumonia; 80 were typical, and 50 showed indeterminate infiltration for COVID-19. Patients were admitted within a median of 3 days (0-14 days) after symptoms appear. The median duration of hospitalization was 4 days (0-28 days). In this case series, 13.2% patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine alone, 64.9% with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 18.4% with regimens including favipiravir. A total of 15 patients (8.5%) were transferred to the ICU. Four patients died (2.2%).
   Conclusion: In our series, 174 patients were admitted to the hospital wards for COVID-19, 69% were confirmed with PCR and/or antibody test. At the time of admission, nearly one fifth of the patients had severe diseases. Of the patients, 95.4% received hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination. The overall case fatality rate was 2.2%.

TI  - Drug repurposing strategies and key challenges for COVID-19 management
T2  - JOURNAL OF DRUG TARGETING
AB  - COVID-19 is a clinical outcome of viral infection emerged due to strain of beta coronavirus which attacks the type-2 pneumocytes in alveoli via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. There is no satisfactory drug developed against 'SARS-CoV2', highlighting an immediate necessity chemotherapeutic repurposing plan COVID-19. Drug repurposing is a method of selection of approved therapeutics for new use and is considered to be the most effective drug finding strategy since it includes less time and cost to obtain treatment compared to the de novo drug acquisition process. Several drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, teicoplanin, darunavir, ritonavir, nitazoxanide, chloroquine, tocilizumab and favipiravir (FPV) showed their activity against 'SARS-CoV2' in vitro. This review has emphasized on repurposing of drugs, and biologics used in clinical set up for targeting COVID-19 and to evaluate their pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety with their future aspect. The key benefit of drug repurposing is the wealth of information related to its safety, and easy accessibility. Altogether repurposing approach allows access to regulatory approval as well as reducing sophisticated safety studies.

TI  - Drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics drugs: integrated evidence from 4 databases and a systematic review
T2  - PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Rationale Management of anxiety, delirium, and agitation cannot be neglected in coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Antipsychotics are usually used for the pharmacological management of delirium, and confusion and behavioral disturbances. The concurrent use of treatments for COVID-19 and antipsychotics should consider eventual drug-drug interactions Objective To systematically review evidence-based available on drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics. Evidence review Three databases were consulted: Lexicomp (R) Drug Interactions, Micromedex (R) Solutions Drugs Interactions, and Liverpool (c) Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. To acquire more information on QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes (TdP), the CredibleMeds (R) QTDrugs List was searched. The authors made a recommendation agreed to by consensus. Additionally, a systematic review of drug-drug interactions between antipsychotics and COVID-19 treatment was conducted. Results The main interactions between COVID-19 drugs and antipsychotics are the risk of QT-prolongation and TdP, and cytochromes P450 interactions. Remdesivir, baricinitib, and anakinra can be used concomitantly with antipsychotics without risk of drug-drug interaction (except for hematological risk with clozapine and baricinitib). Favipiravir only needs caution with chlorpromazine and quetiapine. Tocilizumab is rather safe to use in combination with antipsychotics. The most demanding COVID-19 treatments for coadministration with antipsychotics are chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir because of the risk of QT prolongation and TdP and cytochromes interactions. The systematic review provides highly probable drug interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir plus quetiapine and ritonavir/indinavir plus risperidone. Conclusions Clinicians prescribing antipsychotics should be aware of the likely risk of drug-drug interaction with COVID-19 medication and may benefit from taking into account present recommendations of use to preserve patient safety

T2  - RSC MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic, which has affected the whole world and has caused unprecedented social and economic disruption. Since the emergence of the disease, several druggable targets have been suggested including 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)), spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the papain-like protease (PLpro) computational approach. From the beginning, viral replication has been the main focus for any antiviral drug development for viral diseases, including HCV, influenza virus, zika virus, norovirus, measles, dengue virus, and coronaviruses. This review lists the nucleoside, nucleotide, and non-nucleoside RdRp inhibitor analogues of various viral diseases that may be evaluated for drug development to treat COVID-19.

TI  - The incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of COVID-19 in a prospectively followed cohort of patients with Behcet's syndrome
T2  - RHEUMATOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Initial case series of small number of patients at the beginning of the pandemic reported a rather guarded prognosis for Behcet's syndrome (BS) patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this prospective study, we describe the incidence, clinical characteristics, disease course, management, and outcome in a large cohort of BS patients with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2. We defined a cohort of 1047 registered BS patients who were aged between 16 and 60 years and seen routinely before the pandemic at the multidisciplinary outpatient clinic. We followed prospectively this cohort from beginning of April 2020 until the end of April 2021. During 13 months of follow-up, of the 1047 (599 M/448 F) patients, 592 (56.5%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 PCR at least once and 215 (20.5%; 95% CI 0.18-0.23) were tested positive. We observed 2 peaks which took place in December 2020 and April 2021. Of the 215 PCR positive patients, complete information was available in 214. Of these 214, 14 (6.5%) were asymptomatic for COVID-19. In the remaining, the most common symptoms were anosmia, fatigue, fever, arthralgia, and headache. A total of 40 (18.7%) had lung involvement, 25 (11.7%) were hospitalized, 1 was admitted to the intensive care unit while none died. Favipiravir was the most prescribed drug (74.3%), followed by colchicine (40.2%), and hydroxychloroquine (20.1%) in the treatment of COVID-19. After COVID-19, 5 patients (2.3%) were given supplemental O-2 and 31 (14.5%) antiaggregant or anticoagulants. During COVID-19, of the 214 PCR positive patients, 116 (54.2%) decreased the dose of their immunosuppressives or stopped taking completely; 36 (16.8%) experienced a BS flare which was mostly oral ulcers (10.3%). None of the patients reported a thrombotic event. A total of 93 (43.5%) patients reported BS flares after a median 45 days of COVID-19 infection and this was found to be significantly associated with immunosuppressive drug discontinuation. Multiple regression analysis adjusted for age and gender indicated that smoking and using interferon-alpha decreased the likelihood of getting COVID-19. The incidence and severity of COVID-19 did not differ between those who were using colchicine or not. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in this prospectively followed cohort of BS patients was almost two folds of that estimated for the general population living in Istanbul, Turkey, however, the clinical outcome of COVID-19 was not severe and there was no mortality. The protective effect of smoking and interferon deserves further investigation. On the other hand, colchicine did not have any positive or negative effect against COVID-19. Significant number of patients flared after COVID-19, however, this was significantly associated with immunosuppressive discontinuation during the infection. Contrary to our previous observations, COVID-19 did not seem to exacerbate thrombotic events during or after the infection.

TI  - Disease progression of 213 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in the Czech Republic in March-October 2020: An exploratory analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - We collected a multi-centric retrospective dataset of patients (N = 213) who were admitted to ten hospitals in Czech Republic and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the early phases of the pandemic in March-October 2020. The dataset contains baseline patient characteristics, breathing support required, pharmacological treatment received and multiple markers on daily resolution. Patients in the dataset were treated with hydroxychloroquine (N = 108), azithromycin (N = 72), favipiravir (N = 9), convalescent plasma (N = 7), dexamethasone (N = 4) and remdesivir (N = 3), often in combination. To explore association between treatments and patient outcomes we performed multiverse analysis, observing how the conclusions change between defensible choices of statistical model, predictors included in the model and other analytical degrees of freedom. Weak evidence to constrain the potential efficacy of azithromycin and favipiravir can be extracted from the data. Additionally, we performed external validation of several proposed prognostic models for Covid19 severity showing that they mostly perform unsatisfactorily on our dataset.

TI  - ICU admission rates in Istanbul following the addition of favipiravir to the national COVID-19 treatment protocol
T2  - NORTHERN CLINICS OF ISTANBUL
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to understand the observational relationship between adoption of favipiravir into the national COVID-19 treatment protocol and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates in Istanbul due to COVID-19.
   METHODS: Data were harvested from the "Public Health Management System-HSYS," which collate centrally the records of all known cases of COVID-19. The total number of cases, numbers admitted to ICU, and number undergoing intubation were compared between 2 time periods: 11th of March, the date on which the first case in Turkey was confirmed, to 30th of March; and March 30, to 10th of April, 5 days after Favipiravir was introduced into the treatment algorithm when, the records were examined.
   RESULTS: The percentage of patients requiring ICU admission diminished from 24% to 12%, whilst the percentage intubated fell from 77% to 66%. These differences were both statistically significant.
   CONCLUSION: The addition of favipiravir to the national COVID-19 treatment protocol may explain this rapid decrease in the rate of ICU admissions and intubation.

TI  - Outcome of COVID-19 in interstitial lung disease patients treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and antiviral drugs
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - A recent study reported that patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) are at increased risk of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there are no studies on the outcome of COVID-19 patients with preexisting ILD treated with corticosteroids or antiviral drugs. We extracted 26 patients with preexisting ILD by medical records and HRCT pattern. Of 503 patients with COVID-19, we selected 52 patients as control matched for age and sex. Twenty out of the 26 ILD patients (76.9%) received corticosteroid therapy, and 23 patients (88.5%) also received antiviral treatment with remdesivir or favipiravir. Although no statistical difference was found, the proportion of severe patients in ILD group tended to be higher than in non-ILD group (23.1% vs. 42.3%; p = 0.114). Also, mortality rate in ILD group tended to be higher than in non-ILD patients (11.5% vs. 3.8%; p = 0.326). In univariate analysis to evaluate risk factors for severe condition, diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, and honeycomb lung were not risk factors of severe disease. Treatment with corticosteroids, antiviral drugs, and immunosuppressive agents may affect the outcome of COVID-19 patients with ILD.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy for acute respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses: current possibilities
T2  - TERAPEVTICHESKII ARKHIV
AB  - Routinely the influenza virus significantly contributes to the formation of the annual incidence of acute respiratory infections, with a peak in winter season. the high level of mutagenic potential of influenza viruses is a standard factor determining the complexity of the rational choice of pharmacotherapy. The upcoming epidemiological season 2020 2021 brings additional challenges for health care practitioners mediated by the widespread prevalence in the human population of a new infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus affecting the respiratory system among many organs and systems. An adequate choice of pharmacotherapy tools should be based on high efficiency and safety of drugs, with a possible reduction in such negative factors as polypharmacy. This review includes comparative phamiacological characteristics of drugs with activity against RNA viruses, along with parameters of their clinical efficacy.

TI  - Potential Drug Interactions of Repurposed COVID-19 Drugs with Lung Cancer Pharmacotherapies
T2  - ARCHIVES OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Lung cancer patients are at heightened risk for developing COVID-19 infection as well as complications due to multiple risk factors such as underlying malignancy, anti-cancer treatment induced immunosuppression, additional comorbidities and history of smoking. Recent literatures have reported a significant proportion of lung cancer patients coinfected with COVID-19. Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and umifenovir represent the major repurposed drugs used as potential experimental agents for COVID-19 whereas azithromycin, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, sarilumab, famotidine and ceftriaxone are some of the supporting agents that are under investigation for COVID-19 management. The rationale of this review is to identify potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) occurring in lung cancer patients receiving lung cancer medications and repurposed COVID-19 drugs using Micromedex and additional literatures. This review has identified several potential DDIs that could occur with the concomitant treatments of COVID-19 repurposed drugs and lung cancer medications. This information may be utilized by the healthcare professionals for screening and identifying potential DDIs with adverse outcomes, based on their severity and documentation levels and consequently design prophylactic and management strategies for their prevention. Identification, reporting and management of DDIs and dissemination of related information should be a major consideration in the delivery of lung cancer care during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for better patient outcomes and updating guidelines for safer prescribing practices in this coinfected condition.

TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis of effectiveness and safety of favipiravir in the management of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) patients
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Multiple options are being tried for the management of 2019-nCoV infection since its pandemic started. Favipiravir (FPV) is one of drugs, which is also being tried for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FPV in published literature. Comparative randomized or nonrandomized controlled clinical trials comparing FPV to the standard of care (SOC)/control or other antiviral agent/combinations were included. A total of 12 databases were searched and identify four studies which were further used for final analysis. The data analysis was done as pooled prevalence using a random effect model by "RevMan manager version 5.4.1 and "R" software. The point estimate, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for dichotomous data. In the present study, the marginal beneficial effect was seen in the FPV group in overall clinical improvement comparison to SOC/control, i.e., (4 studies, log OR [95% CI] (-0.19 [-0.51, 0.13]). However, in all other outcomes, it was found to be comparable to the SOC/control arm namely "clinical improvement on day 7-10" (3 studies, OR [95% CI] 1.63 [1.07, 2.48]) while "clinical improvement on day 10-14" (3 studies, OR [95% CI] 1.37 [0.24, 7.82]) and viral negativity was seen (4 studies, OR [95% CI] 1.91 [0.91, 4.01]). No difference in efficacy was found between FPV versus lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol groups. Regarding adverse effects, except for the occurrence of rash (higher in the FPV group), safety was comparable to SOC. In our study, there was a marginal difference between the FPV and the SOC arm in terms of "clinical improvement" on day 7-10 or 10-14, and "virological negativity" on day 10-14." However, some benefit was observed in a few studies, but it was also comparable to the control drugs or SOC.

TI  - Novel beta-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): Current and future aspects of pharmacological treatments
T2  - SAUDI PHARMACEUTICAL JOURNAL
AB  - The novel coronavirus outbreak has reported to be rapidly spreading across the countries and becomes a foremost community health alarm. At present, no vaccine or specific drug is on hand for the treatment of this infectious disease. This review investigates the drugs, which are being evaluated and found to be effective against nCOVID-19 infection. A thorough literature search was performedon the recently published research papers in between January 2020 to May 2020, through various databases like "Science Direct", "Google Scholar", "PubMed","Medline", "Web of Science", and "World Health Organization (WHO)". We reviewed and documented the information related with the current and future aspects for the management and cure of COVID-19. As of 21st July 2020 a total of 14,562,550 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 607,781 deaths have been reported world-wide. The main clinical feature of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic disease to mild lower respiratory tract illness to severe pneumonia, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction, and death. The drugs at present used in COVID-19 patients and ongoing clinical trials focusing on drug repurposing of various therapeutic classes of drug e.g. antiviral, anti-inflammatory and/or immunomodulatory drugs along with adjuvant/supportive care. Many drugs on clinical trials shows effective results on preliminary scale and now used currently in patients. Adjuvant/supportive care therapy are used in patients to get the best results in order to minimize the short and long-term complications. However, further studies and clinical trials are needed on large scale of population to reach any firm conclusion in terms of its efficacy and safety. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Multicentre randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of favipiravir in adults with mild COVID-19
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction A novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, caused an international outbreak of a respiratory illness, termed COVID-19 in December 2019. There is a lack of specific therapeutic agents based on evidence for this novel coronavirus infection; however, several medications have been evaluated as a potential therapy. Therapy is required to treat symptomatic patients and decrease the virus carriage duration to limit the communitytransmission.
   Methods and analysis We hypothesise that patients with mild COVID-19 treated with favipiravir will have a shorter duration of time to virus clearance than the control group. The primary outcome is to evaluate the effect of favipiravir on the timing of the PCR test conversion from positive to negative within 15 days after starting the medicine. Adults (>18 years, men or nonpregnant women, diagnosed with mild COVID-19 within 5 days of disease onset) are being recruited by physicians participating from the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs and the Ministry of Health ethics committee approved primary healthcare centres. This double-blind, randomised trial comprises three significant parts: screening, treatment and a follow-up period. The treating physician and patients are blinded. Eligible participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the therapy group (favipiravir) or a control group (placebo) with 1800 mg by mouth two times per day for the first day, followed by 800 mg two times per day for 4-7 days. Serial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples are obtained on day 1 (5 days before therapy). On day5 +/- 1 day, 10 +/- 1 day, 15 +/- 2 days, extra nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR COVID-19 samples are requested.
   The primary analysis population for evaluating both the efficacy and safety outcomes will be a modified intention to treat population. Anticipating a 10% dropout rate, we expect to recruit 288 subjects per arm. The results assume that the hazard ratio is constant throughout the study and that the Cox proportional hazard regression is used to analyse the data.
   Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre Institutional Review Board (28 April 2020) and the Ministry of Health Institutional Review Board (1 July 2020). Protocol details and any amendments will be reported to https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04464408. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

T2  - POLYHEDRON
AB  - Three new mixed-ligand copper(II) complexes (1-3) with NN'O type unsymmetrical tridentate Schiff base ligands (SB) and N-donor heterocyclic co-ligands, with general formula [Cu(SB)(L)]ClO4, were synthesized and characterized using single crystal x-ray diffraction (SCXRD), FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy and elemental analyses. The SB ligand is the half-unit form of the condensation of 1,3-propanediamine with 5-methoxysalicylaldehyde and the co-ligands (L) are pyridine (py in (L)), 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy in (2)) and 1,10-phenanthroline (phen in (3)). Crystal structures of (2) and (3) were obtained by SCXRD. Molecular docking and pharmacophore studies were performed to study the interactions between the synthesized complexes and SARS-CoV-2 virus main pmteases (PDB IDs: 6LU7, 6WQF and 6W9C). Results revealed that complex (3) with phen co-ligand showed better docking scores with the three receptors, i.e. 6LU7 (-8.05 kcal.mol(-1)), 6W9C (-7.70 kcal.mol(-1)) and 6WQF (-7.75 kcal.mol(-1)). The order of the binding best energies for (3) was also as follows: 6LU7 > 6WQF > 6W9C. All of the studied complexes showed considerable performance, comparable to the standard drug, Favipiravir.

TI  - COVID-19: Pathophysiology, Transmission, and Drug Development for Therapeutic Treatment and Vaccination Strategies
T2  - CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB  - COVID-19, a dreaded and highly contagious pandemic, is flagrantly known for its rapid prevalence across the world. Till date, none of the treatments are distinctly accessible for this life-threatening disease. Under the prevailing conditions of a medical emergency, one creative strategy for the identification of novel and potential antiviral agents gaining momentum in research institutions and progressively being leveraged by pharmaceutical companies is target-based drug repositioning/repurposing. Continuous monitoring and recording of results offer anticipation that this strategy may help to reveal new medications for viral infections. This review recapitulates the neoteric illation of COVID-19, its genomic dispensation, molecular evolution via phylogenetic assessment, drug targets, the most frequently worldwide used repurposed drugs and their therapeutic applications, and a recent update on vaccine management strategies. The available data from solidarity trials exposed that the treatment with several known drugs, viz. lopinavir-ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, etc. had displayed various antagonistic effects along with no impactful result in the diminution of mortality rate. The drugs, like remdesivir, favipiravir, and ribavirin, have proved to be quite safer therapeutic options for treatment against COVID-19. Similarly, dexamethasone, convalescent plasma therapy and oral administration of 2DG are expected to reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Analytical Performance and Greenness Evaluation of Five Multi-Level Design Models Utilized for Impurity Profiling of Favipiravir, a Promising COVID-19 Antiviral Drug
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - In 2018, the discovery of carcinogenic nitrosamine process related impurities (PRIs) in a group of widely used drugs led to the recall and complete withdrawal of several medications that were consumed for a long time, unaware of the presence of these genotoxic PRIs. Since then, PRIs that arise during the manufacturing process of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), together with their degradation impurities, have gained the attention of analytical chemistry researchers. In 2020, favipiravir (FVR) was found to have an effective antiviral activity against the SARS-COVID-19 virus. Therefore, it was included in the COVID-19 treatment protocols and was consequently globally manufactured at large-scales during the pandemic. There is information indigence about FVR impurity profiling, and until now, no method has been reported for the simultaneous determination of FVR together with its PRIs. In this study, five advanced multi-level design models were developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of FVR and two PRIs, namely; (6-chloro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide) and (3,6-dichloro-pyrazine-2-carbonitrile). The five developed models were classical least square (CLS), principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS), genetic algorithm-partial least squares (GA-PLS), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Five concentration levels of each compound, chosen according to the linearity range of the target analytes, were used to construct a five-level, three-factor chemometric design, giving rise to twenty-five mixtures. The models resolved the strong spectral overlap in the UV-spectra of the FVR and its PRIs. The PCR and PLS models exhibited the best performances, while PLS proved the highest sensitivity relative to the other models.

TI  - STUDY OF LONG-TERM CLINICAL AND PATHOGENETIC EFFECTS OF FAVIPIRAVIR-BASED ANTI-VIRAL DRUG IN PATIENTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME IN POST-COVID PERIOD
T2  - PHARMACY & PHARMACOLOGY-FARMATSIYA I FARMAKOLOGIYA
AB  - The article presents modern scientific data on long-term clinical and pathogenetic effects of the antiviral drug Areplivir (Favipiravir) in patients with metabolic syndrome in the post-COVID period.The aim of the article is to study long-term cytokine-mediated (IL-6/sIL6r and LIF/sLIFr) pathogenetic effects of the favipiravir (Areplivir (R)) based drug on the incidence of complications in patients with metabolic syndrome in the post-COVID period.Material and methods. With the approval of the local ethics committee at the N.P. Ogarevs Mordovia State University (Protocol No. 5 dated May 17, 2020) "An open prospective comparative study of the Areplivir (R) (Favipiravir) drug effectiveness in reducing the risk of complications in the post-COVID period in patients with metabolic syndrome" in the Republic of Mordovia was carried out. The study included 190 metabolic syndrome patients who received the outpatient treatment for COVID-19 at Saransk polyclinics from February 2021 to March 2021. The case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in accordance with the current Temporary Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection.Results. The analysis of the metabolic syndrome patients' follow-up within 1 year after undergoing COVID-19, revealed significant differences in the incidence of complications depending on the intake of the favipiravir based drug. The patients who were administrated with favipiravir at the early stage of infection, were characterized by lower serum levels of four members of the interleukin 6 family - IL-6 (IL-6, sIL6r and LIF, sLIFr) 10, 30 and 180 days after a clinical and laboratory recovery (p<0.001). The average statistical changes in the IL-6 /sIL6r system of the group administrated with favipiravir, were 90%, and they were higher than in the group not administrated with antiviral drugs. In the group of the patients administrated with favipiravir, there was a significant (p<0.001) positive dynamic of the sLIFr indicator, while in the comparison group, there was an increase in this indicator. A protective effect of the early favipiravir use was characterized by a decrease in the frequency of cardiovascular complications, a 2.66-fold decrease in the risk of a stroke and the ACS in the post-COVID period.Conclusion. The areplivir therapy in the acute period of coronavirus infection made it possible to timely reduce the viral load. It helps to correct the pro-inflammatory vector of the immune response at the post-COVID stage and, accordingly, reduces the risk of progression of atherosclerosis, transient cerebrovascular accidents with a cognitive decline, an endothelial dysfunction, and can be considered a secondary prevention of life-threatening cardiovascular complications.

TI  - Intravenous high dose vitamin C and selected antiviral drugs in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a descriptive cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB  - Introduction: There is lack of universal agreement on the management of COVID-19. Intravenous high dose vitamin C (HDVC), remdesivir (RDV), and favipiravir (FPV) have been suggested as part of the treatment regimens and only RDV is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so far. There is no study in Lebanon that addresses the descriptive cohort of HDVC and antiviral therapy amongst COVID-19 inpatients. Our goal was to highlight such a cohort. Methodology: A retrospective electronic chart review of COVID-19 inpatients was done over a period of 10 months (August 2020 to April 2021). Comparative data analysis was performed between HDVC and non-HDVC (NHDVC) groups, and RDV and FPV groups. Results: Among HDVC patients, 70.1% (p = 0.035) and 67.2% (p = 0.008) had dyspnea and desaturation respectively. Patients on HDVC were less likely to remain in hospital for more than 20 days (p = 0.003). HDVC patients were more likely to be on oxygen therapy with 74.7% (p = 0.002). RDV patients were more likely to be on other COVID-19-related medications during hospitalization including the use of tofacitinib, baricitinib, tocilizumab, and anticoagulation as recommended in the guidelines. Statistical significance was noted for the status on discharge as 90.1% of the patients that received RDV were discharged after clinical improvement, compared to the 74.2% of the FPV patients. Conclusions: Further research is needed to establish local guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19. A significant role of HDVC and FPV might resurface if randomized control trials are conducted.

TI  - Effects of Drugs Formerly Proposed for COVID-19 Treatment on Connexin43 Hemichannels
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannels form a pathway for cellular communication between the cell and its extracellular environment. Under pathological conditions, Cx43 hemichannels release adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which triggers inflammation. Over the past two years, azithromycin, chloroquine, dexamethasone, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, remdesivir, ribavirin, and ritonavir have been proposed as drugs for the treatment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is associated with prominent systemic inflammation. The current study aimed to investigate if Cx43 hemichannels, being key players in inflammation, could be affected by these drugs which were formerly designated as COVID-19 drugs. For this purpose, Cx43-transduced cells were exposed to these drugs. The effects on Cx43 hemichannel activity were assessed by measuring extracellular ATP release, while the effects at the transcriptional and translational levels were monitored by means of real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunoblot analysis, respectively. Exposure to lopinavir and ritonavir combined (4:1 ratio), as well as to remdesivir, reduced Cx43 mRNA levels. None of the tested drugs affected Cx43 protein expression.

TI  - Home Treatment of Older People with Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19): A structured Summary of a Study Protocol for a Multi-Arm Multi-Stage (MAMS) Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Tolerability of Several Experimental Treatments to Reduce the Risk of Hospitalisation or Death in outpatients aged 65 years or older (COVERAGE trial)
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Objectives: To assess the efficacy of several repurposed drugs to prevent hospitalisation or death in patients aged 65 or more with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and no criteria for hospitalisation.
   Trial design: Phase III, multi-arm (5) and multi-stage (MAMS), randomized, open-label controlled superiority trial.Participants will be randomly allocated 1:1:1:1:1 to the following strategies:
   Arm 1: Control arm
   Arms 2 to 5: Experimental treatment arms
   Planned interim analyses will be conducted at regular intervals. Their results will be reviewed by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Experimental arms may be terminated for futility, efficacy or toxicity before the end of the trial. New experimental arms may be added if new evidence suggests that other treatments should be tested.A feasibility and acceptability substudy as well as an immunological substudy will be conducted alongside the trial.
   Participants: Inclusion criteria are: 65-year-old or more; Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab; Symptoms onset within 3 days before diagnosis; No hospitalisation criteria; Signed informed consent; Health insurance.Exclusion criteria are: Inability to make an informed decision to participate (e.g.: dementia, guardianship); Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale >= 7; Long QT syndrome; QTc interval > 500 ms; Heart rate <50/min; Kalaemia >5.5 mmol/L or <3.5 mmol/L; Ongoing treatment with piperaquine, halofantrine, dasatinib, nilotinib, hydroxyzine, domperidone, citalopram, escitalopram, potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme, repaglinide, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, theophylline, pyrazinamide, warfarin; Known hypersensitivity to any of the trial drugs or to chloroquine and other 4-aminoquinolines, amodiaquine, mefloquine, glafenine, floctafenine, antrafenine, ARB; Hepatic porphyria; Liver failure (Child-Pugh stage >= B); Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)); Dialysis; Hypersentivity to lactose; Lactase deficiency; Abnormalities in galactose metabolism; Malabsorption syndrome; Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; Symptomatic hyperuricemia; Ileus; Colitis; Enterocolitis; Chronic hepatitis B virus disease.The trial is being conducted in France in the Bordeaux, Corse, Dijon, Nancy, Paris and Toulouse areas as well as in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Participants are recruited either at home, nursing homes, general practices, primary care centres or hospital outpatient consultations.
   Intervention and comparator: The four experimental treatments planned in protocol version 1.2 (April 8(th), 2020) are: (1) Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, 2 tablets BID on day 0, 2 tablets QD from day 1 to 9; (2) Imatinib 400 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9; (3) Favipiravir 200 mg, 12 tablets BID on day 0, 6 tablets BID from day 1 to 9; (4) Telmisartan 20 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9.The comparator is a complex of vitamins and trace elements (AZINC Forme et Vitalite (R)), 1 capsule BID for 10 days, for which there is no reason to believe that they are active on the virus.In protocol version 1.2 (April 8th, 2020): People in the control arm will receive a combination of vitamins and trace elements; people in the experimental arms will receive hydroxychloroquine, or favipiravir, or imatinib, or telmisartan.
   Main outcome: The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with an incidence of hospitalisation and/or death between inclusion and day 14 in each arm.
   Randomisation: Participants are randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to each arm using a web-based randomisation tool. Participants not treated with an ARB or ACEI prior to enrolment are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the four experimental drugs. Participants already treated with an ARB or ACEI are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the experimental drugs except telmisartan (i.e.: hydroxychloroquine, imatinib, or favipiravir). Randomisation is stratified on ACEI or ARBs treatment at inclusion and on the type of residence (personal home vs. nursing home).
   Blinding (masking): This is an open-label trial. Participants, caregivers, investigators and statisticians are not blinded to group assignment.
   Numbers to be randomised (sample size): A total of 1057 participants will be enrolled if all arms are maintained until the final analysis and no additional arm is added.
   Three successive futility interim analyses are planned, when the number of participants reaches 30, 60 and 102 in the control arm. Two efficacy analyses (interim n degrees 3 and final) will be performed successively.
   Trial Status: This describes the Version 1.2 (April 8(th), 2020) of the COVERAGE protocol that was approved by the French regulatory authority and ethics committee. The trial was opened for enrolment on April 15(th), 2020 in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region (South-West France). Given the current decline of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and its unforeseeable dynamic in the coming months, new trial sites in 5 other French regions and in Luxembourg are currently being opened. A revised version of the protocol was submitted to the regulatory authority and ethics committee on June 15(th), 2020. It contains the following amendments: (i) Inclusion criteria: age >= 65 replaced by age >= 60; time since first symptoms <3 days replaced by time since first symptoms <5 days; (ii) Withdrawal of the hydroxychloroquine arm (due to external data); (iii) increase in the number of trial sites.
   Trial registration: The trial was registered on Clinical Trials.gov on April 22(nd), 2020 (Identifier: NCT04356495): and on EudraCT on April 10(th), 2020 (Identifier: 2020-001435-27).
   Full protocol: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest of expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol. The study protocol has been reported in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Clinical Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (Additional file 2).

TI  - Environmental and ecotoxicological effects of drugs used for the treatment of COVID 19
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Consumption of different pharmaceuticals has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic. Some health institutions worldwide approved the use of drugs such as ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, dexamethasone, favipiravir, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, chloroquine, dexamethasone for the treatment of the virus. Once consumed by humans, these compounds are released in urine and faeces, ending up in wastewater and conducted to treatment plants or directly discharged without prior treatment into surface water and soil, with minimum values recorded between 7 ng/L and < 0.08 mu g/L for azithromycin and ivermectin respectively, as well as dexamethasone with 0.73 ng/L in surface water and an average of 50-60 ng/L for favipiravir. Their presence has numerous toxicological effects on aquatic and terrestrial species, influencing population decline and altering the growth of organisms. However, the environmental consequences of pharmaceuticals in the environment are poorly known, especially for antivirals studied in this article. This work aims to analyze the presence, treatment and ecotoxicity of drugs used in the pandemic COVID 19, mainly focusing on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems since that is where they arrive through wastewater. Ecotoxicological effects on flora, fauna and humans are also analyzed. Once there, they persist in the environment causing severe ecological damage, developmental and growth disorders in animals and plants and, in many cases, even the death of species.

TI  - ESCMID COVID-19 living guidelines: drug treatment and clinical management
T2  - CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - Scope: In January 2021, the ESCMID Executive Committee decided to launch a new initiative to develop ESCMID guidelines on several COVID-19-related issues, including treatment of COVID-19.
   Methods: An ESCMID COVID-19 guidelines task force was established by the ESCMID Executive Committee. A small group was established, half appointed by the chair, and the remaining selected with an open call. Each panel met virtually once a week. For all decisions, a simple majority vote was used. A long list of clinical questions using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) format was developed at the beginning of the process. For each PICO, two panel members performed a literature search with a third panellist involved in case of inconsistent results. Voting was based on the GRADE approach.
   Questions addressed by the guideline and recommendations: A synthesis of the available evidence and recommendations is provided for each of the 15 PICOs, which cover use of hydroxychloroquine, bamlanivimab alone or in combination with etesevimab, casirivimab combined with imdevimab, ivermectin, azithromycin and empirical antibiotics, colchicine, corticosteroids, convalescent plasma, favipiravir, remdesivir, tocilizumab and interferon beta-1a, as well as the utility of antifungal prophylaxis and enoxaparin. In general, the panel recommended against the use of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin, colchicine and interferon beta-1a. Conditional recommendations were given for the use of monoclonal antibodies in high-risk outpatients with mild-moderate COVID-19, and remdesivir. There was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for use of favipiravir and antifungal prophylaxis, and it was recommended that antibiotics should not be routinely prescribed in patients with COVID-19 unless bacterial coinfection or secondary infection is suspected or confirmed. Tocilizumab and corticosteroids were recommended for treatment of severe COVID-19 but not in outpatients with non-severe COVID-19.
   Scope: The aim of the present guidance is to provide evidence-based recommendations for management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More specifically, the goal is to aid clinicians managing patients with COVID-19 at various levels of severity including outpatients, hospitalized patients, and those admitted to intensive care unit. Considering the composition of the panel, mostly clinical microbiologists or infectious disease specialists with no pulmonology or intensive care background, we focus only on pharmacological treatment and do not give recommendations on oxygen supplement/support. Similarly, as no paediatricians were included in the panel; the recommendations are only for adult patients with COVID-19. Considering the current literature, no guidance was given for special populations such as the immunocompromised. (C) 2021 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

TI  - Experience of Rwanda on COVID-19 Case Management: From Uncertainties to the Era of Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The management of COVID-19 in Rwanda has been dynamic, and the use of COVID-19 therapeutics has gradually been updated based on scientific discoveries. The treatment for COVID-19 remained patient-centered and entirely state-sponsored during the first and second waves. From the time of identification of the index case in March 2020 up to August 2021, three versions of the clinical management guidelines were developed, with the aim of ensuring that the COVID-19 patients treated in Rwanda were receiving care based on the most recent therapeutic discoveries. As the case load increased and imposed imminent heavy burdens on the healthcare system, a smooth transition was made to enable that the asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases could continue to be closely observed and managed while they remained in their homes. The care provided to patients requiring facility-based interventions mainly focused on the provision of anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulation, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, management of hyperglycemia and the provision of therapeutics with a direct antiviral effect such as favipiravir and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The time to viral clearance was observed to be shortest among eligible patients treated with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bamlanivimab). Moving forward, as we strive to continue detecting COVID-19 cases as early as possible, and promptly initiate supportive interventions, the use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies constitutes an attractive and cost-effective therapeutic approach. If this approach is used strategically along with other measures in place (i.e., COVID-19 vaccine roll out, etc.), it will enable us to bring this global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic under full control and with a low case fatality rate.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Tokyo: a single-center observational study from the first wave
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundMany studies have been published about critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the early phases of the pandemic but the characteristic or survival of critically ill Japanese patients have not yet been investigated. We sought to investigate the characteristics, inflammatory laboratory finding trends, and outcomes among critically ill Japanese patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with the first wave of COVID-19.MethodsA retrospective observational study was performed in a single institution in the center of Tokyo. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from March 19 to April 30, 2020 were included. Trends for significant inflammatory laboratory findings were analyzed. In-hospital death, days of mechanical ventilation or oxygen supplementation, days of ICU or hospital stay were followed until May 26, 2020.ResultsTwenty-four patients were included. Median age was 57.5years, and 79% were male. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was elevated to a median of 10.1 on admission and peaked on Day 10 of illness. Seventeen patients were intubated on Day 11 of illness and received mechanical ventilation. One patient underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The majority (88%) received systemic steroids, including 16 patients who received high dose methylprednisolone (500-1000mg). Favipiravir was used in 38% of patients. Two patients, including 1 who refused intensive care, died. Eighteen patients were discharged. Median length of ICU and hospital stay for all patients was 6 and 22days, respectively. Median length of ventilator dependency was 7days. Four patients underwent a tracheostomy and received prolonged ventilation for more than 21days. One patient receiving mechanical ventilation died. All survivors discontinued ventilator use.ConclusionsMortality was remarkably low in our single institutional study. Three survivors received mechanical ventilation for more than 3weeks. Trends of clinically significant laboratory markers reflected the clinical course of COVID-19.

TI  - Favipiravir Experience in COVID-19 Patients at a Tertiary Center Intensive Care Unit
T2  - MEDICAL BULLETIN OF SISLI ETFAL HOSPITAL
AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare intensive care unit (ICU) and overall hospital mortality in patients treated with favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir for COVID-19.
   Methods: Data were collected retrospectively between March 10 and May 10, 2020, from patients' records admitted to ICU due to COVID-19. Laboratory data, clinical characteristics, KU and hospital mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay were compared in patients treated with favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir.
   Results: A total of 100 patients' data were investigated. Favipiravir was used as the treatment for 85% of patients, with the rest treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. Clinical and laboratory data of both antiviral treatment groups were similar. Length of hospital stay was 16 (9-24) days with favipiravir and 8.5 (5-12.5) days with lopinavir-ritonavir (p=0.002). Length of ICU stay for favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir groups were 8 (5-15) days and 4 (3-9) days, respectively (p=0.011). ICU mortality was 65.9% for the favipiravir and 80% for lopinavir-ritonavir (p=0.002). Hospital mortality for favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir was 67.1% and 80%, respectively (p=0.001).
   Conclusion: The mortality in patients treated with favipiravir was less than patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. Favipiravir needs more attention and trials for its effect to be confirmed.

TI  - Marburg virus disease: A deadly rare virus is coming
T2  - BIOSCIENCE TRENDS
AB  - Two cases of the deadly Marburgvirus were reported in Ghana, which might be a new global virus alert following COVID-19 and novel monkeypox. Thus far, there is no vaccine or treatment for Marburg virus disease, which is a disease with a mortality rate as high as that of Ebola. Although now human infections with Marburgvirus occurred mainly in Africa, outbreaks were twice reported in Europe over the past 55 years. A concern is that globalization might promote its global viral transmission, just like what happened with COVID-19. The current study has briefly summarized the etiology, epidemiology, and clinical symptoms of the Marburgvirus as well as vaccine development and experimental treatments in order to prevent and control this virus.

TI  - FDA approved drugs with pharmacotherapeutic potential for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) therapy
T2  - DRUG RESISTANCE UPDATES
AB  - In December 2019, a novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged, causing an outbreak of life-threatening pneumonia in the Hubei province, China, and has now spread worldwide, causing a pandemic. The urgent need to control the disease, combined with the lack of specific and effective treatment modalities, call for the use of FDAapproved agents that have shown efficacy against similar pathogens. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin have all been successful in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The initial results of a number of clinical trials involving various protocols of administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine mostly point towards their beneficial effect. However, they may not be effective in cases with persistently high viremia, while results on ivermectin (another antiparasitic agent) are not yet available. Interestingly, azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic in combination with hydroxychloroquine, might yield clinical benefit as an adjunctive. The results of clinical trials point to the potential clinical efficacy of antivirals, especially remdesivir (GS-5734), lopinavir/ ritonavir, and favipiravir. Other therapeutic options that are being explored involve meplazumab, tocilizumab, and interferon type 1. We discuss a number of other drugs that are currently in clinical trials, whose results are not yet available, and in various instances we enrich such efficacy analysis by invoking historic data on the treatment of SARS, MERS, influenza, or in vitro studies. Meanwhile, scientists worldwide are seeking to discover novel drugs that take advantage of the molecular structure of the virus, its intracellular life cycle that probably elucidates unfolded-protein response, as well as its mechanism of surface binding and cell invasion, like angiotensin converting enzymes-, HR1, and metalloproteinase inhibitors.

TI  - ASSESSEMENT OF OUTCOMES FOLLOWING IMPLEMENTATION OF ANTIVIRAL TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR COVID-19 DURING THE FIRST WAVE IN THAILAND
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Thailand encountered its first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in March 2020 and the Thailand Ministry of Public Health rapidly developed COVID-19 treatment guidelines. In this study we aimed to describe the outcomes among patients treated following those initial guidelines and determine factors significantly associated with poor outcomes in order to inform efforts to improve COVID-19 treatment guidelines for Thailand. Nine hospitals in Bangkok submitted data from their COVID-19 patients using standardized case record forms. A poor outcome was defined as death, ICU admission, requiring intubation or requiring high-flow oxygen. Factors associated with these outcomes were assessed. A total of 744 patients (48.8% male) were included in the study. The median (interquartile range) age of study subjects was 37 (27-48) years; 8.4% were aged >60 years, 5.6% of subjects were obese and 16.5% had underlying conditions: obesity, immunocompromised status, diabetes, chronic conditions of lungs, kidneys, liver, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular systems or had an absolute lymphocyte count <1,000 cells/mm 3 . Among symptomatic patients, factors significantly independently associated with a poor outcome were: age >60 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.50, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-5.36, p = 0.018), having an underlying risk condition (aOR: 2.36, 95%CI: 1.27-4.39, p = 0.007), presenting with pneumonia (aOR: 6.60, 95%CI: 3.48-12.49, p <0.001) and azithromycin use (aOR: 2.36, 95%CI: 1.30-4.31, p = 0.005). Among symptomatic patients, the factor significantly associated with lower odds of having a poor outcome was hospital admission within 4 days of symptom onset (aOR: 0.44, 95%CI: 0.24-0.82, p = 0.009). Subgroup analysis revealed hospital admission within 4 days of symptom onset was significantly associated with a lower risk of a poor outcome only among patients who received treatment that included favipiravir (crude odds ratio (cOR): 0.320, 95%CI: 0.152-0.662, p = 0.003), but not among those who received a ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor (lopinavir or darunavir) or hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine) without favipiravir (cOR: 0.58, 95%CI: 0.18-1.91, p = 0.372). In summary, the factors significantly associated with greater odds of having a poorer outcome were: age >60 years, having an underlying risk condition, presenting with pneumonia and azithromycin use; and with lower odds of having a poor outcome was being treated with favipiravir within 4 days of symptom onset. Thai guidelines have been updated to include early initiation of favipiravir, particularly among those with underlying risk conditions. Further studies are needed to determine if implementation of guidelines taking into account of all these factors will result in improved outcomes.

TI  - Novel favipiravir pattern-based learning model for automated detection of specific language impairment disorder using vowels
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB  - Specific language impairment (SLI) is one of the most common diseases in children, and early diagnosis can help to obtain better timely therapy economically. It is difficult and time-consuming for clinicians to accurately detect SLI through standard clinical assessments. Hence, machine learning algorithms have been developed to assist in the accurate diagnosis of SLI. This work aims to investigate the graph of the favipiravir molecule-based feature extraction function and propose an accurate SLI detection model using vowels. We proposed a novel handcrafted machine learning framework. This architecture comprises the favipiravir molecular structure pattern, statistical feature extractor, wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), iterative neighborhood component analysis (INCA), and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Two feature extraction models, statistical and textural, are employed in the handcrafted feature generation methodology. A new nature-inspired graph-based feature extractor that uses the chemical depiction of the favipiravir (favipiravir became popular with the COVID-19 pandemic) is employed for feature extraction. Finally, the proposed favipiravir pattern, statistical feature extractor, and wavelet packet decomposition are used to create a feature vector. Moreover, a statistical feature extractor is used in this work. The WPD generates multilevel features, and the most meaningful features are selected using the NCA feature selector. Finally, these chosen features are fed to SVM classifier for automated classification. Two validation methods, (i) leave one subject out (LOSO) and (ii) tenfold cross-validations (CV), are used to obtain robust classification results. Our proposed favipiravir pattern-based model developed using a vowel dataset can detect SLI children with an accuracy of 99.87% and 98.86% using tenfold and LOSO CV strategies, respectively. These results demonstrated the high vowel classification ability of the proposed favipiravir pattern-based model.

TI  - Phytochemicals from Plant Foods as Potential Source of Antiviral Agents: An Overview
T2  - PHARMACEUTICALS
AB  - To date, the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide include viral infections, such as Ebola, influenza virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and recently COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently, we can count on a narrow range of antiviral drugs, especially older generation ones like ribavirin and interferon which are effective against viruses in vitro but can often be ineffective in patients. In addition to these, we have antiviral agents for the treatment of herpes virus, influenza virus, HIV and hepatitis virus. Recently, drugs used in the past especially against ebolavirus, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, have been considered for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. However, even if these drugs represent important tools against viral diseases, they are certainly not sufficient to defend us from the multitude of viruses present in the environment. This represents a huge problem, especially considering the unprecedented global threat due to the advancement of COVID-19, which represents a potential risk to the health and life of millions of people. The demand, therefore, for new and effective antiviral drugs is very high. This review focuses on three fundamental points: (1) presents the main threats to human health, reviewing the most widespread viral diseases in the world, thus describing the scenario caused by the disease in question each time and evaluating the specific therapeutic remedies currently available. (2) It comprehensively describes main phytochemical classes, in particular from plant foods, with proven antiviral activities, the viruses potentially treated with the described phytochemicals. (3) Consideration of the various applications of drug delivery systems in order to improve the bioavailability of these compounds or extracts. A PRISMA flow diagram was used for the inclusion of the works. Taking into consideration the recent dramatic events caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the cry of alarm that denounces critical need for new antiviral drugs is extremely strong. For these reasons, a continuous systematic exploration of plant foods and their phytochemicals is necessary for the development of new antiviral agents capable of saving lives and improving their well-being.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic characterization of favipiravir in patients with COVID-19
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - This prospective observational study describes the pharmacokinetic characteristics of favipiravir in adult patients hospitalized for mild to moderate COVID-19 with a positive RT-PCR test. Favipiravir was administered for 5 days, with a loading dose of 3200 mg and a maintenance dose of 1200 mg/day. Serial blood samples were collected on Day 2 and Day 4 of the therapy. Laboratory findings of the patients (n = 21) and in-hospital mortality were recorded. Favipiravir concentrations exhibited substantial variability and a significant decrease during the treatment of COVID-19. The median favipiravir trough concentration (C0-trough) on Day 2 was 21.26 (interquartile range [IQR], 8.37-30.78) mu g/mL, whereas it decreased significantly to 1.61 (IQR, 0.00-6.41) mu g/mL on Day 4, the area under the concentration-time curve decreased by 68.5%. Day 2 C0-trough of female patients was higher than male patients. Our findings indicate that favipiravir concentrations show significant variability during the treatment of COVID-19 and therapeutic drug monitoring may be necessary to maintain targeted concentrations.

TI  - Novel environment friendly TLC-densitometric method for the determination of anti-coronavirus drugs "Remdesivir and Favipiravir": Green assessment with application to pharmaceutical formulations and human plasma
T2  - MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB  - A great demand for discovering new therapeutic solutions has been considered all over the world for managing the rapidly progressing COVID-19 pandemic. Remdesivir (REM) and Favipiravir (FAV) are introduced as promising newly developed antiviral agents against the corona virus as evidenced by the clinical findings. Hence, the optimization of an analytical method for their simultaneous determination acquires potential importance in quality control labs and further confirmatory investigations. Herein, a green, sensitive, and selective densitometric method has been proposed and validated for determination of REM and FAV in pharmaceutical formulations and spiked human plasma on normal phase TLC plates. A solvent mixture of ethyl acetate-methanolammonia (8:2:0.2 by volume) has been chosen as developing mobile phase system. Well resolved spots have been detected at 235 nm with retardation factors (Rf) of 0.18 and 0.98 for REM and FAV, respectively. A validation study has been carried out in the light of ICH guidelines. Remdesivir and FAV have shown excellent sensitivities with quantitation limits down to 0.12 and 0.07 mu g/band, respectively. The developed method has been successfully applied to tablet formulations and spiked plasma with excellent recoveries ranged from 97.21 to 101.31%. The greenness of the method has been evaluated using the standards of greenness profile and EcoScale. It has passed the four greenness profile quadrants and achieved 80 score in Eco-Scale.

TI  - Pulmonary Delivery of Favipiravir in Rats Reaches High Local Concentrations without Causing Oxidative Lung Injury or Systemic Side Effects
T2  - PHARMACEUTICS
AB  - Favipiravir displays a rapid viral clearance, a high recovery rate and broad therapeutic safety; however, its oral administration was associated with systemic side effects in susceptible patients. Considering that the pulmonary route could provide a high drug concentration, and a safer application with less absorption into systemic circulation, it was aimed to elucidate whether favipiravir delivered via soft-mist inhaler has any deleterious effects on lung, liver and kidney tissues of healthy rats. Wistar albino rats of both sexes (n = 72) were placed in restrainers, and were given either saline or favipiravir (1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg in 1 mL saline) by inhalation within 2 min for 5 consecutive days. On the 6th day, electrocardiographic recording was obtained, and cardiac blood and lung tissues were collected. Favipiravir did not alter cardiac rhythm, blood cell counts, serum levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urea or uric acid, and did not cause any significant changes in the pulmonary malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase activity or antioxidant glutathione levels. Our data revealed that pulmonary use of favipiravir via soft-mist inhaler enables a high local concentration compared to plasma without oxidative lung injury or cardiac or hepatorenal dysfunction.

TI  - Favipiravir biotransformation in liver cytosol: Species and sex differences in humans, monkeys, rats, and mice
T2  - BIOPHARMACEUTICS & DRUG DISPOSITION
AB  - Favipiravir is an antiviral agent effective against several RNA viruses that is converted into an inactive oxidative metabolite (M1), mainly by aldehyde oxidase, in humans. In the present study, the biotransformation of favipiravir into M1 in male and female humans, monkeys, rats, and mice was examined in an in vitro system using liver cytosolic fractions. The kinetics for M1 formation followed the Michaelis-Menten model in all species. The K-m, V-max, and CLint values in humans were 602 mu M, 466 pmol/min/mg protein, and 776 nl/min/mg protein in males, respectively, and 713 mu M, 404 pmol/min/mg protein, and 567 nl/min/mg protein in females, respectively. Species differences in CLint values were monkeys > humans > mice > rats in both males and females, and the variations for males and females were 120- and 96-fold, respectively. Sex differences in CLint values were males > females in humans and mice, females > males in monkeys and rats, and marked variation (4.3-fold) was noted in mice. This suggests that the roles of aldehyde oxidase in the hepatic metabolism of favipiravir differ extensively depending on the species and sex, and this study will aid in the assessment of the antiviral activities of favipiravir against novel and/or variant viruses.

TI  - Therapeutic Strategies in the Management of COVID-19
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB  - Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), novel corona virus has caused pandemic globally, with rise in the number of cases and death of the patients. Vast majority of the countries that are dealing with rise in the active cases and death of patients suffering from novel corona viruses COVID-19 are trying to content the virus by isolating the patients and treating them with the approved antiviral that have been previously used in treating SARS, MERS, and drugs that are used to treat other viral infections. Some of these are under clinical trials. At present there are no therapeutically effective antiviral present and there are no vaccines or drugs available that are clinically approved for treating the corona virus. The current strategy is to re-purpose the available drugs or antiviral that can minimise or reduce the burden of the health care emergencies. In this article the reuse of antiviral, US-FDA approved drugs, plant based therapeutic, anti-malarial, anti-parasitic, anti-HIV drugs and the traditional medicines that are being currently used in treating the symptoms of COVID-19 patients is discussed emphasis is also given on the treatment using monoclonal antibodies. The present article provides the therapeutic strategies that will qualify as one of the best available treatment for the better management of the COVID-19 patients in order to achieve medical benefits.

TI  - A Case of Autosomal Recessive Interferon Alpha/Beta Receptor Alpha Chain (IFNAR1) Deficiency with Severe COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Background Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in antiviral immunity. Genetic defects in interferon receptors, IFNs, and auto-antibodies against IFNs can lead to the development of life-threatening forms of infectious diseases like a severe form of COVID-19. Case Presentation A 13-year-old boy with a previously reported homozygous loss-of-function mutation in interferon alpha/beta receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) (c.674-2A > G) was diagnosed with severe COVID-19. He had cold symptoms and a high-grade fever at the time of admission. He was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit after showing no response to favipiravir and being hypoxemic. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning revealed lung involvement of 70% with extensive areas of consolidation in both lungs. Antibiotics, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), remdesivir, methylprednisolone pulse, and other medications were started in the patient. However, remdesivir and methylprednisolone pulse were discontinued because of their adverse side effects in the patient. His general condition improved, and a few days later was discharged from the hospital. Conclusion We reported a patient with severe COVID-19 who had a mutation in IFNAR1. Our finding suggests that patients with IFNAR1 deficiency are prone to severe forms of COVID-19. Besides, IFN-gamma therapy may be a potential drug to treat patients with defects in IFN-alpha/beta signaling pathways which needs further investigations.

TI  - A novel stability-indicating HPLC-DAD method for determination of favipiravir, a potential antiviral drug for COVID-19 treatment; application to degradation kinetic studies and in-vitro dissolution profiling
T2  - MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Modern pharmaceutical analysis is paying a lot of attention to the stability of novel drug formulations as well as establishment of suitable stability-indicating approaches. In the current work, a comprehensive stabilityindicating HPLC-DAD method has been developed and validated for determination of favipiravir (FAV) which is a novel and emerging antiviral option in COVID-19 treatment. The stability of FAV was examined under different stress conditions. FAV was found to be susceptible to acid, base hydrolysis and oxidative degradation. Structure elucidation of the forced degradation products was carried out using mass spectrometry (MS) operated in electrospray ionization mode. Effective separation of FAV and its induced degradation products was achieved using isocratic elution mode on Zorbax C18 column maintained at 30 degrees C. The mobile phase used was comprised of 25.0 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3.5 +/- 0.05) containing 0.1% (w/v) heptane sulphonic acid sodium salt-methanol-acetonitrile (62:28:10, by volume), delivered at flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The diode array detector signal for FAV was monitored at 321.0 nm over a concentration range of 6.25-250.00 mu g/mL. The potential mechanisms for generation of degradation products were postulated through comparison of MS1 fragmentation pattern of FAV and its degradation products. Moreover, the proposed method was also extended to study the degradation kinetics. Additionally, dissolution profiling of FAV in different media was monitored. Clearly, the suggested approach is accurate, reliable, time-saving, and cost-effective. As a result, it may be utilized for regular quality control and stability assessment of FAV in its tablet dosage form.

TI  - The effect of Favipiravir on liver enzyme among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection: A prospective cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF POPULATION THERAPEUTICS AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Teratogenicity and hyperuricemia are considered as the major adverse effects of favipiravir, but less is known about other possible side effects which includes drug-induced liver damage and renal injury. In the current research, assessment of favipiravir-induced liver injury was performed by evaluating liver enzymes among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection. A prospective cohort study was conducted on 66 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection who were treated with favipiravir for 5 days. During this period, a baseline assessment of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase - AST, ala-nine transaminase - ALT and alkaline phosphatase - ALP) in addition to bilirubin before initiation of ther-apy and after 1 day of completion of therapy were carried out. The comparison of all measured parameters among all patients before and after receiving the treatment showed that non-significant differences were obtained in their levels. It was noticed that COVID-19 patients demonstrated high AST levels in which only 16 patients out of the all-subjected cases (66 patients) had AST levels of less than 45 U/L whereas the major-ity of patients showed normal ALT, ALP, and bilirubin levels. It was concluded that 5 days administration of favipiravir in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients who had no previous liver diseases did not affect the liver enzymes significantly and only transient elevations were occurred.

TI  - PMX-DHP Therapy for Dyspnea and Deoxygenation in Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Case Series
T2  - INFECTION AND DRUG RESISTANCE
AB  - Hypercytokinemia induced by coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is associated with severe pulmonary involvement, which may lead to respiratory failure. These conditions play an important role in the worsening of clinical symptoms in patients with severe COVID-19. There is no established treatment for hypercytokinemia. We report on two patients whose clinical symptoms improved after direct hemoperfusion using polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column (PMX-DHP), following the administration of the anti-inflammatory agent tocilizumab. Case A was a 70-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite treatment with ciclesonide and favipiravir, supplemental oxygen was administered due to the worsening of dyspnea with tachypnea. Although tocilizumab was started on day 6, the patient deteriorated into deoxygenation, presenting with the PaO2/FIO2 (P/F) ratio of 92. On days 8 and 10, the patient received PMX-DHP therapy. On day 11, his dyspnea improved. On day 13, his P/F ratio began to improve, and oxygen therapy was discontinued on day 18. The patient recovered without requiring mechanical ventilation. Case B was a 70-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with favipiravir, starting on day 0. Despite starting ciclesonide inhalation and tocilizumab on day 2, his P/F ratio was 53. On day 5, he received PMX-DHP therapy. On day 6, his dyspnea improved, as did his P/F ratio, reaching 81 on day 8. Finally, his clinical symptoms resolved, and he was discharged from the intensive care unit without requiring mechanical ventilation. These cases indicate that PMX-DHP therapy might be a suitable treatment option for dyspnea and deoxygenation in COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in cases where an anti-inflammatory agent, such as tocilizumab, has failed to achieve the desired effect.

TI  - Novel Coronavirus Polymerase and Nucleotidyl-Transferase Structures: Potential to Target New Outbreaks
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB  - The pandemic outbreak of a new coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV-2, has captured the world's attention, demonstrating that CoVs represent a continuous global threat. As this is a highly contagious virus, it is imperative to understand RNA-dependent-RNApolymerase (RdRp), the key component in virus replication. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome shares 80% sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV, their RdRps and nucleotidyl-transferases (NiRAN) share 98.1% and 93.2% identity, respectively. Sequence alignment of six coronaviruses demonstrated higher identity among their RdRps (60.9%-98.1%) and lower identity among their Spike proteins (27%-77%). Thus, a 3D structural model of RdRp, NiRAN, non-structural protein 7 (nsp7), and nsp8 of SARS-CoV-2 was generated by modeling starting from the SARS counterpart structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the binding poses of three viral RdRp inhibitors (Galidesivir, Favipiravir, and Penciclovir), which were recently reported to have clinical significance for SARS-CoV-2. The network of interactions established by these drug molecules affirms their efficacy to inhibit viral RNA replication and provides an insight into their structure-based rational optimization for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.

TI  - The Saudi Critical Care Society practice guidelines on the management of COVID-19 in the ICU: Therapy section
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: The rapid increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases during the subsequent waves in Saudi Arabia and other countries prompted the Saudi Critical Care Society (SCCS) to put together a panel of experts to issue evidence-based recommendations for the management of COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU).Methods: The SCCS COVID-19 panel included 51 experts with expertise in critical care, respirology, infectious disease, epidemiology, emergency medicine, clinical pharmacy, nursing, respiratory therapy, methodology, and health policy. All members completed an electronic conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel addressed 9 questions that are related to the therapy of COVID-19 in the ICU. We identified relevant systematic reviews and clinical trials, then used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach as well as the evidence-to-decision framework (EtD) to assess the quality of evidence and generate recommendations.Results: The SCCS COVID-19 panel issued 12 recommendations on pharmacotherapeutic interventions (immunomodulators, antiviral agents, and anticoagulants) for severe and critical COVID-19, of which 3 were strong recommendations and 9 were weak recommendations. Conclusion: The SCCS COVID-19 panel used the GRADE approach to formulate recommendations on therapy for COVID-19 in the ICU. The EtD framework allows adaptation of these recommendations in different contexts. The SCCS guideline committee will update recommendations as new evidence becomes available.(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences.

TI  - Integrative management of critical case of Covid 19 with Ayurveda and modern medicine: A case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF AYURVEDA AND INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Covid 19 pandemic has placed challenges in front of medical health fraternity in terms of management, prevention and immunity building. Effectiveness of any medication has not conclusively proven; hence there is need for integrative management of Covid 19. We have managed a critical case of Covid-19 having history of thalassemia, hypothyroidism with integrative management of Ayurveda and modern medicine. A male patient (59 years of age) with history of thalassemia had complaints of cough and breathlessness since 4 days. He performed RT PCR because of his exposure to a Covid positive cases in immediate family. He was treated with Favipiravir at home for 5 days. He deteriorated on 6th day with SPO2 dropped to 75%, temp raised to 101 F and respiratory rate (RR) raised to 45/min. He was admitted in Yogeshwari Hospital Daund, Maharashtra; treated with oxygen inhalation, Remdesvir and Ayurveda medicines in intensive care unit (ICU). Ayurveda treatment protocol was advised through telemedicine. Significant improvement in clinical symptoms and normal HRCT was observed at completion of treatment. This case report provides further directions for integrative management in cases of Covid 19. Further clinical research studies in this direction are warranted. (c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia: Can we predict the response to treatment?
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB  - Introduction: Early experience with favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 is promising, but no clinical data have been published in medical journals. This study aimed to review the experience with favipiravir treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia and to examine whether there are any predictors of treatment response. Methodology: Fifty-six patients with severe or progressive pneumonia associated with COVID-19 who were treated with favipiravir monotherapy for at least five days were included in this retrospective study. Treatment response was defined as clinical recovery without any need for admission into the intensive care unit and/or anti-cytokine therapy. The demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic features of the patients were compared between favipiravir-responders and non-responders. Results: Of the 56 patients, 34 patients (60.7%) responded to treatment and recovered. There was no difference in the demographic, clinical, and radiographic findings between the responders and non-responders. The inflammatory biomarkers were also similar except for the CRP levels on the day favipiravir was started [74 (36-111) vs. 118.5 (46.5-203) mg/L, respectively, p = 0.043]. There was also a significant difference in the median time to defervescence [1 (1-2) vs. 3.5 (1.75-9.25) days, respectively]. Of clinical interest, 27 (79.4%) and 31 (91.2%) of the responders became afebrile within two and four days, respectively. The response rate was lower in patients who presented severe pneumonia associated with respiratory failure. Conclusions: Patients with non-severe pneumonia at admission and whose fever resolved within two days of treatment are more likely to improve with favipiravir.

TI  - Assessment of Retinal Neurodegeneration and Choroidal Thickness in COVID-19 Patients Using Swept-Source OCT Technology
T2  - KLINISCHE MONATSBLATTER FUR AUGENHEILKUNDE
AB  - Purpose To analyze the central macular thickness (CMT), retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), ganglion cell layer thickness (GCLT), and choroidal thickness (ChT) measurements in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
   Methods The study was conducted cross-sectionally 4 weeks after the completed treatment of COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the polymerase chain reaction test and/or clinical and radiological findings. The patients with treated COVID-19 were enrolled in the COVID-19 group; age- and sex-matched healthy participants served as the control group. All patients in the COVID-19 group were hospitalized and treated with favipiravir, moxifloxacin, and heparin without the requirement for intubation. The measurements of CMT, RNFLT (in four quadrants), GCLT (in six sectors of two different boundaries), and ChT (in five locations) were performed by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).
   Results Similar visual acuity (p = 0.582) and intraocular pressure (p = 0.766) values were observed between the COVID-19 and control groups. Regarding SS-OCT measurements, all mean CMT, RNFLT (in four quadrants), GCLT (in six sectors of two different boundaries), and ChT (in five locations) values were similar in the COVID-19 and control groups (p > 0.05 for all). In the COVID-19 group, a statistically significant negative correlation was noted between the mean ferritin level and temporal RNFLT (r = - 0.378, p = 0.014) and a positive correlation was observed between the mean ferritin level and nasal RNFLT (r = + 0.371, p = 0.016).
   Conclusion SS-OCT measurements showed no retinal neurodegenerative and choroidal thickness alterations in COVID-19 patients. Nonsignificant results might be due to the examination of the patients in the early period of the COVID-19 after the treatment. Therefore, late period OCT measurements should be reviewed with new studies in the future.

TI  - Comparison of HPLC and UV Spectrophotometric Methods for Quantification of Favipiravir in Pharmaceutical Formulations
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH
AB  - There is no currently successful method to treat Covid-19 infection. Nevertheless, previously licensed pharmaceuticals to treat other virus infections are used on an off-label basis either alone or in combination. One of them is favipiravir. Favipiravir, also known as favilavir, is an antiviral drug that is active against many viruses. Spectrophotometric and liquid chromatographic methods have been developed and validated for the quantitative determination of favipiravir in pharmaceutical formulations. Chromatographic method has been performed using reverse-phase technique on a C-18 column with a mobile phase consisting of sodium acetate solution (pH adjusted to 3.0 with glacial acetic acid) and acetonitrile (85:15, v/v) at 30 oC. The mobile phase flow rate was 1.0 mL min-1. For the determination of favipiravir, UV spectrum has been recorded between 200 and 800 nm using deionized water as solvent and the wavelength of 227 nm has been selected. Both methods have been validated in terms of their specificity, linearity, limits of detection and quantification, precision, accuracy, and robustness. Both methods have demonstrated good linearity, precision and recovery. No spectral and chromatographic interferences from the tablet excipients were found in spectrophotometric and liquid chromatographic methods. In both methods, correlation coefficients were greater than 0.999 within a concentration range of 10-60 mg mL-1 using spectrophotometry and chromatography. Intra-day and inter-day precision were observed with low relative standard deviation values. The accuracy of the methods were within the range 99.57-100.10% for LC and from 99.83-100.45% for UV. Therefore, both methods gave the most reliable outcomes for the determination of favipiravir in pharmaceutical formulation.

TI  - Comparison of Liver Safety of Favipiravir and Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 Treatment
T2  - KLIMIK JOURNAL
AB  - Objective: Since the first case from Wuhan, China in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread all over the world and a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. While there are no specific effective antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat or to prevent COVID-19; favipiravir, hydroxy-chloroquine and their combination are used in the treatment of COVID-19 in Turkey. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the demographic, clinical and laboratory findings, the treatments given and the effects of treatments on liver tests of the patients followed up with the diagnosis of COVID-19.
   Methods: This study was retrospectively designed, and included COVID-19 patients who met the "definitive case" criteria in guidelines of Ministry of Health of Turkey between April 3, 2020 and September 28, 2020 in the Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology at Faculty of Medicine, Erciyes University. Age, gender, hospitalization time, comorbidities, malignancies, symptoms, disease severity, antibiotics and other medications used, laboratory and thorax computed tomography findings, and mortality rates were recorded. The patients were divided into two groups as hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir group. Both groups were evaluated in terms of clinical findings, treatment protocols and laboratory findings, particularly liver tests. Results of liver tests were recorded on the 0th, 3rd and 5th days of treatment and 48-72 hours after the end of treatment.
   Results: A total of 52 patients with COVID-19, 20 in the hydroxychloroquine group and 32 in the favipiravir group, were enrolled in study. Significant differences between two groups were not generally observed in terms of basic characteristics of patients. It was not noticed statistically significant increases in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase values in the hydroxychloroquine group, but significant increases were found in ALT (p<0.0001), LDH (p=0.01) and GGT (p<0.0001) values in favipiravir group.
   Conclusions: In addition to the need for other clinical studies to prove the definitive efficacy of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19, we think that favipiravir-induced liver damage is an important point that should not be ignored during treatment.

TI  - Role of different tautomers in the base-pairing abilities of some of the vital antiviral drugs used against COVID-19
T2  - PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB  - Repurposed drugs are now considered as attractive therapeutics against COVID-19. It is shown that Remdesivir, a nucleoside drug that was originally invented for the Ebola virus, is effective in suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Similarly, Galidesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin, N4-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931), and EIDD-2801 (a prodrug of EIDD-1931) were also found to be effective against COVID-19. However, the mechanisms of action of these drugs are not yet fully understood. For example, in some experimental studies, these drugs were proposed to act as a RNA-chain terminator, while in other studies, these were proposed to induce base-pair mutations above the error catastrophe limit to stall the replication of the viral RNA. To understand the mutagenic effects of these drugs, the role of different tautomers in their base-pairing abilities is studied here in detail by employing a reliable dispersion-corrected density functional theoretic method. It is found that Remdesivir and Galidesivir can adopt both amino and imino tautomeric conformations to base-pair with RNA bases. While the insertions of G and U are preferred against the amino tautomers of these drugs, the insertion of C is mainly possible against the imino tautomers. However, although Favipiravir and Ribavirin can make stable base pair interactions by using their keto and enol tautomers, the formation of the latter pairs would be less probable due to the endothermic nature of the products. Interestingly, the insertions of all of the RNA bases are found to be possible against the keto tautomer of Favipiravir, while the keto tautomer of Ribavirin has a clear preference for G. Remarkably, due to the negligible difference in the stability of EIDD-2801 and EIDD-1931, these tautomers would coexist in the biological environment. The insertion of G is found to be preferred against EIDD-1931 and the incorporations of U, A, and G are preferred opposite EIDD-2801. These findings suggest that base-pair mutations are the main causes of the antiviral properties of these drugs.

TI  - Interactions of Potential Anti-COVID-19 Compounds with Multispecific ABC and OATP Drug Transporters
T2  - PHARMACEUTICS
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, several repurposed drugs have been proposed to alleviate the major health effects of the disease. These drugs are often applied with analgesics or non-steroid anti-inflammatory compounds, and co-morbid patients may also be treated with anticancer, cholesterol-lowering, or antidiabetic agents. Since drug ADME-tox properties may be significantly affected by multispecific transporters, in this study, we examined the interactions of the repurposed drugs with the key human multidrug transporters present in the major tissue barriers and strongly affecting the pharmacokinetics. Our in vitro studies, using a variety of model systems, explored the interactions of the antimalarial agents chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; the antihelmintic ivermectin; and the proposed antiviral compounds ritonavir, lopinavir, favipiravir, and remdesivir with the ABCB1/Pgp, ABCG2/BCRP, and ABCC1/MRP1 exporters, as well as the organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)2B1 and OATP1A2 uptake transporters. The results presented here show numerous pharmacologically relevant transporter interactions and may provide a warning on the potential toxicities of these repurposed drugs, especially in drug combinations at the clinic.

TI  - Evolution of viral variants in remdesivir-treated and untreated SARS-CoV-2-infected pediatrics patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
AB  - Detailed information on intrahost viral evolution in SARS-CoV-2 with and without treatment is limited. Sequential viral loads and deep sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from the upper respiratory tract of nine hospitalized children, three of whom were treated with remdesivir, revealed that remdesivir treatment suppressed viral load in one patient but not in a second infected with an identical strain without any evidence of drug resistance found. Reduced levels of subgenomic RNA during treatment of the second patient, suggest an additional effect of remdesivir on viral replication. Haplotype reconstruction uncovered persistent SARS-CoV-2 variant genotypes in four patients. These likely arose from within-host evolution, although superinfection cannot be excluded in one case. Although our dataset is small, observed sample-to-sample heterogeneity in variant frequencies across four of nine patients suggests the presence of discrete viral populations in the lung with incomplete population sampling in diagnostic swabs. Such compartmentalization could compromise the penetration of remdesivir into the lung, limiting the drugs in vivo efficacy, as has been observed in other lung infections.

TI  - Successful recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia with awake early self-proning
T2  - AIN SHAMS JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Since COVID-19 global pandemic, "early awake proning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19" has been suggested as anecdotal evidence. Hereby, we report an awake and non-intubated patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who was successfully managed with early self-proning.
   Case presentation: A 68-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a respiratory distress. He was non-smoker and denied any significant past medical history. His chest computed tomography scan showed "ground glass opacities" and "consolidation areas" located especially in the peripheral sites of both lungs which were consistent with a coronavirus pneumonia and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification by a nasopharyngeal swab sample for SARS-Cov-2 was also positive. His initial therapy with hdroxychloroquine and favipiravir was started. Due to deterioration of the patient's oxygenation, he was transferred to the intensive care unit for further treatment with non-invasive mechanical ventilation on supine position and intermittent "awake early self-proning positioning" was applied. Additionally, antibiotherapy, anticoagulant therapy, and convalescent plasma therapy were also administered to the patient. On the 17th day of the ICU admission, he was transferred back to the ward. And the patient was discharged from the hospital on the 19th day of his initial admission.
   Conclusions: Although some case reports and small case series initially noted potential improvement in oxygenation by awake proning, further research is required to evaluate the exact benefits and proper applications of prone positioning in awake patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI  - A new short synthesis route for favipiravir and its analogue: Their tautomerization behaviour
T2  - NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB  - The study of tautomerism in biologically relevant heterocycles is essential, as it directly affects their chemical properties and biological function. Lactam-lactim tautomerization in pyridine/pyrazine derivatives is such a phenomenon. Favipiravir, a pyrazine derivative, is an essential antiviral drug molecule having notable performance against SARS-CoV-2. Along with a better yielding synthetic method for favipiravir, we have also investigated the lactam-lactim tautomerization of favipiravir and its analogous molecules. Most of these molecules were crystalized and studied for various interactions in their lattice. Many interesting supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking and halogen bonding were revealed during the analysis. Some of these structures show interesting F-F halogen bonding and water channels in their solid state.

TI  - The association between QT interval changes and the treatment protocols of COVID-19 patients
T2  - NORTHERN CLINICS OF ISTANBUL
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the QT, QTc, and QTc dispersion changes that may occur with the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), favipiravir, and moxifloxacin in combination or alone in COVID 19 patients.
   METHODS: This study was retrospectively conducted on 193 inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. We divided the patients into four separate groups due to their medications as, group-1: favipiravir, group-2: favipiravir + HCQ, group-3: favipiravir + moxifloxacin, and group-4: favipiravir + moxifloxacin + HCQ. We recorded their pre and post-treatment QT parameters of each group and evaluated the changes of these parameters with the SPSS statistical program.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 63.1 +/- 17.7. In group 1 and 2, although there were slight changes in QT parameters, these results were not statistically significant. In group 3, significant increases in QT and QTc dispersion occurred (p=0.005 and p=0.018). In the 4th group where the triple therapy was applied, there was a significant increase only in the QTc values (p=0.027). When we compared the changes of QT parameters for each group, a significant difference was found in Delta QTc dispersion, and post hoc analysis showed that it was due to changes in the third group (p=0.047).
   CONCLUSION: We thought that, if there is a COVID-19 infection with an additional bacterial infection, and if there is a need of using moxifloxacin alone or together with HCQ, additional risk factors that may cause QT interval prolongation should be reviewed and ECG monitoring of the patients should be performed during the treatment period.

TI  - The Therapeutic and Prophylactic Potential of Quercetin against COVID-19: An Outlook on the Clinical Studies, Inventive Compositions, and Patent Literature
T2  - ANTIOXIDANTS
AB  - Quercetin is a phenolic flavonol compound with established antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immuno-stimulant properties. Recent studies demonstrate the potential of quercetin against COVID-19. This article highlighted the prophylactic/therapeutic potential of quercetin against COVID-19 in view of its clinical studies, inventions, and patents. The literature for the subject matter was collected utilizing different databases, including PubMed, Sci-Finder, Espacenet, Patentscope, and USPTO. Clinical studies expose the potential of quercetin monotherapy, and also its combination therapy with other compounds, including zinc, vitamin C, curcumin, vitamin D3, masitinib, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin. The patent literature also examines claims that quercetin containing nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements, alone or in combination with other drugs/compounds, including favipiravir, remdesivir, molnupiravir, navitoclax, dasatinib, disulfiram, rucaparib, tamarixin, iota-carrageenan, and various herbal extracts (aloe, poria, rosemary, and sphagnum) has potential for use against COVID-19. The literature reveals that quercetin exhibits anti-COVID-19 activity because of its inhibitory effect on the expression of the human ACE2 receptors and the enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 (MPro, PLPro, and RdRp). The USFDA designated quercetin as a "Generally Recognized as Safe" substance for use in the food and beverage industries. It is also an inexpensive and readily available compound. These facts increase the possibility and foreseeability of making novel and economical drug combinations containing quercetin to prevent/treat COVID-19. Quercetin is an acidic compound and shows metabolic interaction with some antivirals, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory agents. Therefore, the physicochemical and metabolic drug interactions between quercetin and the combined drugs/compounds must be better understood before developing new compositions.

TI  - A review of the safety of favipiravir - a potential treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic?
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIRUS ERADICATION
AB  - Background: Repurposing broad-spectrum antivirals is an immediate treatment opportunity for 2019 coronavirus disease (COVI D-19). Favipiravir is an antiviral previously indicated for influenza and Ebola, which has shown some promise in early trials for treatment of COVI D-19. We aim to review existing favipiravir safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of favipiravir in COVI D-19.
   Methods: A search was conducted across EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by relevant grey-literature and ClinicalTrials.gov. All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27 March 2020 were considered for inclusion. Further analysis of available safety data from phase 2 and 3 studies was undertaken. Data extracted were adverse events (AEs) grade 1-4, serious AEs and discontinuation for AEs. Specific AEs of interest highlighted in early-phase studies, including gastrointestinal AEs and hyperuricaemia, were also examined.
   Results: Twenty-nine studies were identified as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir. Six were phase 2 and 3 studies reporting relevant safety data for statistical comparison, representing a total of 4299 participants, an estimated 175 person-years-of-follow-up (PYFU). Comparator drugs were oseltamivir, umifenovir, lopinavir/ritonavir or placebo. Study follow-up was between 5 and 21 days. The proportions of grade 1-4 AEs on favipiravir was 28.2% vs 28.4% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. The proportion of discontinuations due to AEs on favipiravir was 1.1% vs 1.2% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. For serious AEs the proportion was 0.4% in both arms (P = n.s.). There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8.7% vs 11.5%; P = 0.003]. Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8% vs 1.3%; P<0.0001].
   Conclusions: Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs. However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied. Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment. Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVI D-19.

TI  - Effectiveness of favipiravir in COVID-19: a live systematic review
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis for the effectiveness of Favipiravir on the fatality and the requirement of mechanical ventilation for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. We searched available literature and reported it by using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Until June 1, 2021, we searched PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Google Scholar by using the keywords "Favipiravir" and terms synonymous with COVID-19. Studies for Favipiravir treatment compared to standard of care among moderate and severe COVID-19 patients were included. Risk of bias assessment was performed using Revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and ROBINS-I assessment tool for non-randomized studies. We defined the outcome measures as fatality and requirement for mechanical ventilation. A total of 2702 studies were identified and 12 clinical trials with 1636 patients were analyzed. Nine out of 12 studies were randomized controlled trials. Among the randomized studies, one study has low risk of bias, six studies have moderate risk of bias, and 2 studies have high risk of bias. Observational studies were identified as having moderate risk of bias and non-randomized study was found to have serious risk of bias. Our meta-analysis did not reveal any significant difference between the intervention and the comparator on fatality rate (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.64-1.94) and mechanical ventilation requirement (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13-1.95). There is no significant difference in fatality rate and mechanical ventilation requirement between Favipiravir treatment and the standard of care in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Committee report: Questionnaire survey on the treatment of COVID-19 in patients receiving dialysis therapy
T2  - RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY
AB  - Background Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who receive dialysis therapy develop more severe disease and have a poorer prognosis than patients who do not. Although various data on the treatment of patients not receiving dialysis therapy have been reported, clinical practice for patients on dialysis is challenging as data is limited. The Infection Control Committee of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy decided to clarify the status of treatment in COVID-19 patients on dialysis. Methods A questionnaire survey of 105 centers that had treated at least five COVID-19 patients on dialysis was conducted in August 2021. Results Sixty-six centers (62.9%) responded to the questionnaire. Antivirals were administered in 27.7% of facilities treating mild disease (most patients received favipiravir) and 66.7% of facilities treating moderate disease (most patients with moderate or more severe conditions received remdesivir). Whether and how remdesivir is administered varies between centers. Steroids were initiated most frequently in moderate II disease (50.8%), while 43.1% of the facilities initiated steroids in mild or moderate I disease. The type of steroid, dose, and the duration of administration were generally consistent, with most facilities administering dexamethasone 6 mg orally or 6.6 mg intravenously for 10 days. Steroid pulse therapy was administered in 48.5% of the facilities, and tocilizumab was administered in 25.8% of the facilities, mainly to patients on ventilators or equivalent medications, or to the cases of exacerbations. Furthermore, some facilities used a polymethylmethacrylate membrane during dialysis, nafamostat as an anticoagulant, and continuous hemodiafiltration in severe cases. There was limited experience of polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column-direct hemoperfusion and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The discharge criteria for patients receiving dialysis therapy were longer than those set by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in 22.7% of the facilities. Conclusions Our survey revealed a variety of treatment practices in each facility. Further evidence and innovations are required to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 receiving dialysis therapy.

TI  - Effects of hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir on clinical course in outpatients with COVID-19
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background/aim: Due to the importance of early outpatient treatment to prevent hospitalization and disease progression, we examined the effects of hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir, which were initiated in early period, on the clinical course of COVID-19 outpatients. Materials and methods: Data of confirmed COVID-19 outpatients over a 4-month period were analyzed retrospectively. Public Health Management System (HSYS) was used for the case-based follow-up. Patients on antiviral therapy for at least five days, including hydroxychloroquine and / or favipiravir and patients who were followed-up for 30 days were included in this analysis. Results: We enrolled 1489 patients in this study. Overall, 775 (52%) patients were male and a mean age of patients was 38.9 +/- 11.1 years. Of these patients, 537 of them were received favipiravir, 545 of them were received hydroxychloroquine and 407 of them were received both favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. Symptoms improvement on the 14th day of follow-up was 1.8 times higher in the group of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine compared to patients who received favipiravir (p = 0.003). On the 3rd day of followup, PCR negativity rate was higher in patients who received hydroxychloroquine (p = 0.004). Hospitalization rates were similar in patients receiving favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine (p = 0.144). However, in the presence of pneumonia at the time of diagnosis, the hospitalization rate was 6.6 times higher in patients who received favipiravir than those who received hydroxychloroquine. Conclusion: The subgroups of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and/or favipiravir did not have similar disease severities in our study. Therefore, further studies with homogeneous patient groups to be arranged prospectively are needed.

TI  - Favipiravir-Based Ionic Liquids as Potent Antiviral Drugs for Oral Delivery: Synthesis, Solubility, and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation
T2  - MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread across the world, and no specific antiviral drugs have yet been approved to combat this disease. Favipiravir (FAV) is an antiviral drug that is currently in clinical trials for use against COVID-19. However, the delivery of FAV is challenging because of its limited solubility, and its formulation is difficult with common organic solvents and water. To address these issues, four FAV ionic liquids (FAV-ILs) were synthesized as potent antiviral prodrugs and were fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), derivative thermogravimetry (DTG), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The aqueous solubility and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of the FAV-ILs were also evaluated. The FAV-ILs exhibited improved aqueous solubility by 78 to 125 orders of magnitude when compared with that of free FAV. Upon oral dosing in mice, the absolute bioavailability of the beta-alanine ethyl ester FAV formulation was increased 1.9-fold compared with that of the control FAV formulation. The peak blood concentration, elimination half-life, and mean absorption time of FAV were also increased by 1.5-, 2.0-, and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with the control. Furthermore, the FAV in the FAV-ILs exhibited significantly different biodistribution compared with the control FAV formulation. Interestingly, drug accumulation in the lungs and liver was improved 1.5-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively, compared with the control FAV formulation. These results indicate that the use of ILs exhibits potential as a simple, scalable strategy to improve the solubility and oral absorption of hydrophobic drugs, such as FAV.

TI  - In silico Exploration of Interactions Between Potential COVID-19 Antiviral Treatments and the Pore of the hERG Potassium Channel-A Drug Antitarget
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - Background: In the absence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral treatments, various repurposed pharmaceutical approaches are under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19. Antiviral drugs considered for this condition include atazanavir, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, and favipiravir. Whilst the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir has been previously linked to prolongation of the QT(c) interval on the ECG and risk of torsades de pointes arrhythmia, less is known in this regard about atazanavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir. Unwanted abnormalities of drug-induced QT(c) prolongation by diverse drugs are commonly mediated by a single cardiac anti-target, the hERG potassium channel. This computational modeling study was undertaken in order to explore the ability of these five drugs to interact with known determinants of drug binding to the hERG channel pore.
   Methods: Atazanavir, remdesivir, ritonavir, lopinavir and favipiravir were docked to in silico models of the pore domain of hERG, derived from cryo-EM structures of hERG and the closely related EAG channel.
   Results: Atazanavir was readily accommodated in the open hERG channel pore in proximity to the S6 Y652 and F656 residues, consistent with published experimental data implicating these aromatic residues in atazanavir binding to the channel. Lopinavir, ritonavir, and remdesivir were also accommodated in the open channel, making contacts in a model-dependent fashion with S6 aromatic residues and with residues at the base of the selectivity filter/pore helix. The ability of remdesivir (at 30 mu M) to inhibit the channel was confirmed using patch-clamp recording. None of these four drugs could be accommodated in the closed channel structure. Favipiravir, a much smaller molecule, was able to fit within the closed channel and could adopt multiple binding poses in the open channel, but with few simultaneous interactions with key binding residues. Only favipiravir and remdesivir showed the potential to interact with lateral pockets below the selectivity filter of the channel.
   Conclusions: All the antiviral drugs studied here can, in principle, interact with components of the hERG potassium channel canonical binding site, but are likely to differ in their ability to access lateral binding pockets. Favipiravir's small size and relatively paucity of simultaneous interactions may confer reduced hERG liability compared to the other drugs. Experimental structure-function studies are now warranted to validate these observations.

TI  - Pharmacogenomics of COVID-19 therapies
T2  - NPJ GENOMIC MEDICINE
AB  - A new global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in high mortality and morbidity. Currently numerous drugs are under expedited investigations without well-established safety or efficacy data. Pharmacogenomics may allow individualization of these drugs thereby improving efficacy and safety. In this review, we summarized the pharmacogenomic literature available for COVID-19 drug therapies including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, interferon beta-1b, tocilizumab, ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and corticosteroids. We searched PubMed, reviewed the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB(R)) website, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pharmacogenomics information in the product labeling, and the FDA pharmacogenomics association table. We found several drug-gene variant pairs that may alter the pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, SLCO1A2, and SLCO1B1); azithromycin (ABCB1); ribavirin (SLC29A1, SLC28A2, and SLC28A3); and lopinavir/ritonavir (SLCO1B1, ABCC2, CYP3A). We also identified other variants, that are associated with adverse effects, most notable in hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (G6PD; hemolysis), ribavirin (ITPA; hemolysis), and interferon beta -1b (IRF6; liver toxicity). We also describe the complexity of the risk for QT prolongation in this setting because of additive effects of combining more than one QT-prolonging drug (i.e., hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and azithromycin), increased concentrations of the drugs due to genetic variants, along with the risk of also combining therapy with potent inhibitors. In conclusion, although direct evidence in COVID-19 patients is lacking, we identified potential actionable genetic markers in COVID-19 therapies. Clinical studies in COVID-19 patients are deemed warranted to assess potential roles of these markers.

TI  - Current Understanding of COVID-19 Clinical Course and Investigational Treatments
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Importance: Currently, there is no unified framework linking disease progression to established viral levels, clinical tests, inflammatory markers, and investigational treatment options.
   Objective: It may take many weeks or months to establish a standard treatment approach. Given the growing morbidity and mortality with respect to COVID-19, this systemic review presents a treatment approach based on a thorough review of scholarly articles and clinical reports. Our focus is on staged progression, clinical algorithms, and individualized treatment.
   Evidence Review: We followed the protocol for a quality review article proposed by Heyn et al. (1). A literature search was conducted to find all relevant studies related to COVID-19. The search was conducted between April 1, 2020, and April 13, 2020, using the following electronic databases: PubMed (1809 to present); Google Scholar (1900 to present); MEDLINE (1946 to present), CINAHL (1937 to present); and Embase (1980 to present). The keywords used included COVID-19, 2019-nCov, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, with terms such as efficacy, seroconversion, microbiology, pathophysiology, viral levels, inflammation, survivability, and treatment and pharmacology. No language restriction was placed on the search. Reference lists were manually scanned for additional studies.
   Findings: Of the articles found in the literature search, 70 were selected for inclusion in this study (67 cited in the body of the manuscript and 3 additional unique references in the Figures). The articles represent work from China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Rwanda, Israel, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States. Most of the articles were cohort or case studies, but we also drew upon other information, including guidelines from hospitals and clinics instructing their staff on procedures to follow. In addition, we based some decisions on data collected by organizations such as the CDC, FDA, IHME, IDSA, and Worldometer. None of the case studies or cohort studies used a large number of participants. The largest group of participants numbered <500 and some case studies had fewer than 30 patients. However, the review of the literature revealed the need for individualized treatment protocols due to the variability of patient clinical presentation and survivability. A number of factors appear to influence mortality: the stage at which the patient first presented for care, pre-existing health conditions, age, and the viral load the patient carried.
   Conclusion and Relevance: COVID-19 can be divided into three distinct stages, beginning at the time of infection (Stage I), sometimes progressing to pulmonary involvement (Stage II, with or without hypoxemia), and less frequently to systemic inflammation (Stage III). In addition to modeling the stages of disease progression along with diagnostic testing, we have also created a treatment algorithm that considers age, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and disease progression to suggest drug classes or treatment modalities. This paper presents the first evidence-based recommendations for individualized treatment for COVID-19.

TI  - Phase 2a, open-label, dose-escalating, multi-center pharmacokinetic study of favipiravir (T-705) in combination with oseltamivir in patients with severe influenza
T2  - EBIOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: The pharmacokinetics and appropriate dose regimens of favipiravir are unknown in hospitalized influenza patients; such data are also needed to determine dosage selection for favipiravir trials in COVID-19.
   Methods: In this dose-escalating study, favipiravir pharmacokinetics and tolerability were assessed in critically ill influenza patients. Participants received one of two dosing regimens; Japan licensed dose (1600 mg BID on day 1 and 600 mg BID on the following days) and the higher dose (1800 mg/800 mg BID) trialed in uncomplicated influenza. The primary pharmacokinetic endpoint was the proportion of patients with a minimum observed plasma trough concentration (C-trough) >= 20 mg/L at all measured time points after the second dose.
   Results: Sixteen patients were enrolled into the low dose group and 19 patients into the high dose group of the study. Favipiravir C-trough decreased significantly over time in both groups (p <0.01). Relative to day 2 (48 hrs), concentrations were 91.7% and 90.3% lower in the 1600/600 mg group and 79.3% and 89.5% lower in the 1800/800 mg group at day 7 and 10, respectively. In contrast, oseltamivir concentrations did not change significantly over time. A 2-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and elimination described the observed favipiravir concentration-time data well. Modeling demonstrated that less than 50% of patients achieved C-trough >= 20 mg/L for >80% of the duration of treatment of the two dose regimens evaluated (18.8% and 42.1% of patients for low and high dose regimen, respectively). Increasing the favipravir dosage predicted a higher proportion of patients reaching this threshold of 20 mg/L, suggesting that dosing regimens of >= 3600/2600 mg might be required for adequate concentrations. The two dosing regimens were well-tolerated in critical ill patients with influenza.
   Conclusion: The two dosing regimens proposed for uncomplicated influenza did not achieve our pre-defined treatment threshold. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A possible interaction between favipiravir and methotrexate: Drug-induced hepatotoxicity in a patient with osteosarcoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY PHARMACY PRACTICE
AB  - Introduction Favipiravir is an antiviral agent that is recently used for SARS-CoV2 infection. The drug-drug interactions of favipiravir especially with chemotherapeutic agents in a patient with malignancy are not well known. Case report The patient diagnosed with metastatic osteosarcoma was given high dose methotrexate treatment, and favipiravir was started on the third day of the treatment with suspicion of SARS-CoV2 infection. Grade 3 hepatotoxicity developed after favipiravir. Management & outcome: The acute viral hepatitis panel and autoimmune liver disease panel were negative. The ultrasound of the abdomen was unremarkable for any hepatobiliary pathology. The all viral and hepatobiliary possible etiological factors were ruled out. The patient's liver enzymes increased just after (12 hours later) the initiation of favipiravir, and we diagnosed toxic hepatitis caused by favipiravir-methotrexate interaction. Therefore, methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg dose was started for a presumed diagnosis of toxic hepatitis. Hepatotoxicity completely regressed after favipiravir was discontinued. Discussion Favipiravir may inhibit methotrexate elimination by inhibiting aldehyde oxidase and its sequential use may cause hepatotoxicity in this case. The clinicians should keep in mind possible drug interactions while using new antiviral agents against SARS-CoV2 like favipiravir.

TI  - Favipiravir (SARS-CoV-2) degradation impurities: Identification and route of degradation mechanism in the finished solid dosage form using LC/LC-MS method
T2  - BIOMEDICAL CHROMATOGRAPHY
AB  - Favipiravir finished dosage was approved for emergency use in many countries to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients. A specific, accurate, linear, robust, simple, and stability-indicating HPLC method was developed and validated for the determination of degradation impurities present in favipiravir film-coated tablets. The separation of all impurities was achieved from the stationary phase (Inert sustain AQ-C18, 250 x 4.6 mm, 5-mu m particle) and mobile phase. Mobile phase A contained KH2PO4 buffer (pH 2.5 +/- 0.05) and acetonitrile in the ratio of 98:2 (v/v), and mobile phase B contained water and acetonitrile in the ratio of 50:50 (v/v). The chromatographic conditions were optimized as follows: flow rate, 0.7 mL/min; UV detection, 210 nm; injection volume, 20 mu L; and column temperature, 33 degrees C. The proposed method was validated per the current International Conference on Harmonization Q2 (R1) guidelines. The recovery study and linearity ranges were established from the limit of quantification to 150% optimal concentrations. The method validation results were found to be between 98.6 and 106.2% for recovery and r(2) = 0.9995-0.9999 for linearity of all identified impurities. The method precision results were achieved below 5% of relative standard deviation. Forced degradation studies were performed in chemical and physical stress conditions. The compound was sensitive to chemical stress conditions. During the study, the analyte degraded and converted to unknown degradation impurities, and its molecular mass was found using the LC-MS technique and established degradation pathways supported by reaction of mechanism. The developed method was found to be suitable for routine analysis of research and development and quality control.

TI  - Angioedema after favipiravir treatment: Two cases
T2  - JOURNAL OF COSMETIC DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Drug-induced angioedema often affects elderly patients with chronic drug use. Proper diagnosis and prompt with effective treatment reduce mortality. With the increasing use of favipiravir, many side effects, especially increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels due to liver toxicity, and also skin lesions are reported. First patient oral favipiravir treatment on the second day was admitted to the hospital with rash and swelling on the eyelids. Second patient suffered from significant swelling on the upper lip and displayed angioedema. In this cases, angioedema findings regressed after rapid diagnosis and parenterally administered antihistamine and steroid treatment. Although there is no effective drug therapy in the treatment of COVID-19, favipiravir is also included in the treatment protocols in many countries. Clinicians should be careful about the side effects and possible skin manifestations, especially including angioedema, related to the use of favipiravir.

TI  - COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: A promising treatment algorithm in the absence of a disease-specific drug
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
AB  - There is no consensus on the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and modification of immunosuppressive therapy in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). In this study, we examined the clinical outcome of our KTRs with COVID-19 disease, who were treated with a broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory protocol. This protocol is essentially composed of intravenous immunoglobulin +/- tocilizumab in KTRs with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Among 809 KTRs, 64 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 disease between April 2020 and February 2021, were evaluated. Twenty-nine patients with pneumonia confirmed by chest computed tomography (CCT) were hospitalized. The treatment protocol included high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, favipiravir, enoxaparin, and empirical antibiotics. Patients with pneumonic involvement of more than 25% on CCT with or without respiratory failure were given a total of 2 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. Nonresponders received tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antibody. Of the 29 patients with pneumonia, 6 were treated in other hospitals. These six patients did not receive IVIg and 5 of them deceased. In our center, IVIg treatment was applied to 15 of 23 patients. Seven of them required tocilizumab. Respiratory parameters improved significantly in all but one patient after IVIg +/- tocilizumab treatment. The mortality rate was 6.6% in patients who received IVIg therapy and 35.7% in those who did not (p = 0.08). The mortality rate was higher in patients who received treatment in external centers (2.2% vs. 26.3%; p = 0.0073). The treatment of KTRs with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in organ transplant centers with significant experience yields better results. The administration of broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory treatment in this patient group was safe and provided excellent outcomes.

TI  - Case report of restless anal syndrome as restless legs syndrome variant after COVID-19
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a broad spectrum from respiratory and nasopharyngeal symptoms, cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, and skeletal muscle injury. Emerging evidence has indicated the neural spread of this novel coronavirus. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological, sensorimotor disorder, but highly under diagnosis disorder. Restless anal syndrome as restless legs syndrome variant associated with COVID-19 has been previously not published. We report a case presenting with restless anal syndrome following COVID-19. Case presentation Although a 77-year-old male with COVID-19 improved to normal respiratory function 21 days after admission and treatment of favipiravir 200 mg per day for 14 days and dexamethasone 6.6 mg per day for 5 days, the insomnia and anxiety symptoms remained. Several weeks after discharge, he gradually began to experience restless, deep anal discomfort, approximately 10 cm from the perineal region. The following features were observed in the anal region; urge to move is essential, with worsening with rest, improvement with exercise, and worsening at evening. Colonoscopy revealed internal haemorrhoids without other rectal lesions. Neurological findings including deep tendon reflex, perineum loss of sensory and spinal cord injury, revealed no abnormalities. Diabetes militias, kidney dysfunction and iron deficiency status were not confirmed. Family history of RLS and periodic limb movements were not observed. Clonazepam at 1.5 mg per day resulted in the alleviation restless anal discomfort. Conclusions We reported a case presenting with restless anal syndrome following affection of COVID-19 as restless legs syndrome variant. This case fulfilled 4 essential features of RLS, urge to move, worsening with rest, improvement with exercise, and worsening at evening. To date, no case of restless anal syndrome associated with COVID-19 has been previously published. This case report may reflect the associative impacts of COVID-19 on the neuropsychiatric state. The long-term outcomes of neuropsychiatric conditions should continue to be monitored.

TI  - Favipiravir: insight into the crystal structure, Hirshfeld surface analysis and computational study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE IRANIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB  - In this work we report structural and computational studies of favipiravir, which is now used as a drug for COVID-19 treatment. The molecule is completely flat and stabilized by an intramolecular O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bond, yielding a six-membered pseudo-aromatic ring. The aromaticity index of this pseudo-aromatic ring was found to be 0.748, while the same indix for the pyrazine ring in favipiravir was found to be 0.954. The crystal packing of favipiravir is mainly constructed through intermolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot O, N-H center dot center dot center dot N and C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds, yielding a 3D supramolecular framework with a zst topology defined by the point symbol of (6(5)center dot 8). The crystal structure of favipiravir is further stabilized by weak C-F center dot center dot center dot F-C intermolecular type II dihalogen interactions, yielding a 1D supramolecular polymeric chain. More than 80% of the total Hirshfeld surface area for favipiravir is occupied by H center dot center dot center dot H/C/N/O/F and C center dot center dot center dot N/O contacts. Energy frameworks have been calculated to additionally analyze the overall crystal packing. It was established that the structure of favipiravir is mainly characterized by the dispersion energy framework followed by the less significant electrostatic energy framework contribution. Finally, by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, we have assigned the interaction energy of each hydrogen bond, which can be helpful to develop scoring functions to be used in force fields/docking calculations.

TI  - Effectiveness of Borage plus syrup on COVID-19 patients in intensive care units
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION
AB  - IntroductionCOVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) still causes a high rate of death globally with no definite curative treatment described. The traditional plant Borage (Borago officinalis L.) is a good source of gamma-linolenic (GLA). We hypothesized that Borage plus syrup (BPS) would be beneficial in severe COVID-19 patients within an intensive care unit (ICU) setting.Materials and methodsA pilot single center, randomized trial with no placebo was undertaken. A total of 60 PCR-positive severe COVID-19 participants admitted to ICU from June 2020-December 2020 at Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran-Iran gave informed consent. The participants were randomly assigned to either Borage Plus Syrup (BPS, 5 ml for 5 days) (n = 30) or standard care (IFN-beta and favipiravir) as a control group (n = 30). Pao2/Fio2, serum ferritin, CRP, bilirubin, IL-6, TNF-alpha, ALT, AST, PCT and serum IL-8 was measured upon admission and on release.ResultsAll the measured parameters decreased significantly with BPS treatment. In the control group, most parameters significantly improved apart from AST and PCT. In addition, the suppression of serum TNF levels in the BPS group was greater than that seen in the control group (P & LE; 0.05). Moreover, the length of ICU stay was significantly lower in the BPS group compared with the control group (P & LE; 0.05).ConclusionOur study shows that addition of BPS to the standard treatment regime of COVID-19 patients in ICU improved outcomes and reduced the length of ICU treatment. Natural products could be considered as new approaches for reducting the harmful consequences of COVID-19.

TI  - STUDY OF CLINICAL AND PATHOGENETIC EFFECTS OF ANTI-VIRAL DRUG BASED ON FAVIPIRAVIR IN COMORBID PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 AT THE OUTPATIENT STAGE OF TREATMENT
T2  - PHARMACY & PHARMACOLOGY-FARMATSIYA I FARMAKOLOGIYA
AB  - In many ways, arterial hypertension and obesity determine the likelihood of a severe course and lethal outcomes in COVID-19. This fact justifies the expediency of an early use of drugs with a direct antiviral action, the analysis of their efficacy not only in the acute, but also in the postcovid period.
   The aim of the research was to analyze the outpatient cards and case histories of the COVID-19 patients to study the effect of the early (up to the 5th day after the onset of the first symptoms of the disease) use of the drug based on favipiravir, on the frequency of patients' hospitalizations with arterial hypertension and obesity, as well as to determine the cytokine status characteristics of this patient category in the postcovid period.
   Materials and methods. "An open prospective comparative study of the "Areplivie" (favipiravir) efficacy in the debut of COVID-19 in comorbid patients" was carried out in the Republic of Mordovia (the analysis of the hospitalizations frequency and blood levels of M-CSF, EPO in 218 patients, in terms of the use of the antiviral preparation).
   Results. According to the results of the analysis, it was found out that, despite the presence of comorbid conditions that increase the risk of developing a severe course of COVID-19, i.e. obesity and essential arterial hypertension, in the group of patients taking favipiravir, the need for hospitalization was twice as low (p < 0.05), in relation to the comparison group. The analysis of the cytokine status revealed that in the postcovid period, in the group that took the drug based on favipiravir at the outpatient stage, the average level of M-CSF was significantly lower (p> 0.05), and EPO was higher (p> 0.05) than in the patients from the group "without antiviral drugs at the outpatient stage". Indirectly, according to the previously obtained data, that acts as a potential marker for reducing the risk of long-term cardiovascular complications of COVID-19.
   Conclusion. This study showed that an early prescription of favipiravir contributes to a decrease in the rate of COVID-19 patients' hospitalization even against the background of concomitant hypertension and obesity, due to a decrease in the likelihood of moderate and severe courses of the disease, and also leads to an earlier objective and subjective recovery. The results demonstrated a high potential benefit of an early favipiravir use in the novel coronavirus infection and in the prevention of postcovid complications.

TI  - Design, Spectroscopic, and Crystal Structural Characterization of New Pyrazolone-Based Schiff Bases: Molecular Docking Investigations against SARS-Covid-19 Main Proteases (PDB Ids: 6LU7 and 7TLL)
T2  - POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC COMPOUNDS
AB  - New pyrazolone-based Schiff bases were synthesized and characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical techniques such as H-1-NMR, FTIR, and UV - Vis spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Crystal structures of two of the Schiff-base (SB) compounds were obtained by single-crystal X-ray crystallography (SCXRC). The target Schiff bases were synthesized from the condensation of 4-acetyl-3-methyl-1-phenyl-5-pyrazolone with 1,2-diaminobenzene (SB1), 4-methyl-1,2-diaminobenzene (SB2), and 4,5-dimethy-1,2-diaminobenzene (SB3). Molecular docking modeling was used to study the interactions of these molecules with SARS-CoV-2 virus main proteases (PDB ids: 6LU7 and 7TLL). The estimated free binding energies (EFBE) for all the three SBs were better than the standard drugs favipiravir and dexamethasone. Besides, the order of EFBE was -7.68 (SB3)> -7.36 (SB1)> -7.06 kcal.mol(-1) (SB2) for 6LU7 and -10.42 (SB3)> -10.05 (SB1)> -9.69 kcal.mol(-1) (SB2) for 7TLL. SB3 showed the best interactions with both proteases that is discussed based on structure-function relationship.

TI  - Efficacy of pharmacological interventions in COVID-19: A network meta-analysis
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Aims To perform network meta-analysis for a head-to-head comparison of various interventions used in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on mortality, clinical recovery, time to clinical improvement and the occurrence of serious adverse events. Methods Systematic search was performed using online databases with suitable MeSH terms including coronavirus, COVID-19, randomized controlled trial, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, remdesivir, favipiravir, dexamethasone and interferon-beta. Data were independently extracted by 2 study investigators and analysed. Results Out of 1225 studies screened, 23 were included for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Among the drugs studied, dexamethasone reduces mortality by 10%, with a relative risk of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [0.82-0.97]) and increases clinical recovery by 6% (relative risk 1.06, 95% confidence interval [1.02-1.10]) compared to standard of care. Similarly, remdesivir administered for 10 days increased clinical recovery by 10%, reduced time to clinical improvement by 4 days and lowered the occurrence of serious adverse events by 27% as compared to standard of care. Conclusion In comparison to standard of care, dexamethasone was found to increase clinical recovery and lower mortality; remdesivir was significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality as compared to tocilizumab and higher clinical recovery and shorter time to clinical improvement as compared to hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab; remdesivir followed by tocilizumab were found to have lesser occurrence of serious adverse events in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.

TI  - Isolation of phytochemicals from Malva neglecta Wallr and their quantum chemical, molecular docking exploration as active drugs against COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF SAUDI CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemics caused by SARS-CoV-19, and the inadequacy of targeted medications, compelled scientists to seek new antiviral drugs. We present our current understanding of plant extracts containing polyphenols that inhibit Covid-19. Natural phytochemicals (polyphenols) derived from plants have the potential to establish research using extracts and/or individual compounds in the treatment and prevention of coronavirus. The polyphenolic drugs (antivirus) capable of inhibiting the coronavirus protein, that are vital for infection and virus replication. The benefit of phytochemicals is that they promote patient well-being while causing minimal side effects. To understand the antiviral behavior of isolated phytochemicals 1-6, various molecular descriptors, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), and frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) were investigated. A systematic analysis of isolated phytochemicals was accomplished then molecular descriptors, docking score, active sites, and FMOs energies were compared to the commonly used drugs recently to treat COVID19, namely favipiravir, remdesivir dexamethasone and hydroxychloroquine. Using a molecular docking technique, we demonstrate for the first time that these plant phytochemicals can be inhibited by the core protease (6LU7) protein of COVID19.

TI  - A critical review on environmental presence of pharmaceutical drugs tested for the covid-19 treatment
T2  - PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AB  - On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The outbreak caused a worldwide impact, becoming a health threat to the general population and its professionals. To date, there are no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines for the COVID-19 infection, however, some drugs are being clinically tested. The use of these drugs on large scale raises great concern about their imminent environmental risk, since the elimination of these compounds by feces and urine associated with the inefficiency of sewage treatment plants in their removal can result in their persistence in the environment, putting in risk the health of humans and of other species. Thus, the goal of this work was to conduct a review of other studies that evaluated the presence of the drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin, dexamethasone, remdesivir, favipiravir and some HIV antivirals in the environment. The research indicated the presence of these drugs in the environment in different regions, with concentration data that could serve as a basis for further comparative studies following the pandemic.

TI  - Green micellar solvent-free HPLC and spectrofluorimetric determination of favipiravir as one of COVID-19 antiviral regimens
T2  - MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Quality control (QC) of pharmaceutical products requires fast, sensitive as well as economic methodologies in order to provide high through output at low cost which are the main aspects considered by such economic facilities. Meanwhile, the ecological impacts must be considered by researchers to minimize the hazardous effects of research laboratories. Favipiravir (FAV) is an antiviral agent recently approved for treatment of COVID-19 infections during 2020 pandemic crisis, so the size of its production by international pharmaceutical corporations evolved dramatically within the past few months. Two novel simple, sensitive, and green methods were developed and validated for FAV determination based on solvent-free micellar LC and spectrofluorimetry techniques. To improve FAV native fluorescence, several factors were studied including solvent type, buffering, pH and added surfactants. The best sensitivity for FAV fluorescence was obtained in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 4) at 436 nm after excitation at 323 nm within concentration range of 20?350 ng mL-1. Another HPLC method was validated using C18-RP (5 ?m, 250 ? 4.6 mm) stationary phase and solvent-free mobile phase consisting of (0.02 M Brij-35, 0.15 M SDS, and 0.02 M disodium hydrogen phosphate, pH 5.0) isocratically eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL min- 1 and detection wavelength of 323 nm. LC method was validated across concentration range of 10?100 ?g mL-1 and FAV eluted in 3.8 min. The methods were validated according to the FDA guidelines and were applied successfully for determination of FAV in its marketed tablet dosage forms and in spiked human plasma samples. The proposed methods are eco-friendly since they are typically based on biodegradable reagents in aqueous solvent-free phases, which was proven by their assessment on two recent greenness metrics (GAPI and AGREE) to prove their eco-friendly properties.

TI  - The predictors of COVID-19 mortality in a nationwide cohort of Turkish patients
T2  - RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
AB  - The COVID-19-related death rate varies between countries and is affected by various risk factors. This multi-center registry study was designed to evaluate the mortality rate and the related risk factors in Turkey. We retrospectively evaluated 1500 adults with COVID-19 from 26 centers who were hospitalized between March 11 and July 31, 2020. In the study group, 1041 and 459 cases were diagnosed as definite and highly probable cases, respectively. There were 993 PCR-positive cases (66.2%). Among all cases, 1144 (76.3%) were diagnosed with non-severe pneumonia, whereas 212 (14.1%) had severe pneumonia. Death occurred in 67 patients, corresponding to a mortality rate of 4.5% (95% CI:3.5-5.6). The univariate analysis demonstrated that various factors, including male sex, age >= 65 years and the presence of dyspnea or confusion, malignity, chronic obstructive lung disease, interstitial lung disease, immunosuppressive conditions, severe pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, and sepsis, were positively associated with mortality. Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were not associated with survival. Following multivariate analysis, male sex, severe pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, malignancy, sepsis and interstitial lung diseases were found to be independent risk factors for mortality. Among the biomarkers, procalcitonin levels on the 3rd-5th days of admission showed the strongest associations with mortality (OR: 6.18; 1.6-23.93). This study demonstrated that the mortality rate in hospitalized patients in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was a serious threat and that those patients with male sex, severe pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, malignancy, sepsis and interstitial lung diseases were at increased risk of mortality; therefore, such patients should be closely monitored.

TI  - Favipiravir attachment to a conical nanocarbon: DFT assessments of the drug delivery approach
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Density functional theory (DFT) quantum calculations were performed to investigate attachment of favipiravir (FAV) to a conical nanocarbon (FCN) for assessments of the drug delivery approach. The continuous negative impacts of COVID-19 made an urgent of performing further investigations on developing its medication processes, in which FAV has been one of proposed drugs of medication of COVID-19. To this aim, the attachment of FAV to FCN was investigated in this work for showing benefits of such FAV@FCN complex formations. The apex of conical nanocarbon was doped by an iron atom to make an active site of interactions, in which three configurations of FAV versus FCN were obtained with different levels of strength and electronic features. In this regard, details of interactions were examined by the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM). As a consequence, the investigated models of FAV@FCN could be proposed for drug delivery purposes.

TI  - Clinical findings in patients with leprosy who are infected with COVID-19: a case series from Elazig, Turkey
T2  - LEPROSY REVIEW
AB  - Background: Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae that can be self-limiting or progressive according to the immunological status of the host organism.
   Aim and objectives: We present the demographic and clinical characteristics of lepromatous leprosy (LL) patients who had Covid-19 infection.
   Materials and methods: This study recruited patients hospitalized in Elazig Leprosy Hospital. Details of the patients were collected as follows: age, gender, presence of comorbidity, leprosy classification, clinical presentation, presence of leprosy reactions and complaints at the time of admission; laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings and treatments applied.
   Results: This study included 9 patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL classification). Six patients were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, 7 patients had thoracic CT involvement. The mean age was 78.7 years (range 65-95). Complaints on admission included fatigue (n:7), cough (n:4) and fever (n:3) followed by sore throat (n:1), headache (n:1) and dysphonia (n:1). Two patients were asymptomatic, PCR positivity was detected in one and CT positivity was detected in another during screening. All patients received treatment with favipiravir and enoxaparin. No leprosy reactions occurred. All patients were discharged with recovery after completion of treatment.
   Conclusion: We expected that the risk for catching COVID-19 may be higher in LL patients who have a cellular immunity deficiency, and that the course of the infection may be more severe in COVID-19-infected LL patients, for the same reason. However, we have seen a decrease in the clinical severity of the COVID-19 and no patient losses. We conclude that this situation may be due to the drugs used for leprosy treatment.These immune-modulating drugs may cause a decrease in the clinical severity of the COVID-19, but we need larger studies on this subject.

AB  - In December 2019, when the whole world is waiting for Christmas and New Year, the physicians of Wuhan, China, are astounded by clusters of patients suffering from pneumonia from unknown causes. The pathogen isolated from the respiratory epithelium of the patients is similar to previously known coronaviruses with some distinct features. The disease was initially called nCoV-2019 or SARS-nCoV-2 and later termed as COVID-19 by WHO. The infection is rapidly propagating from the day of emergence, spread throughout the globe and now became a pandemic which challenged the competencies of developed nations in terms of health care management. As per WHO report, 216 countries are affected with SARS-CoV-19 by August 5, 2020 with 18, 142, 718 confirmed cases and 691,013 deaths reports. Such huge mortality and morbidity rates are truly threatening and calls for some aggressive and effective measures to slow down the disease transmission. The scientists are constantly engaged in finding a potential solution to diagnose and treat the pandemic. Various FDA approved drugs with the previous history of antiviral potency are repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. Different drugs and vaccines are under clinical trials and some rapid and effective diagnostic tools are also under development. In this review, we have highlighted the current epidemiology through infographics, disease transmission and progression, clinical features and diagnosis and possible therapeutic approaches for COVID-19. The article mainly focused on the development and possible application of various FDA approved drugs, including chloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, nefamostate mesylate, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, ribavirin etc., vaccines under development and various registered clinical trials exploring different therapeutic measures for the treatment of COVID-19. This information will definitely help the researchers to understand the in-line scientific progress by various clinical agencies and regulatory bodies against COVID-19.

TI  - The efficacy and adverse effects of favipiravir on patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published clinical trials and observational studies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of favipiravir in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Our protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020206305). Fourteen databases were searched until February 8th, 2021. An update search for new RCTs was done on March 2nd, 2022. Meta analysis was done for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. Results: Overall, 157 studies (24 RCTs, 1 non-RCT, 21 observational studies, 2 case series, and 106 case reports) were included. On hospitalized patients, in comparison to standard of care, favipiravir showed a higher rate of viral clearance at day 5 (RR = 1.60, p = 0.02), defervescence at day 3-4 (RR = 1.99, p < 0.01), chest radiological improvement (RR = 1.33, p < 0.01), hospital discharge at day 10-11 (RR = 1.19, p < 0.01), and shorter clinical improvement time (MD = -1.18, p = 0.05). Regarding adverse events, favipiravir groups had higher rates of hyperuricemia (RR = 9.42, p < 0.01), increased alanine aminotransferase (RR = 1.35, p < 0.01) but lower rates of nausea (RR = 0.42, p < 0.01) and vomiting (R R = 0.19, p = 0.02). There were no differences regarding mortality (RR = 1.19, p = 0.32), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (RR = 1.11, p = 0.25). On nonhospitalized patients, no significant differences were reported. Conclusions: Adding favipiravir to the standard of care provides better outcomes for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Pregnant, lactating women, and patients with a history of hyperuricemia should avoid using favipiravir.(C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

T2  - INORGANIC AND NANO-METAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Oxovanadium(IV) complexes of dibasic symmetrical bis-Schiff bases synthesized from 1,6-hexanediamine and orthohydroxy aldehydes or diketones. Their formation was confirmed with the help of elemental analysis, FTIR, H-1 NMR, UV-visible and mass spectra, magnetic susceptibility, and conductance measurements. Quantum mechanical calculations are indicative to the proposed structures of the complexes. Most of the ligands and complexes have considerable inhibition capacity on mycelia growth against selected pathogenic fungi and bacteria and show good antioxidant property too. Complexes showed good larvicidal activity against the mosquito larvae (Culex quinquefasciatus). Molecular docking of a Schiff base, (BzA-HD-BzAH(2)) with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro revealed the best binding affinity with the receptor protein compared to the approved medicine hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and favipiravir (FVP). The ADMET analysis showed that ligand is non-carcinogenic and less toxic than standards, HCQ or FVP. However, these in silico studies proved BzA-HD-BzAH(2) to be a good candidate for development as a therapeutic drug against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Electrochemical degradation of favipiravir (anti-viral) drug from aqueous solution: optimization of operating parameters using the response surface method
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The aim of the current study is to investigate the efficacy of the electro-Fenton process in the degradation of favipiravir drugs from aqueous solutions, which has increased in use as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was developed using a Central Composite Design (CCD) in which five independent variables, including Fe2+ concentration, current density, initial FVP concentration, pH, and reaction time, were coded with high and low levels, and the maximum removal percentage of FVP (97.8%) and COD (91.65%) were determined as responses. In the EF process, 530 mg/L H2O2 was produced in-situ by cathodic reduction of O-2 in aqueous solution and thus FVP has been successfully oxidized through hydroxyl radicals. The H2O2/Fe2+ ratio was determined to be 0.51 under optimum conditions. At the end of the experiment, the maximum energy consumption was found to be 2.12 kWh per g COD. The FVP was completely mineralized in a very short time by the EF process, according to the LC-MS/MS examination. The EF process followed the pseudo first-order kinetic model with the rate constants of 0.023, 0.016 and 0.006 1/min for pH 2, 3 and 4, respectively. According to the findings of this study, the electro-Fenton process is an effective method for removing FVP from aqueous solutions. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to show the degradation and optimum conditions of FVP in aqueous solution using the electro-Fenton (EF) process.

TI  - Risk factors associated with mortality in intensive care COVID-19 patients: the importance of chest CT score and intubation timing as risk factors
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background/aim: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease with a high rate of progression to critical illness. However, the predictors of mortality in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are not yet well understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with ICU mortality in our hospital.
   Materials and methods: In this single-centered retrospective study, we enrolled 86 critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU of Dokuz Eylul University
   Hospital (Izmir, Turkey) between 18 March 2020 and 31 October 2020. Data on demographic information, preexisting comorbidities, treatments, the laboratory findings at ICU admission, and clinical outcomes were collected. The chest computerized tomography (CT) of the patients were evaluated specifically for COVID-19 and CT score was calculated. Data of the survivors and nonsurvivors were compared with survival analysis to identify risk factors of mortality in the ICU.
   Results: The mean age of the patients was 71.1 +/- 14.1 years. The patients were predominantly male. The most common comorbidity in patients was hypertension. ICU mortality was 62.8%. Being over 60 years old, CT score >= 15, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score > 15, having dementia, treatment without favipiravir, base excess in blood gas analysis s -2.0, WBC > 10,000/mm(3), D-dimer > 1.6 mu g/mL troponin > 24 ng/L, Na >= 145 mmo1/L were considered to link with ICU mortality according to Kaplan-Meier curves (log-rank test, p < 0.05). The APACHE II score (HR: 1.055, 95% Cl: 1.021-1.090) and chest CT score (HR: 2.411, 95% CI:1.193-4.875) were associated with ICU mortality in the cox proportional-hazard regression model adjusted for age, dementia, favipiravir treatment and troponin. Howewer, no difference was found between survivors and nonsurvivors in terms of intubation timing.
   Conclusions: COVID-19 patients have a high ICU admission and mortality rate. Studies in the ICU are also crucial in this respect. In our study, we investigated the ICU mortality risk factors of COVID-19 patients. We determined a predictive mortality model consisting of APACHE II score and chest CT score. It was thought that this feasible and practical model would assist in making clinical decisions.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of the Treatment of COVID-19 with Multicriteria Decision-Making Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
AB  - Objectives. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019. Until now, many drugs and methods have been used in the treatment of the disease. However, no effective treatment option has been found and only case-based successes have been achieved so far. This study aims to evaluate COVID-19 treatment options using multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. Methods. In this study, we evaluated the available COVID-19 treatment options by MCDM techniques, namely, fuzzy PROMETHEE and VIKOR. These techniques are based on the evaluation and comparison of complex and multiple criteria to evaluate the most appropriate alternative. We evaluated current treatment options including favipiravir (FPV), lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, interleukin-1 blocker, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and plasma exchange. The criteria used for the analysis include side effects, method of administration of the drug, cost, turnover of plasma, level of fever, age, pregnancy, and kidney function. Results. The results showed that plasma exchange was the most preferred alternative, followed by FPV and IVIG, while hydroxychloroquine was the least favorable one. New alternatives could be considered once they are available, and weights could be assigned based on the opinions of the decision-makers (physicians/clinicians). The treatment methods that we evaluated with MCDM methods will be beneficial for both healthcare users and to rapidly end the global pandemic. The proposed method is applicable for analyzing the alternatives to the selection problem with quantitative and qualitative data. In addition, it allows the decision-maker to define the problem simply under uncertainty. Conclusions. Fuzzy PROMETHEE and VIKOR techniques are applied in aiding decision-makers in choosing the right treatment technique for the management of COVID-19.

TI  - Favipiravir exposure and pregnancy outcome of COVID-19 patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading disease and many people have been infected in a short time. Favipiravir is under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19 and given to patients in many countries following emergency use approval. Based on data from animal studies, favipiravir use is contraindicated during pregnancy. Currently, there is no human data except for a single case report on use of favipiravir in pregnancy.
   Study design: This article includes the outcomes of 29 pregnancies reported to the Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology Unit regarding favipiravir use in pregnancy. For drug risk assessment, maternal characteristics were obtained at first contact. After the expected day of delivery, follow-up is conducted by phone call and all relevant data regarding pregnancy and newborn outcome were documented.
   Results: Of the 29 pregnancies exposed to favipiravir, 5 were electively terminated and 24 resulted in live birth. There were no miscarriages or no stillbirths. There were 25 live births including one pair of twins. Three children were born premature, and one infant had patent foramen ovale. Birth weights, lengths and head circumferences of all infants were within normal range.
   Conclusion: The results of the study indicate that favipiravir is unlikely to be a major human teratogen, but experience is still limited for a well-grounded risk assessment. Although these findings may be useful for the physicians and patients, larger studies are needed due to small number of cases. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Development of a Diamond Nanoparticles-based Nanosensor for Detection and Determination of Antiviral Drug Favipiravir
T2  - ELECTROANALYSIS
AB  - This study developed a nanosensor for the detection and determination of favipiravir, a presumed drug that has potential therapeutic efficacy in treating COVID-19 patients, from tablets and serum samples. This nanosensor was obtained by adding the optimum amount of diamond nanoparticles into carbon paste. For the determination of favipiravir adsorptive stripping differential pulse (AdSDPV) and adsorptive stripping square wave voltammetry (AdSSWV) were used. Limit of detection values were found as 4.83 x 10(-9) M and 2.44 x 10' M for bulk and 5.18 x 10(-8) M and 4.38 x 10(-8) M for serum samples using AdSDPV and AdSSWV, respectively. Recovery studies made of the tablet and serum produced satisfactory results.

TI  - Clinical profiles and outcome of patients with COVID-19 in a specialized hospital in Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA
AB  - Purpose To characterize the clinical features and outcome of patients treated at a specialized hospital for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods We retrospectively reviewed the symptoms on admission, treatment, and outcome of a total of 300 patients with mild (peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) >= 96%), moderate I (93% < SpO(2) < 96%), moderate II (SpO(2) <= 93%) and severe (requiring admission to the ICU or mechanical ventilation) COVID-19. Results Median age was 53 (interquartile range [IQR] 33-72) years and 57% was male. The number of patients with mild, moderate I, II and severe condition was 85, 138, 61 and 16, respectively. Common presenting symptoms were cough (n = 71), loss of taste (42), loss of smell (39), fever >= 37.5 degrees C (36). Dyspnea was observed only 21 cases; 57 reported no symptoms on admission. Favipiravir, ciclesonide, dexamethasone, and heparin were administered in 106, 168, 65, and 38 patients, respectively, but not remdesivir. The median duration of hospitalization was 10 (7-15) days. All patients with mild and moderate I severity were discharged. Among the 77 patients classified as moderate II or severe, 3 were transferred to tertiary hospitals for further treatment on the day of admission. The respiratory condition worsened in 21 patients; 18 required transfer to tertiary hospitals 3 (median) days after admission and 3 died. Conclusion Respiratory condition recovered in 92%; whereas it worsened in 7% and the mortality rate was 1%. The ratios of male patients, of patients with diabetes mellitus in those with the decreased respiratory condition, were significantly higher than recovered.

TI  - Effectiveness of Early Favipiravir Therapy in Hospitalised COVID-19 Patients
T2  - ADVANCES IN VIROLOGY
AB  - COVID-19 is a disease caused by a novel coronavirus with no specific, standard treatment. We investigated the clinical data of COVID-19 patients admitted to King Fahad Specialist Hospital (KFSH) in Buraydah by comparing the patients who were treated early with favipiravir (within 3 days of admission) to patients who were treated after three days of admission or not treated. 165 patients were confirmed with PCR tests and admitted to KFSH for treatment. Comorbidities contributed significantly to in-creasing the length of stay in hospital at 11.4 +/- 0.8 days compared to patients with no comorbidities at 8.6 +/- 0.9 days (p = 0.041). A total of 103 patients were treated with favipiravir, and we found that early treatment with favipiravir (within 3 days) reduced the length of stay in hospital significantly (8.8 +/- 1.4 days) compared to patients who were treated after 3 days (13.3 +/- 4.6 days) (p = 0.0015). Moreover, patients with comorbidities in both early and late treatment groups had significantly higher average lengths of stay in hospital (11.2 +/- 0.9 days) compared to patients with no comorbidities (7.9 +/- 0.7 days) (p = 0.017). Interestingly, patients treated early with favipiravir (with comorbidities and without) stayed fewer days in hospital compared to those with late treatment (p = 0.021; a difference of 4.5 +/- 1.9 days; and p = 0.018; a difference of 4.2 +/- 1.7 days, respectively). In conclusion, our analysis indicates that early treatment with favipiravir can reduce the length of stay in hospital and improve clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of favipiravir plus interferon-beta versus lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon-beta in moderately ill patients with COVID-19: A randomized clinical trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
AB  - Favipiravir (FVP), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV), and interferon-beta (INF-beta) are considered as potential treatments for COVID-19. We examined the efficacy and safety of FVP and INF-beta compared to LPV/RTV and INF-beta combinations for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. It was a single-center randomized clinical trial. Eligible patients were randomized to receive FVP plus INF-beta versus LPV/RTV plus INF-beta. The primary endpoint was the viral clearance after seven days of randomization. ICU admission, length of stay (LOS) in hospital, in-hospital mortality, and the incidence of adverse events were also measured. This trial was registered on the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20200506047323N3). Patients were randomly allocated to the FVP (n = 33) and LPV/RTV (n = 33) groups. The viral clearance on Day seven was not significantly different between the FVP (31.1%) and the LPV/RTV groups (16.1%). The rate of ICU admission and likewise the in-hospital mortality in the FVP group (12.5% and 6.3%, respectively) were similar to the LPV/RTV groups (19.4% and 19.4%, respectively). The median LOS in the hospital was also not different (6.8 days [interquartile range; IQR = 5.0-11.0] in the FVP and (8.0 days [IQR = 5.5-12.5]) in LPV/RTV groups (p = 0.140). Adverse events were observed in 25.0% of FVP and 32.3% of LPV/RTV groups. The combination therapy with FVP did not exert a higher efficacy compared to the combination regimen of LPV/RTV. However, both treatment regimens demonstrated a mild profile of adverse events.

TI  - A Validated high Performance Liquid Chromatographic Method for the Quantification of Favipiravir by PDA Detector
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCE AND PHARMA RESEARCH
AB  - Favipiravir is an antiviral agent showing activity for the treatment of various life threatening viruses such as Ebola virus, Lassa virus and also recent virus for COVID-19. It is a pyrazine carboxamide derivative with activity against RNA viruses which targets RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymes which are necessary for the transcription and replication of viral genomes. The lack of research work and no compendial methods available for the estimation of this drug influenced the current research investigation to give a simple, sensitive, rapid, precise, accurate and robust isocratic high performance liquid chromatographic and UV Spectroscopic method for the determination and quantification of Favipiravir. The elution was done by using SHIMADZU Prominence-i, LC-2030 C system equipped with Shim-Pack GIST C18 (250X 4.6 mm, 5 mu m) column with a mobile phase mixture of 10 mM potassium dihydrogen ortho phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) and acetonitrile in the ratio of 90:10 v/v at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The ultraviolet detection was done at the wavelength of 315 nm by maintaining column temperature at 30 degrees. The total run time was 8.0 min. Calibration plot showed best regression over the concentration range of 10-60 mu g/ml of Favipiravir standard solutions. The LOD and LOQ was found to be 0.18 mu g/ml and 0.53 mu g/ml, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was determined by performing recovery studies and was found to be between 99.47-100.80%. The repeatability testing for both sample and standard solutions was found as %RSD<2.0% which is within the acceptable limits showing that the method is precise as well. The proposed method was successfully applied for the marketed formulations of Favipiravir tablets. In addition the main features of the proposed method are economic and eco-friendly with less retention time around 4.622 min.

TI  - The "sex gap" in COVID-19 trials: a scoping review
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Many studies investigate the role of pharmacological treatments on disease course in Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Sex disparities in genetics, immunological responses, and hormonal mechanisms may underlie the substantially higher fatality rates reported in male COVID-19 patients. To optimise care for COVID-19 patients, prophylactic and therapeutic studies should include sex-specific design and analyses. Therefore, in this scoping review, we investigated whether studies on pharmacological treatment in COVID-19 were performed based on a priori sex-specific design or post-hoc sex-specific analyses.
   Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, UpToDate, clinical trial.org, and MedRxiv for studies on pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 until June 6th, 2020. We included case series, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies in humans (>= 18 years) investigating antiviral, antimalarial, and immune system modulating drugs. Data were collected on 1) the proportion of included females, 2) whether sex stratification was performed (a priori by design or post-hoc), and 3) whether effect modification by sex was investigated.
   Findings: 30 studies were eligible for inclusion, investigating remdesivir (n = 2), lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 5), favipiravir (n = 1), umifenovir (n = 1), hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (n = 8), convalescent plasma (n = 6), interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway inhibitors (n = 5), interleukin-1 (IL-1) pathway inhibitors (n = 1) and corticosteroids (n = 3). Only one study stratified its data based on sex in a post-hoc analysis, whereas none did a priori by design. None of the studies investigated effect modification by sex. A quarter of the studies included twice as many males as females.
   Interpretation: Analyses assessing potential interference of sex with (side-)effects of pharmacological therapy for COVID-19 are rarely reported. Considering sex differences in case-fatality rates and genetic, immunological, and hormonal mechanisms, studies should include sex-specific analyses in their design to optimise COVID-19 care.

TI  - Newly developed artificial intelligence algorithm for COVID-19 pneumonia: utility of quantitative CT texture analysis for prediction of favipiravir treatment effect
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose Using CT findings from a prospective, randomized, open-label multicenter trial of favipiravir treatment of COVID-19 patients, the purpose of this study was to compare the utility of machine learning (ML)-based algorithm with that of CT-determined disease severity score and time from disease onset to CT (i.e., time until CT) in this setting. Materials and methods From March to May 2020, 32 COVID-19 patients underwent initial chest CT before enrollment were evaluated in this study. Eighteen patients were randomized to start favipiravir on day 1 (early treatment group), and 14 patients on day 6 of study participation (late treatment group). In this study, percentages of ground-glass opacity (GGO), reticulation, consolidation, emphysema, honeycomb, and nodular lesion volumes were calculated as quantitative indexes by means of the software, while CT-determined disease severity was also visually scored. Next, univariate and stepwise regression analyses were performed to determine relationships between quantitative indexes and time until CT. Moreover, patient outcomes determined as viral clearance in the first 6 days and duration of fever were compared for those who started therapy within 4, 5, or 6 days as time until CT and those who started later by means of the Kaplan-Meier method followed by Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. Results % GGO and % consolidation showed significant correlations with time until CT (p < 0.05), and stepwise regression analyses identified both indexes as significant descriptors for time until CT (p < 0.05). When divided all patients between time until CT of 4 days and that of more than 4 days, accuracy of the combined quantitative method (87.5%) was significantly higher than that of the CT disease severity score (62.5%, p = 0.008). Conclusion ML-based CT texture analysis is equally or more useful for predicting time until CT for favipiravir treatment on COVID-19 patients than CT disease severity score.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of Nafamostat Mesylate in combination with Favipiravir for COVID-19 pneumonia treatment review article
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
AB  - Alleviation and treatment of the extensive detrimental implications of COVID-19 have materialised into the primary objectives of scientists and virologists along with pathologists assigned with the responsibility of provisioning of care for infected patients. Development and introduction of vaccines have been, till to date, primarily at the prototypical phase. The significance of utilisation of combined drug therapies has been considered to be paramount from the perspective of application of clinical information collected from previous viral epidemics. One prospective treatment application has involved the Multi Drug Therapy (MDT) based approach with utilisation of the combination of drugs Nafamostat Mesylate and Favipiravir with the purpose of reduction of the infectious intensity of COVID-19 viral strain. On account of the extensive prevalence of patients becoming infected with the Novel Coronavirus strain, MDT procedures have been mostly favoured by scientists and clinical virologists with the explicit objective of determination of the probability of such combined drug therapies in terms of assisting the recovery of COVID-19 infected patients.
   The previous researches conducted on the procedural particulars of treatments regarding effective antidote development for COVID-19 infected patients had brought forth various clinical outcomes on such innovative treatment initiatives concerning the observed effects of MDTs on such patients. The corresponding research literature review endeavour has been oriented towards collecting information regarding 2 specifically utilised medicinal substances (the previously mentioned Nafamostat Mesylate and Favipiravir drugs) for treatment purposes of COVID-19 infected individuals. Such drugs generally are associated with pharmaceutical categories such as antivirals, immune modulators, antibiotics and anticoagulants. These compounds have been utilised in a direct manner by hospital inpatients and such occurrences have permitted the researchers to examine the implications of such drugs on health conditions of COVID-19 patients in laboratory conditions as well. The corresponding study has been responsible for considering the clinical research findings of the combination of such drugs through comparison of observed outcomes.

TI  - Multivariate Optimization for Determination of Favipiravir, a SARS-CoV-2 Molecule, by the Reverse-Phase Liquid Chromatographic Method Using a QbD Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHIC SCIENCE
AB  - The object of the analytical work is to develop an analytical multivariate optimization for the determination of Favipiravir (FAV), a SARS-CoV-2 molecule, by the reverse-phase liquid chromatographic method using the analytical quality by design approach. FAV is used as an antiviral drug. Box-Behnken design is utilized for the optimization of the experiment and to identify the critical method parameters like the volume of acetonitrile, temperature and flow rate. Further, these factors are used to design the suitable mathematical models and illustrate their effect on various responses. This newly developed method utilized C18 column (5 mu m, 100 x 4.6 mm) and a temperature of 40 degrees C with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The mobile phase is composed of acetonitrile and ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4), in the ratio of 20:80v/v and the wavelength of HPLC UV-Detector was fixed to 323nm. This method is validated according to International Council for Harmonization Q2 (R1) guidelines. The System suitability is performed and the retention time of Favipiravir is 3.4min. The linearity range is obtained at 0.062 - 4 mu g/mL with a correlation coefficient (r2 = 0.9979). The recovery is found to be in the range of 98.84-100%. Thus, the intended method is found to be simple and robust.

TI  - COVID-19 related treatment and outcomes among COVID-19 ICU patients: A retrospective cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic remains an immediate and present concern, yet as of now there is still no approved therapeutic available for the treatment of COVID-19.This study aimed to investigate and report evidence concerning demographic characteristics and currently-used medications that contribute to the ultimate outcomes of COVID-19 ICU patients.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among all COVID-19 patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Asir Central Hospital in Saudi Arabia between the 1st and 30th of June 2020. Data extracted from patients' medical records included their demographics, home medications, medications used to treat COVID-19, treatment durations, ICU stay, hospital stay, and ultimate outcome (recovery or death).Descriptive statistics and regression modelling were used to analyze and compare the results. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees at both Asir Central Hospital and King Khalid University.
   Results: A total of 118 patients with median age of 57 years having definite clinical and disease outcomes were included in the study. Male patients accounted for 87% of the study population, and more than 65% experienced at least one comorbidity. The mean hospital and ICU stay was 11.4 and 9.8 days, respectively. The most common drugs used were tocilizumab (31.4%), triple combination therapy (45.8%), favipiravir (56.8%), dexamethasone (86.7%), and enoxaparin (83%). Treatment with enoxaparin significantly reduced the length of ICU stay (p = 0.04) and was found to be associated with mortality reduction in patients aged 50-75 (p = 0.03), whereas the triple regimen therapy and tocilizumab significantly increased the length of ICU stay in all patients (p = 0.01, p = 0.02 respectively).
   Conclusion: COVID-19 tends to affect males more significantly than females. The use of enoxaparin is an important part of COVID-19 treatment, especially for those above 50 years of age, while the use of triple combination therapy and tocilizumab in COVID-19 protocols should be reevaluated and restricted to patients who have high likelihood of benefit.

TI  - Spectrofluorimetric quantitative analysis of favipiravir, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine in spiked human plasma
T2  - SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY
AB  - Favipiravir, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine have been suggested in COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel of many countries. Synchronous spectrofluorometric measurement provides sensitive tool for resolving the overlapped spectra of multicomponent drugs through converting the wider spectra to narrower sharp spectra. This work introduces the first fluorescence spectroscopic method for quantitative analysis of favipiravir, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine in spiked human plasma. Testing the fluorescence spectra of favipiravir, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine shows severe overlap, which hinders the direct quantification of the cited drugs. To overcome the overlapping issue, the drugs under the study have been measured in the synchronous mode at Delta lambda = 60 nm. Favipiravir could be measured directly at 423 nm without interference of remdesivir or hydroxychloroquine. Synchronous measuring the cited drugs at Delta lambda = 130 nm with mathematical transforming to the first order derivative spectra allowing remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine at 384 nm and 394 nm, respectively without interference from favipiravir. Different factors affecting the spectrofluorometric measurement process have been verified. The drugs under the study have been successfully quantitatively analyzed in the spiked plasma using the proposed method.

TI  - The association of antiviral drugs with COVID-19 morbidity: The retrospective analysis of a nationwide COVID-19 cohort
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background and objectivesAlthough several repurposed antiviral drugs have been used for the treatment of COVID-19, only a few such as remdesivir and molnupiravir have shown promising effects. The objectives of our study were to investigate the association of repurposed antiviral drugs with COVID-19 morbidity. MethodsPatients admitted to 26 different hospitals located in 16 different provinces between March 11-July 18, 2020, were enrolled. Case definition was based on WHO criteria. Patients were managed according to the guidelines by Scientific Board of Ministry of Health of Turkey. Primary outcomes were length of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) requirement, and intubation. ResultsWe retrospectively evaluated 1,472 COVID-19 adult patients; 57.1% were men (mean age = 51.9 +/- 17.7years). A total of 210 (14.3%) had severe pneumonia, 115 (7.8%) were admitted to ICUs, and 69 (4.7%) were intubated during hospitalization. The median (interquartile range) of duration of hospitalization, including ICU admission, was 7 (5-12) days. Favipiravir (n = 328), lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 55), and oseltamivir (n = 761) were administered as antiviral agents, and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, n = 1,382) and azithromycin (n = 738) were used for their immunomodulatory activity. Lopinavir/ritonavir (beta [95% CI]: 4.71 [2.31-7.11]; p = 0.001), favipiravir (beta [95% CI]: 3.55 [2.56-4.55]; p = 0.001) and HCQ (beta [95% CI]: 0.84 [0.02-1.67]; p = 0.046) were associated with increased risk of lengthy hospital stays. Furthermore, favipiravir was associated with increased risks of ICU admission (OR [95% CI]: 3.02 [1.70-5.35]; p = 0.001) and invasive mechanical ventilation requirement (OR [95% CI]: 2.94 [1.28-6.75]; p = 0.011). ConclusionOur findings demonstrated that antiviral drugs including lopinavir, ritonavir, and favipiravir were associated with negative clinical outcomes such as increased risks for lengthy hospital stay, ICU admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation requirement. Therefore, repurposing such agents without proven clinical evidence might not be the best approach for COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Effect of COVID-19 medications on corrected QT interval and induction of torsade de pointes: Results of a multicenter national survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Background There are some data showing that repurposed drugs used for the Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) have potential to increase the risk of QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes (TdP), and these arrhythmic side effects have not been adequately addressed in COVID-19 patients treated with these repurposed medications.
   Methods This is the prospective study of 2403 patients hospitalised at 13 hospitals within the COVID-19 epicentres of the Iran. These patients were treated with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, favipiravir and remdesivir alone or in combination with azithromycin. The primary outcome of the study was incidence of critical QTc prolongation, and secondary outcomes were incidences of TdP and death.
   Results Of the 2403 patients, 2365 met inclusion criteria. The primary outcome of QTc >= 500 ms and increment QTc >= 60 ms was observed in 11.2% and 17.6% of the patients, respectively. The secondary outcomes of TdP and death were reported in 0.38% and 9.8% of the patients, respectively. The risk of critical QT prolongation increased in the presence of female gender, history of heart failure, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin combination therapy, simultaneous furosemide or beta-blocker therapy and acute renal or hepatic dysfunction. However, the risk of TdP was predicted by treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir, simultaneous amiodarone or furosemide administration and hypokalaemia during treatment.
   Conclusion This cohort showed significant QTc prolongation with all COVID-19 medications studied, however, life-threatening arrhythmia of TdP occurred rarely. Among the repurposed drugs studied, hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir alone or in combination with azithromycin clearly demonstrated to increase the risk of critical QT prolongation and/or TdP.

TI  - RETRACTED: Antiviral treatment could not provide clinical benefit in management of mild COVID-19: A Retrospective Experience from Field hospital (Retracted article. See vol. 15, pg. 835, 2022)
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 145 million infected people and 3 million deaths worldwide. There has been limited data to recommend either for or against use of antiviral regimens in mild COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes between mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral drugs and those without. Method: Thai patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at field hospital affiliated to Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand were evaluated between January 1, 2020 and April 13, 2021. Patients' data, clinical presentation, past medical history, laboratory results, and treatment outcomes were extensively reviewed. Results: Five hundred patients with positive tests were included in the study. The mean age was 35.9 years; 46% males. There were 225 (45%), 207 (41.4%), 44 (8.8%), 18 (3.6%), 6 (1.2%) patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19, respectively. Of 207 mild COVID-19 patients, 9 (4.3%) received lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir, 17 (8.2%) received favipiravir, while 175 (84.5%) had only supportive care. Mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral treatment had longer median length of hospital stay [13 days (IQR 11-14) vs. 10 days (IQR 8-12), p < 0.001] than patients having only supportive treatment. Antiviral drug use was significantly associated with longer hospital stay (>10 days) in mild COVID-19 patients (OR 5.52; 95%CI 2.12-14.40, p < 0.001). Adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hepatitis were also demonstrated in our COVID-19 patients with antiviral treatments. Majority of patients (97.6%) recovered without any complications and were discharged home. Two deaths were caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome from severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusion: Antiviral treatment could not provide superior clinical outcomes to supportive care in mild COVID-19 patients. Mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral medication had longer length of hospital stay than those without. Standard supportive care and regular monitoring of disease progression might be keys for successful management of mild COVID-19. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Pharmacogenomics and COVID-19: clinical implications of human genome interactions with repurposed drugs
T2  - PHARMACOGENOMICS JOURNAL
AB  - The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an emergent global pandemic. Many drugs without established efficacy are being used to treat COVID-19 patients either as an offlabel/compassionate use or as a clinical trial. Although drug repurposing is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost, there is a need to make predictions on success before the start of therapy. For the optimum use of these repurposed drugs, many factors should be considered such as drug-gene or dug-drug interactions, drug toxicity, and patient co-morbidity. There is limited data on the pharmacogenomics of these agents and this may constitute an obstacle for successful COVID-19 therapy. This article reviewed the available human genome interactions with some promising repurposed drugs for COVID-19 management. These drugs include chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), atazanavir (ATV), favipiravir (FVP), nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), oseltamivir, remdesivir, anakinra, tocilizumab (TCZ), eculizumab, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) regulators, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide. Drug-gene variant pairs that may alter the therapeutic outcomes in COVID-19 patients are presented. The major drug variant pairs that associated with variations in clinical efficacy include CQ/HCQ (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, ACE2, and HO-1); azithromycin (ABCB1); LPV/r (SLCO1B1, ABCB1, ABCC2 and CYP3A); NVP (ABCC10); oseltamivir (CES1 and ABCB1); remdesivir (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and OATP1B1); anakinra (IL-1a); and TCZ (IL6R and FCGR3A). The major drug variant pairs that associated with variations in adverse effects include CQ/HCQ (G6PD; hemolysis and ABCA4; retinopathy), ATV (MDR1 and UGT1A1*28; hyperbilirubinemia; and APOA5; dyslipidemia), NVP (HLA-DRB1*01, HLA-B*3505 and CYP2B6; skin rash and MDR1; hepatotoxicity), and EFV (CYP2B6; depression and suicidal tendencies).

TI  - Favipiravir-induced cutaneous adverse reactions in patients infected with COVID-19
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Favipiravir (FVP) has been used for treatment of COVID-19 in many countries. We analysed the incidence of FVP-induced cutaneous adverse reactions (CARs) in patients infected with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, a principal centre of emerging infectious disease in Thailand, and who presented with cutaneous eruption following FVP prescription. We identified five cases of FVP-induced CARs: two patients with maculopapular rash, two with urticarial rash, and one with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The median interval between FVP treatment and rash occurrence was 7 days and the mean duration of the rash was 5 days. This report highlights that FVP can induce CARs, particularly eruptions, in COVID-19-infected patients. Clinicians should be aware of this possible drug-related allergy, and it should be excluded as a cause of rash during FVP treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Hydroxychloroquine shortened hospital stay and reduced intensive care unit admissions in hospitalized COVID-19 patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB  - Introduction: Effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 has been highly controversial. In our research, we aimed to investigate the effects of hydroxychloroquine on disease outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methodology: A total of 393 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively assigned to the standard of care therapy group (n = 180) or the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group (n = 213). The standard of care therapy comprised favipiravir, low molecular weight heparin, acetylsalicylic acid. Status of oxygenation at baseline and on the seventh day, laboratory tests at baseline and at discharge were recorded. Length of hospital stay, administration of anti-inflammatory treatment, admission to the intensive care unit and 28th day mortality were set as primary endpoints. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of oxygen delivery route and mortality after seven days of treatment (p = 0.592). C-reactive protein levels of the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group were significantly lower than that of the standard of care group at discharge (p = 0.034). Patients in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group had shorter hospital stay (p = 0.007). The standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was favored over standard of care group in terms of rate of intensive care unit admissions (21.7% vs. 10.8%; relative risk with 95% CI = 0.49 [0.31-0.80], p = 0.003). Conclusions: Hydroxychloroquine in addition to standard of care was associated with less intensive care unit admissions, early discharge and greater C-reactive protein reduction. There was no difference in 28-day mortality.

TI  - Quantum chemical studies on the binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein: human ACE2 interface complex
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - A two-layer ONIOM(B3LYP/6-31G*:PM7) method is used to model the binding of several drug/drug-like molecules (L) at the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein: human ACE2 protein interface cavity. The selected molecules include a set of thirty-five ligands from the study of Smith and Smith which showed a high docking score in the range of -7.0 to -7.7 kcal/mol and another set of seven repurposing drugs, viz. favipiravir, remdesivir, EIDD, galidesivir, triazavirin, ruxolitinib, and baricitinib. The ONIOM model of the cavity (M) showed a highly polarized electron distribution along its top-to-bottom direction while Ls with lengths in the range 1.0 - 1.5 nm fitted well inside the cavity in a head-to-tail fashion to yield ML complexes. The ligands showed a large variation in the ONIOM-level binding energy (E-b), in the range -2.7 to -85.4 kcal/mol. The E-b of ML complexes better than -40.0 kcal/mol is observed for myricetin, fidarestat, protirelin, m-digallic acid, glucogallin, benserazide hydrochlorideseradie, remdesivir, tazobactum, sapropterin, nitrofurantoin, quinonoid, pyruvic acid calcium isoniazid, and aspartame, and among them the highest E-b -85.4 kcal/mol is observed for myricetin. A hydroxy substitution is suggested for the phenyl ring of aspartame to improve its binding behavior at the cavity, and the resulting ligand 43 showed the best E-b -84.5 kcal/mol. The ONIOM-level study is found to be effective for the interpretation of the noncovalent interactions resulting from residues such as arginine, histidine, tyrosine, lysine, carboxylate, and amide moieties in the active site and suggests rational design strategies for COVID-19 drug development.

TI  - Visual classification of three computed tomography lung patterns to predict prognosis of COVID-19: a retrospective study
T2  - BMC PULMONARY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Quantitative evaluation of radiographic images has been developed and suggested for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there are limited opportunities to use these image-based diagnostic indices in clinical practice. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the utility of a novel visually-based classification of pulmonary findings from computed tomography (CT) images of COVID-19 patients with the following three patterns defined: peripheral, multifocal, and diffuse findings of pneumonia. We also evaluated the prognostic value of this classification to predict the severity of COVID-19. Methods This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between January 1st and September 30(th), 2020, who presented with suspicious findings on CT lung images at admission (n = 69). We compared the association between the three predefined patterns (peripheral, multifocal, and diffuse), admission to the intensive care unit, tracheal intubation, and death. We tested quantitative CT analysis as an outcome predictor for COVID-19. Quantitative CT analysis was performed using a semi-automated method (Thoracic Volume Computer-Assisted Reading software, GE Health care, United States). Lungs were divided by Hounsfield unit intervals. Compromised lung (%CL) volume was the sum of poorly and non-aerated volumes (- 500, 100 HU). We collected patient clinical data, including demographic and clinical variables at the time of admission. Results Patients with a diffuse pattern were intubated more frequently and for a longer duration than patients with a peripheral or multifocal pattern. The following clinical variables were significantly different between the diffuse pattern and peripheral and multifocal groups: body temperature (p = 0.04), lymphocyte count (p = 0.01), neutrophil count (p = 0.02), c-reactive protein (p < 0.01), lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.01), Krebs von den Lungen-6 antigen (p < 0.01), D-dimer (p < 0.01), and steroid (p = 0.01) and favipiravir (p = 0.03) administration. Conclusions Our simple visual assessment of CT images can predict the severity of illness, a resulting decrease in respiratory function, and the need for supplemental respiratory ventilation among patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Predictive medicinal metabolites from Momordica dioica against comorbidity related proteins of SARS-CoV-2 infections
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - Momordica dioica have proven medicinal potential of antidiabetic, antiviral and immune stimulating properties. Flavonoids and triterpenoids from M. dioica were more extensively investigated for antiviral, antidiabetic and immunomodulatory activities. In this present study, we have predicted the reported bioactive flavonoids and triterpenoids of the plant against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike protein, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4) receptor through molecular docking and in silico ADME predictions methods. According to the binding affinities, the two triterpenoids, hederagenin and oleanolic acid exhibited the best docking scores with these proteins than the catechin and quercetin with compared to standard remdesivir, favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. The in vitro protein-drug studies have also showed significant interaction of catechin and quercetin compounds than standard drugs. The in silico binding studies correlated with the in silico binding studies. Further, M. dioica being used as antidiabetic and its metabolite had significant interaction with DDP4, a comorbidity protein involved in aiding the viral entry. Out of all the natural ligands, quercetin was reported relatively good and safe for humans with high gastrointestinal tract permeability and poor blood brain barrier crossing abilities. Hence, M. dioica phytocompounds reflects promising therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 infections under comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and kidney disorders.

TI  - Evaluation of Nail Findings in Patients with COVID-19 History and Wood's Lamp Examination
T2  - SKIN APPENDAGE DISORDERS
AB  - Introduction: Various skin findings due to coronavirus have been identified. There are a few case reports on nail findings after coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. We aimed to document the nail findings of the COVID-19 survivors and shed light on the interesting luminescence seen under the Wood's light.
   Methods: One hundred and seventy-four patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in the last 100 days were grouped in terms of the agents used in the treatment. Fifty-seven volunteers without a history of infection were included.
   Results: Patients treated with favipiravir had a significantly higher positivity of luminescence (p: 0.0001). The most common nail findings in patients were splinter hemorrhage (13%), followed by leukonychia (12%) and longitudinal ridges (7.9%).
   Discussion/Conclusions: The luminescence may be seen due to the accumulation of favipiravir or its excipients (titanium dioxide and yellow ferric oxide) on the nails. Wood's lamp examination of the plasma taken from a patient after favipiravir's first dose revealed the same luminescence as we saw on the nails. Accordingly, this accumulation may be seen in the vital organs. Although our knowledge about the virus increases day by day, the potentially hazardous effects of the virus and long-term complications of the treatment options are still being investigated.

TI  - Remdesivir Strongly Binds to RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase, Membrane Protein, and Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2: Indication From Molecular Modeling and Simulations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Development of new drugs is a time-taking and expensive process. Comprehensive efforts are being made globally toward the search of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Several drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ritonavir, and lopinavir have been included in the treatment regimen and shown effective results in several cases. Among the existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, remdesivir is found to be more effective against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir has broad-spectrum antiviral action against many single-stranded RNA viruses including pathogenic SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In this study, we proposed that remdesivir strongly binds to membrane protein (Mprotein), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), and main protease (Mprotease) of SARS-CoV-2. It might show antiviral activity by inhibiting more than one target. It has been found that remdesivir binds to Mprotease, Mprotein, and RDRP with -7.8, -7.4, and -7.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The structure dynamics study suggested that binding of remdesivir leads to unfolding of RDRP. It has been found that strong binding of remdesivir to Mprotein leads to decrease in structural deviations and gyrations. Additionally, the average solvent-accessible surface area of Mprotein decreases from 127.17 to 112.12 nm(2), respectively. Furthermore, the eigenvalues and the trace of the covariance matrix were found to be low in case of Mprotease-remdesivir, Mprotein-remdesivir, and RDRP-remdesivir. Binding of remdesivir to Mprotease, Mprotein, and RDRP reduces the average motions in protein due to its strong binding. The MMPBSA calculations also suggested that remdesivir has strong binding affinity with Mprotein, Mprotease, and RDRP. The detailed analysis suggested that remdesivir has more than one target of SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Evaluation of COVID-19 Treatments in Iran in Comparison with Local Therapeutic Recommendations: A Population-Level Study on Utilization and Costs of Prescription Drugs
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PHARMACY PRACTICE
AB  - Objective: In this study, we assess population-level data of COVID-19 treatments in Iran compared to Ministry of Health (MOH)-published guidelines to gain a better insight into the quality of care for this disease. Methods: National sales data of each recommended and nonrecommended COVID-19 medicine were used to proxy utilization between March 21, 2020, and March 21, 2021, or Iranian year 1399. COVID-19-attributed sales volume and number of patients were estimated by adjusting sales data with pre-COVID-19 average growth rate, recommended dose, and duration of treatment. Next, they were compared with the MOH guidelines in outpatient and inpatient settings. Furthermore, the list of top 10 molecules of the market and top 10 COVID-19-indicated molecules in terms of values were extracted to assess the economic burden of COVID-19 prescription drugs and their share. Findings: The estimated number of patients receiving COVID-19 treatments in some outpatient medicines such as recommended hydroxychloroquine was over 2.2 million. Favipiravir and remdesivir were collectively about two inpatient medicines 260,000; however, neither of these two medicines was recommended in the MOH guidelines. In some fewer specific medicines such as dexamethasone, prednisolone, azithromycin, and naproxen, the estimated number of COVID-19-attributed patients were incomparable with the officially announced number of confirmed cases in the year of study, which could be related to nonconfirmed diagnosed cases, irrational use, or prescribing, or limitations of our data and study. The total COVID-19-attributed market of candidate medicines was over 15 trillion IR Rials (almost 4.3% of the total market). Remdesivir, with over 60% of the total COVID-19 attributed market, followed by favipiravir, was among the highest value medicines. Conclusion: Despite the release of the COVID-19 guideline by Iran MOH, misalignment in the enforcement of decisions was a serious weakness (cases of favipiravir and remdesivir). This weakness led to some economic burden on the health-care system and raised ethical concerns.

TI  - A case of successful treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia with favipiravir and tocilizumab in post-kidney transplant recipient
T2  - TRANSPLANT INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - We report a case of COVID-19 in kidney transplant patient in Thailand. A 58-year-old 2 years post-kidney transplant recipient, with maintenance immunosuppression of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisolone, presented with acute diarrhea which followed by fever on day 12. Symptoms of pneumonia together with lymphopenia from complete blood count were developed on day 7 after onset of fever with the x-ray finding of bilateral multifocal patchy infiltration. COVID-19 infection has been confirmed by reverse real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nasal swab as well as found in stool. Darunavir together with ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and favipiravir was initiated on the first day of admission at primary hospital. Patient has been transferred to our hospital on day 2 of admission in which tacrolimus together with MMF was discontinued. High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was required on days 4-5 of hospitalization. Tocilizumab was administered after rising of serum IL-6 level. Symptoms of pneumonia were improved in which no oxygen treatment required from day 10 of hospitalization. Drug interaction between tacrolimus and anti-viral treatment leads to severely high level of tacrolimus which caused reversible acute kidney injury (AKI) after supportive treatment.

TI  - Structure-based docking, pharmacokinetic evaluation, and molecular dynamics-guided evaluation of traditional formulation against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor bind domain and ACE2 receptor complex
T2  - CHEMICAL PAPERS
AB  - There is an urgent need for reliable cure and preventive measures in this hour of the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Siddha- and Ayurvedic-based classical formulations have antiviral properties and great potential therapeutic choice in this pandemic situation. In the current study, in silico-based analysis for the binding potential of phytoconstituents from the classical formulations suggested by the Ministry of Ayush (Kabasura Kudineer, Shwas Kuthar Rasa with Kantakari and pippali churna, Talisadi churna) to the interface domain of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was performed. Maestro software from Schrodinger and tools like Glide Docking, induced fit docking, MM-GBSA, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and thermal MM-GBSA was used to analyze the binding of protein PDB ID:6VW1 and the selected 133 ligands in comparison with drug molecules like favipiravir and ribavirin. QikProp-based ADMET evaluation of all the phytoconstituents found them nontoxic and with drug-like properties. Selection of top ten ligands was made based on docking score for further MM-GBSA analysis. After performing IFD of top five molecules iso-chlorogenic acid, taxiphyllin, vasicine, catechin and caffeic acid, MD simulation and thermal MM-GBSA were done. Iso-chlorogenic acid had formed more stable interaction with key residue among all phytoconstituents. Computational-based study has highlighted the potential of the many constituents of traditional medicine to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2, which might stop the viral entry into the cell. However, in vivo experiments and clinical trials are necessary for supporting this claim.

TI  - Innovative electrochemical sensor for the precise determination of the new antiviral COVID-19 treatment Favipiravir in the presence of coadministered drugs
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Due the current pandemic of COVID-19, an urgent need is required for serious medical treatments of a huge number of patients. The world health organization (WHO) approved Favipiravir (FAV) as a medication for patients infected with corona virus. In the current study, we report the first simple electrochemical, greatly sensitive sensor using MnO2-rGO nanocomposite for the accurate determination of Favipiravir (FAV). The developed sensor showed a high improvement in the electrochemical oxidation of FAV comparing to the unmodified screen-printed electrode (SPE). The suggested platform constituents and the electrochemical measurements parameters were studied. Under optimal experimental parameters, a current response to the concentration change of FAV was found to be in the linear range of 1.0 x 10-8-5.5 x 10-5 M at pH 7.0 with a limit of detection 0.11 mu M and a quantification limit of 0.33 mu M. The developed platform was confirmed by the precise analysis of FAV in real samples including dosage form and plasma. The developed platform can be applied in different fields of industry quality control and clinical analysis laboratories for the FAV determination.

TI  - Estimation and development of some biophysical characteristics of the drug Favipiravir used in the treatment of corona-virus using green chemistry technology
T2  - EURASIAN CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - This study included the preparation and identification of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuNPs) prepared from eucalyptus leaf extract using modern and advanced detection and analysis devices: XRD, AFM, SEM, UV-Vis, and TEM. The results of the tests indicated that the prepared particles are spherical and rodshaped, with average diameters ranging from 32.55-37.94 nm, and the results showed that the copper oxide nanoparticles were within the nano-scale, and the wavelength of the drug is (322) nanometers. The factors affecting the loading of the drug (Favipiravir) at a concentration of (40 mu g/mL) on the surface of activated charcoal prepared from eucalyptus leaves were studied, as well with a weight of 0.1 g and in the presence of copper oxide nanoparticles with different concentrations. It was found that the equilibrium time is 25 minutes, and the thermodynamic functions were calculated at different temperatures. The results illustrated that the loading process by using exothermic adsorption (physical adsorption), is less random process and spontaneously. The possibility of using the loaded substance (Favipiravir:CuNPs) to inhibit microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi was studied, and by the presence of the surface active substance sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS, it was found that it has the ability to inhibit by 100%, as a result of the merging of the tail of the superficial active substances with the fatty membrane of the virus, the other microorganisms, its dismantling, and encapsulation of its parts. The vaccines and therapeutic drugs developed on the basis of nano-medicine, which are currently undergoing clinical trials, have the potential to become innovative alternatives to defeat COVID-19 in the future.

TI  - Core-shell nanocomposite of flower-like molybdenum disulfide nanospheres and molecularly imprinted polymers for electrochemical detection of anti COVID-19 drug favipiravir in biological samples
T2  - MICROCHIMICA ACTA
AB  - A novel electrochemical sensor is reported for the detection of the antiviral drug favipiravir based on the core-shell nanocomposite of flower-like molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanospheres and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). The MoS2@MIP core-shell nanocomposite was prepared via the electrodeposition of a MIP layer on the MoS2 modified electrode, using o-phenylenediamine as the monomer and favipiravir as the template. The selective binding of target favipiravir at the MoS2@MIP core-shell nanocomposite produced a redox signal in a concentration dependent manner, which was used for the quantitative analysis. The preparation process of the MoS2@MIP core-shell nanocomposite was optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the sensor exhibited a wide linear response range of 0.01 similar to 100 nM (1.57*10(-6) similar to 1.57*10(-2) mu g mL(-1)) and a low detection limit of 0.002 nM (3.14*10(-7) mu g mL(-1)). Application of the sensor was demonstrated by detecting favipiravir in a minimum amount of 10 mu L biological samples (urine and plasma). Satisfied results in the recovery tests indicated a high potential of favipiravir monitoring in infectious COVID-19 samples.

TI  - Evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of adding ivermectin to treatment in severe COVID-19 patients
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background and objectivesAn effective treatment option is not yet available for SARS-CoV2, which causes the COVID-19 pandemic and whose effects are felt more and more every day. Ivermectin is among the drugs whose effectiveness in treatment has been investigated. In this study; it was aimed to investigate the presence of gene mutations that alter ivermectin metabolism and cause toxic effects in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ivermectin use in the treatment of patients without mutation.Materials and methodsPatients with severe COVID19 pneumonia were included in the study, which was planned as a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind phase 3 study. Two groups, the study group and the control group, took part in the study. Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg/day for 5 days in the form of a solution prepared for enteral use added to the reference treatment protocol -hydroxychloroquine + favipiravir + azithromycin- of patients included in the study group. Patients in the control group were given only reference treatment with 3 other drugs without ivermectin. The presence of mutations was investigated by performing sequence analysis in the mdr1/abcab1 gene with the Sanger method in patients included in the study group according to randomization. Patients with mutations were excluded from the study and ivermectin treatment was not continued. Patients were followed for 5days after treatment. At the end of the treatment and follow-up period, clinical response and changes in laboratory parameters were evaluated.ResultsA total of 66 patients, 36 in the study group and 30 in the control group were included in the study. Mutations affecting ivermectin metabolism was detected in genetic tests of six (16.7%) patients in the study group and they were excluded from the study. At the end of the 5-day follow-up period, the rate of clinical improvement was 73.3% (22/30) in the study group and was 53.3% (16/30) in the control group (p=0.10). At the end of the study, mortality developed in 6 patients (20%) in the study group and in 9 (30%) patients in the control group (p=0.37). At the end of the follow-up period, the average peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) values of the study and control groups were found to be 93.5 and 93.0%, respectively. Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/FiO2 ratios were determined as 236.385.7 and 220.8 +/- 127.3 in the study and control groups, respectively. While the blood lymphocyte count was higher in the study group compared to the control group (1698 +/- 1438 and 1256 +/- 710, respectively) at the end of the follow-up period (p=0.24); reduction in serum C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer levels was more pronounced in the study group (p=0.02, p=0.005 and p=0.03, respectively).Conclusions According to the findings obtained, ivermectin can provide an increase in clinical recovery, improvement in prognostic laboratory parameters and a decrease in mortality rates even when used in patients with severe COVID-19. Consequently, ivermectin should be considered as an alternative drug that can be used in the treatment of COVID-19 disease or as an additional option to existing protocols.

TI  - Efficacy of COVID-19 treatments among geriatric patients: a systematic review
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Introduction: A majority of the fatalities due to COVID-19 have been observed in those over the age of 60. There is no approved and universally accepted treatment for geriatric patients. The aim of this review is to assess the current literature on efficacy of COVID-19 treatments in geriatric populations.
   Methods: A systematic review search was conducted in PubMed, MedRxiv, and JAMA databases with the keywords COVID-19, geriatric, hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, budesonide, remdesivir, favipiravir, ritonavir, molnupiravir, tocilizumab, bamlanivimab, baricitinib, sotrovimab, fluvoxamine, convalescent plasma, prone position, or anticoagulation. Articles published from January 2019 to January 2022 with a population greater than or equal to 60 years of age were included. Interventions examined included hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, dexamethasone, budesonide, tocilizumab, bamlanivimab, baricitinib, sotrovimab, convalescent plasma, prone position, and anticoagulation therapy. Outcome measures included viral load, viral markers, ventilator-free days, or clinical improvement.
   Results: The search revealed 302 articles, 52 met inclusion criteria. Hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, and remdesivir revealed greater side effects or inefficiency in geriatric patients with COVID-19. Favipiravir, bamlanivimab, baricitinib, and supportive therapy showed a decrease in viral load and improvement of clinical symptoms. There is conflicting evidence with tocilizumab, convalescent plasma, and anticoagulant therapy in reducing mortality, ventilator-free days, and clinical improvements. In addition, there was limited evidence and lack of data due to ongoing trials for treatments with sotrovimab and budesonide.
   Conclusion: No agent is known to be effective for preventing COVID-19 after exposure to the virus. Further research is needed to ensure safety and efficacy of each of the reviewed interventions for older adults.

TI  - Characteristics of systematic reviews evaluating treatments for COVID-19 registered in PROSPERO
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - Characteristics and research collaboration of registered systematic reviews (SRs) on treatment modalities for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analysed research collaboration, interventions and outcome measures in registered SRs on COVID-19 treatments and pointed out the relevant problems. PROSPERO (international prospective register of systematic reviews) was searched for SRs on COVID-19 treatments as of 2 June 2020. Excel 2016 was used for descriptive analyses of the extracted data. VOSviewer 1.6.14 software was used to generate network maps for collaborations between countries and institutions. A total of 189 SRs were included, which were registered by 301 institutions from 39 countries. China (69, 36.50%) exhibited the highest output. Cooperation between countries was not close enough. As an institution, the Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (7, 3.70%) had the highest output. There was close cooperation between institutions. Interventions included antiviral therapy (81, 42.86%), respiratory support (16, 8.47%), circulatory support (11, 5.82%), plasma therapy for convalescent patients (11, 5.82%), immunotherapy (9, 4.76%), TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) treatment (9, 4.76%), rehabilitation treatment (5, 2.65%), anti-inflammatory treatment (16, 8.47%) and other treatments (31, 16.40%). Concerning antiviral therapy (81, 42.86%), the most commonly used antiviral agents were chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (26, 13.76%), followed by remdesivir (12, 6.35%), lobinavir/ritonavir (11, 5.82%), favipiravir (5, 2.65%), ribavirin (5, 2.65%), interferon (5, 2.65%), abiron (4, 2.12%) and abidor (4, 2.12%). The most frequently used primary and secondary outcomes were the mortality rate (92, 48.68%) and hospital stay length (48, 25.40%), respectively. The expression of the outcomes was not standardised. Many COVID-19 SRs on treatment modalities have been registered, with a low completion rate. Although there was some collaboration between countries and institutions in the currently registered SRs on treatment modalities for COVID-19 on PROSPERO, cooperation between countries should be further enhanced. More attention should be directed towards identifying deficiencies of outcome measures, and the standardisation of results should be maximised.

TI  - Rational Development of a Carrier-Free Dry Powder Inhalation Formulation for Respiratory Viral Infections via Quality by Design: A Drug-Drug Cocrystal of Favipiravir and Theophylline
T2  - PHARMACEUTICS
AB  - Formulating pharmaceutical cocrystals as inhalable dosage forms represents a unique niche in effective management of respiratory infections. Favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug with potential pharmacological activity against SARS-CoV-2, exhibits a low aqueous solubility. An ultra-high oral dose is essential, causing low patient compliance. This study reports a Quality-by-Design (QbD)-guided development of a carrier-free inhalable dry powder formulation containing a 1:1 favipiravir-theophylline (FAV-THP) cocrystal via spray drying, which may provide an alternative treatment strategy for individuals with concomitant influenza infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma. The cocrystal formation was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, and the construction of a temperature-composition phase diagram. A three-factor, two-level, full factorial design was employed to produce the optimized formulation and study the impact of critical processing parameters on the resulting median mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), fine particle fraction (FPF), and crystallinity of the spray-dried FAV-THP cocrystal. In general, a lower solute concentration and feed pump rate resulted in a smaller MMAD with a higher FPF. The optimized formulation (F1) demonstrated an MMAD of 2.93 mu m and an FPF of 79.3%, suitable for deep lung delivery with no in vitro cytotoxicity observed in A549 cells.

TI  - Remdesivir treatment for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background/aim: Remdesivir, which was first developed for the treatment of Ebola disease but failed to meet expectations, has become hope in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors for mortality and prognosis of adult moderate/severe COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir, and safety and tolerability of 5 days of remdesivir treatment.
   Materials and methods: This multicenter prospective observational study was conducted in 14 centers in Turkey. Pregnancy or breastfeeding, multiorgan failure, or usage of vasopressors for septic shock, ALT>5 x the upper limit of the normal range, or eGRF<30 mL/min or dialysis and receiving favipiravir were the exclusion criteria of the study.
   Results: Among 500 patients, 494 patients were included in the study. On admission, 392 (79.3%) patients had moderate and 102 (20.6%) patients had severe COVID-19. The 28-day mortality was 10.1%. The median of the scores of the seven-category ordinal scale assessed on days 0, 3, 5, 7 were 4 and 3 on day 14. When the survival status of the patients was evaluated according to the time between the remdesivir start date and the end date of the symptoms, no statistically significant difference was found between the medians of the groups (p = 0.404). In multivariable analysis, age (OR, 1.05; 95%CI, 1.02-1.08; p = 0.003), SpO(2) level on admission (OR, 3.03; 95%CI, 1.35-6.81; p = 0.007), heart rate (OR, 2.48; 95%CI, 1.01-6.07; p = 0.047), follow-up site at the hospital (clinic/ICU) (OR, 26.4; 95%CI, 11.6-60.17; p<0.001) were independently associated with increased mortality. Grade 3 adverse event (AE) was observed in 4 (0.8%) patients. None of the patients experienced grade 4 or 5 AEs.
   Conclusion: Remdesivir is a safe and well-tolerated drug and older age, low SpO(2) l evel on admission, tachycardia, and ICU admission are independently associated with increased mortality among patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 receiving remdesivir treatment.

TI  - Ritonavir may inhibit exoribonuclease activity of nsp14 from the SARS-CoV-2 virus and potentiate the activity of chain terminating drugs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB  - SARS-CoV-2is the causative agent for the ongoing COVID19 pandemic, and this virus belongs to the Coronaviridae family. The nsp14 protein of SARS-CoV-2 houses a 3' to 5' exoribonuclease activity responsible for removingmismatches that arise during genomeduplication. A homology model of nsp10-nsp14 complex was used to carry out in silico screening to identify molecules among natural products, or FDA approved drugs that can potentially inhibit the activity of nsp14. This exercise showed that ritonavir might bind to the exoribonuclease active site of the nsp14 protein. A model of the SARS-CoV-2-nsp10-nsp14 complex bound to substrate RNA showed that the ritonavir binding site overlaps with that of the 3' nucleotide of substrate RNA. A comparison of the calculated energies of binding for RNA and ritonavir suggested that the drug may bind to the active site of nsp14 with significant affinity. It is, therefore, possible that ritonavir may prevent association with substrate RNA and thus inhibit the exoribonuclease activity of nsp14. Overall, our computational studies suggest that ritonavir may serve as an effective inhibitor of the nsp14 protein. nsp14 is known to attenuate the inhibitory effect of drugs that function through premature termination of viral genome replication. Hence, ritonavir may potentiate the therapeutic properties of drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir and ribavirin. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - COVID-19 Pneumonia with Cavitation
T2  - FLORA INFEKSIYON HASTALIKLARI VE KLINIK MIKROBIYOLOJI DERGISI
AB  - The World Health Organization officially named the disease as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was caused by a new type of coronavirus that leads to viral pneumonia on 11 February 2020. Typical computed tomography findings of the disease are ground-glass infiltrations in both lungs. Atypical findings include lung cavitation and pleural effusion. A 43-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room with complaints of dry cough, fatigue, and joint pain for three days. Bilateral peripherally localized multisegmented ground-glass infiltrates were present in the first thorax tomography. A combined nasopharyngeal swab was taken from the patient and favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine treatment was initiated and she was sent home with the recommendation of isolation for 14 days. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test performed on the same day and confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. She was admitted to the hospital again with an increase in complaints five days after the first presentation and her oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) was found to be 90%. On the fifth day of her hospitalization, the patient was discharged because of clinical improvement. Two weeks later, she was brought to the emergency room with deterioration in her general condition. On thorax tomography of the patient, an area of necrotizing pneumonia with cavitation in the lower lobe of the right lung was observed. The patient was followed up in the intensive care unit for five days. After being followed up in the COVID service for five days, she was discharged because her respiratory distress, cough and C-reactive protein (CRP) was decreased. Lung cavitation due to COVID-19 pneumonia is rare, and most cases are self-limiting. Although the last rRT-PCR test of the patient is negative, the cavitary lesion in the lung can maintain contagiousness even if it is at a low level. Therefore, the extension of treatment and isolation time should be considered in such patients.

TI  - Elevated blood favipiravir levels are inversely associated with ferritin levels and induce the elevation of uric acid levels in COVID-19 treatment: A retrospective single-center study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Introduction: Measurement of blood Favipiravir (FPV) levels and accumulation of data in COVID-19 patients are critical for assessing FPV efficacy and safety. We performed a retrospective study based on measurements of blood levels of FPV and related factors in COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital. Furthermore, we also investigated the association between blood FPV levels and uric acid level alterations before and after FPV administration. Methods: We enrolled 27 COVID-19 patients who had received FPV treatment at Hokushin General Hospital from April 1 to December 31, 2020. Age, gender, COVID-19 severity, presence of comorbidities, and laboratory data for each subject were investigated to identify factors that correlate with blood FPV levels. Uric acid levels were measured before and after FPV administration and a difference between the levels (i.e., a change of uric acid level) was evaluated. Results: When a significant univariate variable was input by the stepwise method and a combination of variables that maintained statistical superiority was searched, serum ferritin was the only factor that independently affected blood FPV level. Furthermore, in the high-FPV group (20 mu g/mL or more), a significant increase in uric acid levels was observed after FPV administration. The increment value was significantly larger than that in the low-FPV group (less than 20 mu g/mL). Conclusions: Ferritin level was an important independent factor inversely affecting blood FPV level. Furthermore, a high blood FPV level induced the elevation of uric acid levels in COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - The anti-COVID-19 drug Favipiravir: Degradation, Method development, Validation, NMR/LC-MS characterization, and In-vitro safety evaluation
T2  - CHEMICAL PAPERS
AB  - It is critical to characterize the degradation products of therapeutic drugs to determine their safety as these degradation products may possess fatal effects on the human physiological system. Favipiravir (FVP), a novel anti-Covid-19 drug, that is recently used all over the world with a great impact on humanity was our target to explore more about its toxicity, the margins of its safety, and its degradants in different degradation conditions. The goal of this study is to identify, characterize, and confirm the structures of FVP oxidative and alkaline breakdown products, as well as to assess their safety utilizing in-vitro SRB cytotoxicity assay on normal human skin fibroblasts (NHSF) cell lines. After oxidative and alkaline degradation of FVP, one degradation product was produced in each condition which was isolated from FVP using flash chromatography, characterized by (HNMR)-H-1 and LC-MS/MS techniques. A reversed-phase Thermo Fischer Hypersil C-18 column (4.6 x 150 mm, 5 m) was used to achieve HPLC chromatographic separation. Acetonitrile-5 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 2.5) (50:50, v/v) was employed as the mobile phase, with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. At 332 nm, the column effluent was measured. Over the concentration range of 0.5-100 mu g/mL, the calibration curve was linear. The intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations were less than 2%, and good percentage recoveries were obtained that fulfilled the acceptance criteria of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) recommendations. The Plackett-Burman design was used to assess the robustness. Each degradant was isolated single using Flash chromatography and methylene chloride: methanol gradient mobile phase. The chemical structures of the degradation products have been confirmed and compared to the intact FVP using H-1-NMR, and Mass spectroscopy. A postulated mechanism of the degradation process has been depicted and the degradants fragmentation pattern has been portrayed. In addition, the in vitro SRB cytotoxicity assay to evaluate the safety profile of FVP and the degradation end products showed their high safety margin in both conditions with IC50 >100 mu g/ml with no signs of toxicity upon examination of the treated NHSF cells under the optical microscope

TI  - Voltammetric Determination of Favipiravir Used as an Antiviral Drug for the Treatment of Covid-19 at Pencil Graphite Electrode
T2  - ELECTROANALYSIS
AB  - This work describes the sensitive voltammetric determination of favipiravir (FAV) based on its reduction for the first time with a low-cost and disposable pencil graphite electrode (PGE). In addition, the determination of FAV was also performed based on its oxidation. Differential pulse (DP) voltammograms recorded in 0.5 M H2SO4 for the reduction of FAV show that peak currents increase linearly in the range of 1.0 to 600.0 mu M with a limit of detection of 0.35 mu M. The acceptable recovery values (98.9-106.0 %) obtained from a pharmaceutical tablet, real human urine, and artificial blood serum samples spiked with FAV confirm the high accuracy of the proposed method.

TI  - A gadolinium-based magnetic ionic liquid for supramolecular dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction followed by HPLC/UV for the determination of favipiravir in human plasma
T2  - BIOMEDICAL CHROMATOGRAPHY
AB  - Favipiravir is a potential antiviral medication that has been recently licensed for Covid-19 treatment. In this work, a gadolinium-based magnetic ionic liquid was prepared and used as an extractant in dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) of favipiravir in human plasma. The high enriching ability of DLLME allowed the determination of favipiravir in real samples using HPLC/UV with sufficient sensitivity. The effects of several variables on extraction efficiency were investigated, including type of extractant, amount of extractant, type of disperser and disperser volume. The maximum enrichment was attained using 50 mg of the Gd-magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) and 150 mu l of tetrahydrofuran. The Gd-based MIL could form a supramolecular assembly in the presence of tetrahydrofuran, which enhanced the extraction efficiency of favipiravir. The developed method was validated according to US Food and Drug Administration bioanalytical method validation guidelines. The coefficient of determination was 0.9999, for a linear concentration range of 25 to 1.0 x 10(5) ng/ml. The percentage recovery (accuracy) varied from 99.83 to 104.2%, with RSD values (precision) ranging from 4.07 to 11.84%. The total extraction time was about 12 min and the HPLC analysis time was 5 min. The method was simple, selective and sensitive for the determination of favipiravir in real human plasma.

TI  - Drug Repurposing Strategy (DRS): Emerging Approach to Identify Potential Therapeutics for Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Infection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB  - Drug repurposing is also termed as drug repositioning or therapeutic switching. This method is applied to identify the novel therapeutic agents from the existing FDA approved clinically used drug molecules. It is considered as an efficient approach to develop drug candidates with new pharmacological activities or therapeutic properties. As the drug discovery is a costly, time-consuming, laborious, and highly risk process, the novel approach of drug repositioning is employed to increases the success rate of drug development. This strategy is more advantageous over traditional drug discovery process in terms of reducing duration of drug development, low-cost, highly efficient and minimum risk of failure. In addition to this, World health organization declared Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as pandemic globally on February 11, 2020. Currently, there is an urgent need to develop suitable therapeutic agents for the prevention of the outbreak of COVID-19. So, various investigations were carried out to design novel drug molecules by utilizing different approaches of drug repurposing to identify drug substances for treatment of COVID-19, which can act as significant inhibitors against viral proteins. It has been reported that COVID-19 can infect human respiratory system by entering into the alveoli of lung via respiratory tract. So, the infection occurs due to specific interaction or binding of spike protein with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. Hence, drug repurposing strategy is utilized to identify suitable drugs by virtual screening of drug libraries. This approach helps to determine the binding interaction of drug candidates with target protein of coronavirus by using computational tools such as molecular similarity and homology modeling etc. For predicting the drug-receptor interactions and binding affinity, molecular docking study and binding free energy calculations are also performed. The methodologies involved in drug repurposing can be categorized into three groups such as drug-oriented, target-oriented and disease or therapy-oriented depending on the information available related to quality and quantity of the physico-chemical, biological, pharmacological, toxicological and pharmacokinetic property of drug molecules. This review focuses on drug repurposing strategy applied for existing drugs including Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin, Baraticinib, Tocilizumab, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Prulifloxacin, Carfilzomib, Bictegravir, Nelfinavir, Tegobuvir and Glucocorticoids etc to determine their effectiveness toward the treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Evaluation of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 based on the real-world
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTI-INFECTIVE THERAPY
AB  - Background The role of favipiravir (FVP) as a COVID-19 treatment is recognized but not fully elucidated. We aimed to evaluate whether FVP has definite clinical efficacy and safety in the treatment of COVID-19. Methods International and Chinese databases were searched for randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating FVP for the treatment of COVID-19. A meta-analysis was performed and published literature was synthesized to evaluate the corresponding therapeutic effects. Results We included 13 studies (1430 patients in total). Meta-analysis showed that patients with mild-to-moderate disease treated with FVP had a significantly higher viral clearance rate than those in the control group 10 and 14 days after initiation of treatment [RR: 1.13 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.28), P = 0.04; I-2 = 39% for day 10 and RR: 1.16 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.30), P = 0.008; I-2 = 38% for day 14] and a significantly shorter hospital stay [MD: -1.52 (95% CI: -2.82, -0.23), P = 0.02; I-2 = 0%]. Conclusions FVP significantly promotes viral clearance and reduces the hospitalization duration in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients, which can reduce the risk of severe disease outcomes in patients. However, more importantly, the results showed no benefit of FVP in severe patients, and caution should be taken regarding the treatment options of FVP in severe patients.
   PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY The urgent need to identify effective interventions to treat novel coronavirus infections is a major challenge. The role of favipiravir (FVP) as a COVID-19 treatment is recognized but not fully elucidated. Our study showed a significant correlation between viral clearance and the promotion of clinical improvement with FVP in mild-to-moderate patients, which is significant for reducing the length of hospital stay of patients, reducing the risk of patients progressing to severe disease, thereby reducing mortality. However, the results showed no benefit of FVP in severe patients and the conclusion of this study still needs to be further verified by clinical trials with large samples.

T2  - SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY
AB  - With the global epidemic of the COVID-19 virus, extensive and rapid research on drug therapy is underway around the world. In this regard, one of the most widely studied drugs is Favipiravir. Our aim in this paper is to conduct comprehensive research based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) on the potential of metallofullerenes as suitable drug carriers. The surface interaction of Favipiravir with organometallic compound resulted by doping of the five transition metals of the first row of the periodic table (Ti, Cr, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn) was examined in depth to select the most suitable metallofullerenes. First, the adsorption geometries of Favipiravir drug onto each metallofullerene were deeply investigated. It was found that Cr-, Fe-, and Ni-doped fullerenes provide the excellent adsorbent property with adsorption energies of -148.2, -149.6, and -146.6 kJ/mol, respectively. The Infrared spectroscopy (IR) study was conducted to survey the stretching vibration of bonds involving in the systems, specialty the C=O in the drug, C-M in the metallofullerene, and M-O in the metallofullerene-drug complex. Finally, the UV-vis analysis showed that the absorption spectra for the studied systems may be attributed to the transition from pi-pi* and/or n-pi*. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Strategies and Nucleoside Analogues
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - The emergence or re-emergence of viruses with epidemic and/or pandemic potential, such as Ebola, Zika, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 and 2 (SARS and SARS-CoV-2) viruses, or new strains of influenza represents significant human health threats due to the absence of available treatments. Vaccines represent a key answer to control these viruses. However, in the case of a public health emergency, vaccine development, safety, and partial efficacy concerns may hinder their prompt deployment. Thus, developing broad-spectrum antiviral molecules for a fast response is essential to face an outbreak crisis as well as for bioweapon countermeasures. So far, broad-spectrum antivirals include two main categories: the family of drugs targeting the host-cell machinery essential for virus infection and replication, and the family of drugs directly targeting viruses. Among the molecules directly targeting viruses, nucleoside analogues form an essential class of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. In this review, we will discuss the interest for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies and their limitations, with an emphasis on virus-targeted, broad-spectrum, antiviral nucleoside analogues and their mechanisms of action.

TI  - Evaluation of clinical and laboratory characteristics and factors affecting mortality in 500 hospitalized COVID-19 patients A retrospective study
T2  - SAUDI MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to Afyonkarahisar Health Sciences University, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey, and to determine the factors affecting mortality.
   Methods: A total of 500 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between 19th of March and 30th of September 2020 in Afyonkarahisar Health Sciences University, Faculty of Medicine, Pandemic Service, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey, were retrospectively investigated for this study. These individuals' prognoses, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological information were examined and recorded retrospectively. Comparisons were carried out between the characteristics of patients with a prognosis of death and those who recovered.
   Results: Of the 500 definite COVID-19 cases included in the study, 53.8% were male and the mean age was 57.6 +/- 15.1 (18-88 years). The most common comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. A total of 45 (9%) patients developed mortality. Factors such as advanced age, male gender, shortness of breath, fever at admission, comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, lymphopenia, high C-reactive protein, high D-dimer, and high ferritin in the laboratory were found to be important risk factors for mortality. Treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir were not found to have lower mortality rates than one another.
   Conclusion: Considering these elements when assessing patients and adjusting the course of treatment according to the recommendations of the most recent guidelines may lower mortality.

TI  - Solubility of favipiravir (as an anti-COVID-19) in supercritical carbon dioxide: An experimental analysis and thermodynamic modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS
AB  - Favipiravir is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 in the early stages of the disease. In this work, the solubility of favipiravir was measured in supercritical CO2 at temperatures ranging from 308 to 338 K and pressures ranging from 12 to 30 MPa. The mole fraction solubility of favipiravir was in the range of 3.0 x 10(-6) to 9.05 x 10(-4). The solubility data were correlated with three types of methods including; (a) density-based models (Chrastil, Garlapati and Madras, Sparks et al., Sodeifian et al., K-J and Keshmiri et al.), (b) Equations of states SRK with quadratic mixing rules) and (c) expanded liquid theory (modified Wilson model). According to the results, modified Wilson and K-J models are generally capable of providing good correlation of solubility. Finally, the approximate values of total (delta H-total), vaporization (delta H-vap), and solvation (delta H-sol) enthalpies were computed.

TI  - Examination of Four Antiviral Drugs by Studying Their Polynomials and Topological Indices
T2  - CHEMICAL METHODOLOGIES
AB  - A B S T R A C T To fight against viral diseases, in addition to prevent the spread of the disease, it is necessary to discover suitable antiviral agents to save as many lives as possible. Therefore, it seems important to develop new and effective vaccines. An efficient way to find effective drugs or vaccines is to answer whether they effectively treat the viral disease of interest. In this article, M-polynomial, NM-polynomial, and some topological indices are investigated for Lopinavir, Azithromycin, Favipiravir, and Oseltamivir, which are considered as the efficient COVID-19 antiviral drugs, and they can be used as a guide to discover more efficient drugs to battle against COVID-19. Also, in addition to calculate the topological indices, M-polynomial and NM-polynomial were plotted and compared as well as they were used to calculate the topological indices.

AB  - N-(1,3-Benzothiazol-2-yl)-N-(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-pyrimidine-2-yl) amine was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, NMR and X-ray single crystal diffraction. The compound structure belongs to the triclinic system with the P-1 space group with unit cell parameters a = 11.9290(4), b = 13.2547(4) and c = 15.3904(5) angstrom. Hirhsfeld surface analysis is performed to revealintermolecular interactions with these interactions. The molecular structure, vibrational spectroscopic data and HOMOs and LUMOs analyses were calculated by using the DFT/B3LYP method with the 6-311 + G(d,p)) basis set. Some of pharmacokinetic parameters and drug-likeness properties of the compound were also performed. Besides these, the present work is a searching to test N-(1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)-N-(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-pyrimidine-2-yl) amine as an inhibitor for the SARS-CoV-2. For this aim, the molecular docking analysis of the synthesized compound was applied along with Favipiravir. Besides the docking results, ADMET properties of the compound were also calculated.

TI  - ADMET and quantitative structure property relationship analysis of anti-Covid drugs against omicron variant with some degree-based topological indices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB  - Chemical graph theory is one of the important fields in mathematical chemistry which provides a useful tool called topological indices which transforms chemical structure of a molecule into a numerical value. Topological indices are used to investigate physicochemical properties, pharmaco-kinetic properties, biological activity in quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) and quantitative structure-activity relationship. The most life-threatening disease the world facing is COVID-19 and its prominent variants like alpha, beta, delta and omicron variants. The delta and omicron variants are deemed one of the most contagious strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Since there is no exact drug for these variants, but researches are been carried out with some existing and new drugs which are effective against delta and omicron variants. Favipiravir, Baricitinib, Fluvoxamine, Nirmatrelvir and Molnupiravir are some of the drugs currently used to treat COVID-19 omicron variant. In this paper QSPR model is designed to predict some selected physicochemical properties and ADMET properties of the above aforesaid drugs by using some degree-based indices such as first K Banhatti index, second K Banhatti index, first K hyper Banhatti index, second K hyper Banhatti index, modified first K Banhatti index, modified second K Banhatti index and harmonic K Banhatti index via M-Polynomial. The relationship analyses for the physicochemical and ADMET properties with the degree-based indices are done by using the quadratic and cubic regression method respectively. The results obtained can be expanded to correlate several other properties associated with drugability of potential candidates that can further be utilized to construct a disease-based library of drugs.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The novel coronavirus outbreak began in late December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide, critically impacting public health systems. A number of already approved and marketed drugs are being tested for repurposing, including Favipiravir. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42020180032). All clinical trials which addressed the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in comparison to other control groups for treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 were included. We searched electronic databases including LitCovid/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scientific Information Database up to 31 December 2020. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. All analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2, and the risk ratio index was calculated. Egger and Begg test was used for assessing publication bias. Nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant clinical improvement in the Favipiravir group versus the control group during seven days after hospitalization (RR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41; P=0.001). Viral clearance was more in 14 days after hospitalization in Favipiravir group than control group, but this finding marginally not significant (RR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25; P=0.094). Requiring supplemental oxygen therapy in the Favipiravir group was 7% less than the control group, (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.67-1.28; P=0.664). Transferred to ICU and adverse events were not statistically different between two groups. The mortality rate in the Favipiravir group was approximately 30% less than the control group, but this finding not statistically significant. Favipiravir possibly exerted no significant beneficial effect in the term of mortality in the general group of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. We should consider that perhaps the use of antiviral once the patient has symptoms is too late and this would explain their low efficacy in the clinical setting.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Favipiravir Treatment in Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia: a Single Centre Experience
T2  - KONURALP TIP DERGISI
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of favipiravir (FVP) in severe COVID-19.
   Methods: This is a retrospective study of 142 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia signs, who received inpatient treatment between March 15 and May 20, 2020. The patients were divided into two groups according to the use of FVP treatment; group 1 (n = 99) included patients who treated with FVP and group 2 (n = 43) who didn't receive FVP.
   Results: Mean age was 66.47 +/- 11.89 in group 1, and 68.58 +/- 14.78 in group 2. Forty patients (40.4%) in group 1 and 22 (51.2%) in group 2 were treated in the intensive care unit (P > 0.05). The proportion of eosinophil, tendency of increasing thrombocyte counts and eosinophil/neutrophil ratio in FVP group was significantly higher than non-FVP group (p < 0.05). In Group 1, patients had significantly reduced erythroid series, and elevated uric acid levels as side effects of FVP. With respect to complications during hospitalization, there was no significant difference among the groups for mechanical ventilator requirement, acute kidney injury, dialysis requirement and sepsis (P > 0.05). The mortality rates in Group 1 (n = 26 [26.3%]) were lower than those in group 2 (n = 16 [37.2%]), but it was not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: While the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia options were limited during the initial stages of the pandemic, the FVP may be effective in severe cases. To confirm this effect, randomized controlled studies are needed in patients of all disease severities.

TI  - Delayed onset of severe immune thrombocytopenia associated with COVID-19 pneumonia
T2  - RESPIRATORY MEDICINE CASE REPORTS
AB  - A 72-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital for treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and was started on favipiravir, heparin calcium, and methylprednisolone pulse therapy. He recovered from respiratory failure about one month later. However, he soon developed purpura in his lower limbs and thrombocytopenia, and immune thrombocytopenia was subsequently diagnosed. Although immune thrombocytopenia is one of the early complications of COVID-19, the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 is thought to be a factor in the late onset of immune thrombocytopenia. In cases of severe COVID-19 for which corticosteroids were used for treatment, autoimmune diseases such as immune thrombocytopenia may manifest themselves late in the disease course.

TI  - Use of Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall. ex Nees and risk of pneumonia in hospitalised patients with mild coronavirus disease 2019: A retrospective cohort study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundAndrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall. ex Nees (AP) has been widely used in Thailand to treat mild COVID-19 infections since early 2020; however, supporting evidence is scarce and ambiguous. Thus, this study aimed to examine whether the use of AP is associated with a decreased risk of pneumonia in hospitalised mild COVID-19 patients. Materials and methodsWe collected data between March 2020 and August 2021 from COVID-19 patients admitted to one hospital in Thailand. Patients whose infection was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, had normal chest radiography and did not receive favipiravir at admission were included and categorised as either AP (deriving from a dried and ground aerial part of the plant), given as capsules with a total daily dose of 180 mg andrographolide for 5 days or standard of care. They were followed for pneumonia confirmed by chest radiography. Multiple logistic regression was used for the analysis controlling for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, statin use, and antihypertensive drug use. ResultsA total of 605 out of 1,054 patients (mostly unvaccinated) were included in the analysis. Of these, 59 patients (9.8%) developed pneumonia during the median follow-up of 7 days. The incidence rates of pneumonia were 13.93 (95% CI 10.09, 19.23) and 12.47 (95% CI 8.21, 18.94) per 1,000 person-days in the AP and standard of care groups, respectively. Compared to the standard of care group, the odds ratios of having pneumonia in the AP group were 1.24 (95% CI 0.71, 2.16; unadjusted model) and 1.42 (95% CI 0.79, 2.55; fully adjusted model). All sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main results. ConclusionThe use of AP was not significantly associated with a decreased risk of pneumonia in mild COVID-19 patients. While waiting for insights from ongoing trials, AP's use in COVID-19 should be done with caution.

TI  - Double chelation of Iron through dimer formation of favipiravir: Density functional theory analysis
T2  - MAIN GROUP CHEMISTRY
AB  - This work was performed to examine an idea about full chelation of Iron (Fe) by well-known favipiravir (Fav) as a possible mechanism of action for medication of COVID-19 patients. To this aim, formations of Fe- mediated dimers of Fav were investigated by performing density functional theory (DFT) computations of electronic and structural features for singular and dimer models. The results indicated that the models of dimers were suitable for formation, in which two cis (D1) and trans (D2) models were obtained regarding the configurations of two Fav counterparts towards each other. Energy results indicated that formation of D1 was slightly more favorable than formation of D2. Molecular orbital features affirmed hypothesized interacting sites of Fav for Fe-mediated dimers formations, in which atomic charges and other molecular orbital related representations affirmed such achievements. Moreover, detection of such dimer formation was also possible by monitoring variations of molecular orbitals features. As a consequence, formations of Fe-mediated dimers of Fav could be achievable for possible removal of excess of Fe as a proposed mechanism of action for Fav in medication of COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Quantum design of transition metals decorated on boron phosphide inorganic nanocluster for Favipiravir adsorption: a possible treatment for COVID-19
T2  - NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB  - With the global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus, vast and widespread research on drug therapy is in progress around the world. In this respect, one of the most widely studied drugs is Favipiravir. Our aim in this work was to study the adsorption behavior of Favipiravir drug on the surface of first-row transition metals (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) decorated on boron phosphide (B12P12) nanocage to develop an excellent drug carrier through the density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT). The interaction of the drug with different transition metals decorated B12P12 nanodusters was studied in order to examine the most suitable nanocage for the drug carrier. A narrow band gap with red-shifting in absorption spectrum was observed for the drug-adsorbed metal-decorated B12P12 nanodusters. Excellent adsorption energies were found in Favipiravir-adsorbed metal-decorated nanodusters (E-ad = 151 to 212 kJ mol(-1)). Negative values of Gibbs free energy and enthalpy of the reaction suggested that the adsorption of the drug on metal-decorated B12P12 nanodusters is an exothermic and spontaneous phenomenon. Different geometrical parameters such as molecular electrostatic potential, the alignment of frontier molecular orbitals, Q(NBO), dipole moment, and global indices of reactivity are considered for drug adsorption. Results of different analyses indicated that metal decoration on B12P12 nanodusters is an efficient approach for Favipiravir adsorption. Thus, these systems may facilitate us in the future for COVID-19 therapy.

TI  - Treatment and outcome of COVID-19 patients in a specialized hospital during the third wave: advance of age and increased mortality compared with the first/second waves
T2  - JA CLINICAL REPORTS
AB  - Purpose To elucidate the clinical course of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treated at a specialized hospital mainly for those with mild and moderate severity during the third wave, and to compare that with the first and second (1st/2nd) waves. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the severity on admission, treatment, and outcome of a total of 581 patients from September, 2020, to March, 2021, and examined the risk factors for deterioration of respiratory condition, defined as requiring oxygen >= 7 L/min for 12 h. Results The median age was 78 (interquartile range 62-83) years, older than in the 1st/2nd waves (53 years), and 50% of the patients was male. The number of patients classified as mild (peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) >= 96%), moderate I, II, and severe (requiring admission to the ICU or mechanical ventilation) was 121, 324, 132, and 4, respectively. Favipiravir, ciclesonide, dexamethasone, and/or heparin were administered for treatment. Respiratory condition recovered in 496 (85%) patients. It worsened in 81 patients (14%); 51 (9%) of whom were transferred to tertiary hospitals and 30 (5%) died. Mortality rate increased by fivefold compared during the 1st/2nd waves. Age, male sex, increased body mass index, and C-reactive protein (CRP) on admission were responsible for worsening of the respiratory condition. Conclusion Patients were older in the third wave compared with the 1st/2nd waves. Respiratory condition recovered in 85%; whereas 5% of the patients died. Old age, male sex, increased body mass index, and CRP would be responsible for worsening of the respiratory condition.

TI  - The supramolecularly complexes of calix[4]arene derivatives toward favipiravir antiviral drug (used to treatment of COVID-19): a DFT study on the geometry optimization, electronic structure and infrared spectroscopy of adsorption and sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF INCLUSION PHENOMENA AND MACROCYCLIC CHEMISTRY
AB  - While the world is in search of a vaccine that can cure COVID-19 disease, favipiravir is the most commonly used antiviral drug in the treatment of patients during the pandemic process. In this study, we investigated the host-guest interaction between the popular supramolecule calix[4]arene derivatives and the favipiravir drug by using the DFT (Density Functional Theory) method. The B3LYP hybrid method and 6-31G (d,p) basis set were utilized to determine the optimized structures of the host and guest molecules and their complexes. The negative adsorption energy ( increment E) and adsorption enthalpy ( increment H) calculated for the complexes formed between calix[4]arene compounds and favipiravir drug molecule mentioned that adsorption of favipiravir molecule was an exothermic process on calix[4]arene structures. On the other hand, among the calixarene derivatives in the study, Gibbs free energy change ( increment G) value for the adsorption was only negative on calix[4]arene4 molecule. The infrared spectroscopy (IR) calculations were performed by examining the C=O, O-H and NH2 vibrational frequencies to see the adsorption behavior in the favipiravir-calix[4]arene complex. After adsorption of the favipiravir molecule, HOMO-LUMO gap values decreased significantly for the structures and therefore electrical conductivity increased proportionally. In addition, sensor response factors, Fermi energy levels and workfunction changes of calix[4]arene derivatives were calculated and examined. Charge transfer between the four calix[4]arene compounds and the favipiravir molecule has occurred after adsorption. This attributes that calix[4]arene derivatives can be used as a well-suited favipiravir sensor (electronic and workfunction) and adsorbent at room temperature. Based on the calculations made to see the solvent effect on the adsorption of favipiravir it was determined that it did not affect the interaction between the drug molecule and the calix[4]arene compound too much and the adsorption energy turned into a slightly less negative value.

TI  - Pyrazolone-type compounds: synthesis and in silico assessment of antiviral potential against key viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2
T2  - RSC ADVANCES
AB  - Coronavirus outbreak is still a major public health concern. The high mutation ability of SARS-CoV-2 periodically delivers more transmissible and dangerous variants. Hence, the necessity for an efficient and inexpensive antiviral agent is urgent. In this work, pyrazolone-type compounds were synthesised, characterised using spectroscopic methods and theoretical tools, and evaluated in silico against proteins of SARS-CoV-2 responsible for host cell entry and reproduction processes, i.e., spike protein (S), M-pro, and PLpro. Five of twenty compounds are newly synthesised. In addition, the crystal structure of a pyrazolone derivative bearing a vanillin moiety is determined. The obtained in silico results indicate a more favourable binding affinity of pyrazolone analogues towards M-pro, and PLpro in comparison to drugs lopinavir, remdesivir, chloroquine, and favipiravir, while in the case of S protein only lopinavir exerted higher binding affinity. Also, the investigations were performed on ACE2 and the spike RBD-ACE2 complex. The obtained results for these proteins suggest that selected compounds could express antiviral properties by blocking the binding to the host cell and viral spreading, also. Moreover, several derivatives expressed multitarget antiviral action, blocking both binding and reproduction processes. Additionally, in silico ADME/T calculations predicted favourable features of the synthesised compounds, i.e., drug-likeness, oral bioavailability, as well as good pharmacokinetic parameters related to absorption, metabolism, and toxicity. The obtained results imply the great potential of synthesised pyrazolones as multitarget agents against SARS-CoV-2 and represent a valuable background for further in vitro investigations.

TI  - Heart transplant recipient survivor from COVID-19: The first case of Turkey
T2  - TURK GOGUS KALP DAMAR CERRAHISI DERGISI-TURKISH JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Any highly infectious and rapidly spreading disease is a primary concern for immunocompromised solid organ transplant recipients. The number of data about the spectrum of clinical illness, the treatment modalities, and the outcomes of COVID-19 in this vulnerable population is scant and still remains empirical. Herein, we report the first COVID-19 case of a heart transplant recipient in Turkey who presented with fever, postnasal discharge, and myalgias for two days. The possibility of lung involvement was ruled out by thoracic computed tomography. Despite stable vital signs, we reduced the intensity of immunosuppressive therapy and maintained home self-isolation promptly. We also commenced a five-day course of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg q12h initially. After confirmation of real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerasechain-reaction testing of the nasopharyngeal swab positive for COVID-19, the patient was hospitalized. After a loading dose of favipiravir 1,600 mg b.i. d., the patient received a five-day course of favipiravir 600 mg q12h. He was discharged with cure after 23 days of hospital isolation and treatment. In conclusion, treatment process can be affected by the daily electrocardiography, hand-held portable echocardiography, myocardial injury markers, and pulse oximeter for self-monitoring in the follow-up of previous heart transplant recipients suffering from COVID-19. The lack of treatment protocols in the solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection and the controversies about the protective effect of immunosuppression invite a global and update discussion.

TI  - COVID-19 Infection in Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Single Center Experience
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
AB  - Background. Kidney transplant recipients appear to be particularly high risk for critical COVID-19 illness owing to chronic immunosuppression and coexisting conditions. The aim of this study is to present the clinical characteristics and outcomes of our hospital's kidney transplant recipients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection.
   Methods. In our retrospective observational study of COVID-19 PCR-positive patients, 31 of them were hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia and they were evaluated using demographics, laboratory data, treatment, and outcome. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI), which is calculated using the serum albumin concentration and total lymphocytic count, was also evaluated. The baseline immunosuppressive therapy of patients at the time of admission and the treatments they received during their hospitalization were recorded. All patients were treated with favipiravir.
   Results. Of the 31 renal transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 20 were male and the mean age was 52.7 +/- 13.4. Nine (29%) of the patients died. All patients were treated with favipiravir for 5 days; laboratory tests were recorded before and after treatment. The mean PNI of the patients who survived was higher than the patients who died.
   Conclusions. The 9 patients who died had lower PNI and higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), creatinine, 1-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 have higher rates of mortality. The PNI exhibited good predictive performance and may be a useful clinical marker that can be used for estimating survival in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Comparison of biventricular myocardial strain according to treatment regimens in patients discharged after COVID-19 recovery
T2  - CUKUROVA MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose: The effects of different COVID-19 therapeutic strategies on cardiac function are uncertain. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different medical treatments on biventricular function in patients who had recovered from COVID-19.
   Materials and Methods: Speckle-tracking echocardiography was performed to examine the biventricular myocardial function of patients at follow-up visits after recovery from COVID-19. The patients were divided into two groups based on the medication they used during the active disease: favipiravir (FAV; n = 60) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ; n = 60). A comparison was made with risk factor-matched controls (n = 41).
   Results: A total of 161 patients were included in the study. The left ventricular end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, end-diastolic diameter, and end-systolic diameter were higher in the HCQ and FAV groups compared to the controls, while the left ventricular ejection fraction was similar between all the groups. The right ventricular diameter was increased, and the systolic pulmonary artery pressure was higher in the HCQ and FAV groups compared to the controls. The left ventricular global longitudinal strain (-18 +/- 6.6 vs. -19.7 +/- 4.4 vs. -20.4 +/- 5, respectively), the right ventricular global longitudinal strain (-19.8 +/- 7.5 vs. -22.2 +/- 6 vs. -23.4 +/- 6.2, respectively), and the right ventricular free wall strain (-16.9 +/- 3.6 vs. -18.2 +/- 2.4 vs. -19.6 +/- 4.7, respectively) were worse in the HCQ group compared to the FAV and control groups.
   Conclusion: This study found echocardiographic evidence of subclinical cardiac involvement in both the HCQ and FAV groups compared to the controls. However, HCQ treatment was associated with an increased risk of biventricular subclinical systolic dysfunction in COVID-19 survivors compared with FAV treatment.

TI  - Computational Study of the Correlation of in-vitro Antiviral Activities Against SARS-CoV-2 with Different Theoretical Descriptors
T2  - PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB  - The electrostatic potential (V(r)), the average local ionization energy (I(r)), the relative hardness (eta(rel)), the electron affinity (EA), the ionization potential (IP), the electronegativity (chi), the hardness (eta) and the electrophilicity (omega) were tested as theoretical descriptors of the reported in-vitro antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 for seven different compounds with the same set of controlled variables: chloroquine, favipiravir, nafamostat, nitazoxanide, penciclovir, remdesivir, rivabirin, in order to obtain information about the electronic nature of the hosting sites in the virus. Results indicate that the hardness of the studied drugs correlates moderately well with the biological activity, which gives some insights to infer in terms of the HSAB principle of Pearson, that the electrostatic interactions must predominate in the virus hosting sites and that these areas have low polarizability. When a multiple correlation analysis is performed, the correlation improves when the conceptual hardness (eta), V-min, and the molecular volume are considered, which suggests that the interaction of the molecules with the preferred hard hosting sites should be negatively affected by the volume of the selected drug and that V-min contributes to the correlation.

TI  - Effects of Drugs Formerly Suggested for COVID-19 Repurposing on Pannexin1 Channels
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Although many efforts have been made to elucidate the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully uncovered. However, it is known that a dysfunctional immune response and the accompanying uncontrollable inflammation lead to troublesome outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Pannexin1 channels are put forward as interesting drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19 due to their key role in inflammation and their link to other viral infections. In the present study, we selected a panel of drugs previously tested in clinical trials as potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 early on in the pandemic, including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, dexamethasone, ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, and ritonavir. The effect of the drugs on pannexin1 channels was assessed at a functional level by means of measurement of extracellular ATP release. Immunoblot analysis and real-time quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to study the potential of the drugs to alter pannexin1 protein and mRNA expression levels, respectively. Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and the combination of lopinavir with ritonavir were found to inhibit pannexin1 channel activity without affecting pannexin1 protein or mRNA levels. Thusthree new inhibitors of pannexin1 channels were identified that, though currently not being used anymore for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, could be potential drug candidates for other pannexin1-related diseases.

TI  - Interactions between favipiravir and a BNC cage towards drug delivery applications
T2  - STRUCTURAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Electronic structure analysis of bimolecular formation of favipiravir (Fav) and a representative model of boron-nitrogen-carbon (BNC) cage was performed in this work for providing more insightful information regarding the drug delivery purposes by the importance of Fav drug for medication of COVID-19. To achieve the purpose of this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to obtain the stabilized structures and corresponding molecular and atomic scale descriptors. Six models of BNC-Fav complexes were obtained reading the participation of different atomic positions of Fav to interactions with the BNC cage surface. The results yielded BNC-Fav2 at the highest strength and BNC-Fav4 at the lowest strength of bimolecular formations. Molecular orbital-related features and atomic scale quadrupole coping constants all revealed that BNC-Fav2 complex could be proposed for employing in drug delivery process by managing the loaded Fav contribution to future interactions.

TI  - DFT Examination of Electronic and Structural Features of Favipiravir for Iron Chelation
T2  - BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH IN APPLIED CHEMISTRY
AB  - Density functional theory calculations were performed to examine electronic and structural features of favipiravir (Fav) for iron (Fe) chelation. Fav was well known for the possible medication of COVID-19; however, its mechanism of action has still been a challenging issue. Therefore, this work was done to provide information regarding the possible action of Fav for participating in the Fe chelation process. To this aim, various types of molecular and atomic descriptors were obtained to discuss the topic of this work. Obtained values of energies indicated different levels of stability for pure Fav compounds, in which such variations were also found for FavFe complexes. Molecular orbital-related features showed a different tendency to contribute to reactions for both pure and complex Fav models, in which changes of the energy levels of molecular orbitals raise the detection function of Fe for Fav compounds. Atomic-scale features also indicated direct and indirect roles of atomic sites for formations of FavFe complex models. As a consequence, the idea of Fe chelation by Fav compound was affirmed regarding the obtained results with providing detailed information for investigating the mechanism of action of Fav in treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Rapid and ecofriendly UPLC quantification of Remdesivir, Favipiravir and Dexamethasone for accurate therapeutic drug monitoring in Covid-19 Patient's plasma
T2  - MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Innovative therapeutic protocols to the rapidly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID19) epidemic is highly required all across the world. As demonstrated by clinical studies, Favipiravir (FVP) and Remdesivir (REM) are new antiviral medicines that are effective against COVID-19. REM is the first FDA approved antiviral medicine against COVID-19. In addition to antivirals, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (DEX), and anticoagulants such as apixaban (PX) are used in multidrug combinations protocols. This work develops and validates simple and selective screening of the four medicines of COVID-19 therapeutic protocol. FVP, REM, DEX, and PX as internal standard in human plasma using UPLC method by C18 column and methanol, acetonitrile, and water acidified by orthophosphate (pH = 4) in a ratio of (15: 35: 50, by volume) as an eluate flowing at 0.3 mL/min. The eluent was detected at 240 nm. The method was linear over (0.1-10 mu g/mL) for each of FVP, REM, and DEX. The validation of the UPLC method was assessed in accordance with FDA guidelines. The method can detect as low as down to 0.1 mu g/mL for all. The recoveries of the drugs in spiked human plasma ranged from 97.67 to 102.98 percent. Method accuracy and precision were assessed and the drugs showed good stability. The method was proven to be green to the environment after greenness checking by greenness profile and Eco-Scale tool.

TI  - Efficient electrochemical oxidation of COVID-19 treatment drugs favipiravir by a novel flow-through Ti/TiO2-NTA/Ti4O7 anode
T2  - ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB  - In this study, TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2-NTA) were used as an intermediate layer to provide effective electrocatalytic activity and stability for Ti/TiO2-NTA/Ti4O7 anode. Compared with Ti/Ti4O7 anode, Ti/TiO2-NTA/ Ti4O7 anode exhibited higher oxygen evolution potential (2.40 V), larger active specific surface areas (1.81 m(2) g(-1)), stronger radical generation capacity (64.42 mu M), longer accelerated service life (56.0 h), and superior favipiravir removal ratio. The flow-through electrochemical reaction system was constructed by using the porous Ti/TiO2-NTA/Ti4O7 anode. The removal ratio, TOC removal ratio and mineralization current efficiency of favipiravir in the flow-by electrochemical system were significantly improved and the energy consumption was reduced compared with the conventional flow-by electrochemical system, verifying the superiority of the porous flow-through Ti/TiO2-NTA/Ti4O7 anode. The effects of operating parameters on the removal of favipiravir in the flow-through electrochemical reaction system were investigated. The degradation mechanisms of favipiravir are the synergetic effects of the free radical (.OH and SO4 center dot-) and the direct electron transfer. Ti/TiO2-NTA/Ti4O7 anode displayed excellent stability in five consecutive cycles, exhibited significant removal ratio (87.7%) of favipiravir from actual wastewater, and remained efficient and versatile for a wide range of typical PPCPs pollutants. Therefore, Ti/TiO2-NTA/Ti4O7 is a promising porous anode material in the engineering application.

TI  - A rare complication of COVID-19: Pneumomediastinum
T2  - ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND ANALYTICAL MEDICINE
AB  - COVID-19 is still common and we do not know enough about its complications. The presence of air in the mediastinum is called pneumomediastinum. Since spontaneous pneumomediastinum is rare, pneumomediastinum is started to be reported in Covid-19 patients.
   A 26-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with fever, shortness of breath and sore throat, and was found to have COVID-19 as a result of examinations. The treatment of the patient was started, and on the 6th day of the treatment, it was observed that the patient had an increase in shortness of breath and a new cough. Free air was seen in the mediastinum on the imaging. The patient who was diagnosed with pneumomediastinum was discharged with antibiotherapy and favipiravir treatment. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a rare complication of COVID-19 infection. Here, we present a case of COVID-19 developing pneumomediastinum 6 days after the symptoms started.

TI  - The factors affecting the prolonged PCR positivity in COVID-19 patients
T2  - BRATISLAVA MEDICAL JOURNAL-BRATISLAVSKE LEKARSKE LISTY
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of factors such as age, gender, comorbid diseases and treatments applied on the positive duration of the PCR test in COVID-19 patients. Background: The duration of PCR positivity in COVID-19 patients varies. Studies in the literature investigating factors that may affect this duration are limited. METHODS: Between March and September 2020, individuals with two or more positive PCR results with a 14-day interval were included in the case group, and those whose PCR results turned negative within 14 days were included in the control group. The relationship between age, gender, contact environment, presence of additional disease, drugs used, smoking and alcohol consumption; type, duration and severity of COVID-19 symptoms, treatment applied for COVID-19 and duration of PCR positivity were examined. RESULTS: Among 126 participants the mean duration of PCR positivity was 23.38 days (min 6, max 52). Symptoms lasted 15-30 days in 41 patients (32.5 %) and 5-10 days in 30 patients (23.8 %). The positivity duration varied according to age, smoking and alcohol consumption status, and body mass index. Patients with chronic disease, and who had loss of taste and smell during the disease had a longer positive stay. This period was shorter in favipiravir users. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 infection, there are several factors that affect the PCR test to remain positive. Early-term favipiravir use may shorten this period as a modifi able factor (Tab. 3, Ref. 14).

TI  - Investigating Side Effects of Existing Drugs Used in Covid-19 Treatment
T2  - 2020 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM)
CP  - IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)
AB  - Following the rapid spread and evolution of the novel Corona virus starting in December 2019, the lack of a vaccine or a medication that proved to be effective for Covid-19 was addressed as a major concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [1]. Accordingly, physicians from countries like China and Korea rushed to provide some potential treatment for Covid-19 from their experience in treating patients of the novel Coronavirus - they used antiviral medications like lopinavir, ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin, interferon, remdesivir, sofosbuvir, nitazoxanide, favipiravir, ivermectin, etc. [1]-[3]. These drugs showed improvement in conditions of Covid-19 patients when used individually, or sometimes using a combination of multiple of them. This does not mean that any combinations of these drugs could be beneficial. Some combinations can be lethal and may lead to increasing health risks or mortality. The drugs are being used in vitro (i.e., on cells in a laboratory for experiments) and vivo (i.e., on humans or animals as clinical trials). In vitro analysis, the chemical structure of the drug and the disease are analyzed to generate a hypothesis on the performance of the drug, then the hypothesis is tested in vivo to measure the actual performance of the drug on a living creature. Although these drugs showed promising results with proper dosage, overdose and incorrect combination with other drugs sometimes proved to be lethal. The effectiveness and side-effects of some of these drugs as reported by recent researchers and trials are described in this paper. We address some related research questions concerning the side effects of the covered drugs and their interaction with other drugs based on some well tested results extracted from approved websites of drug-drug interactions. The findings are interesting and confirmed favipiravir as the most effective and safe compared to the others, and this coincides with and supports the announcement by Turkish Ministry of Health where favipiravir has been used in treating COVID-19 patients since the early days.

TI  - Ischemic Colitis induced by COVID-19: A Case Report
T2  - ANNALS OF KING EDWARD MEDICAL UNIVERSITY LAHORE PAKISTAN
AB  - COVID-19 has been associated with coagulation disorders which add further to the morbidity and mortality caused by the disease itself. Ischemic colitis can result from hypercoagulable states. In this report we present a rare case of ischemic colitis induced by COVID-19 in 27-year-old male. Patient presented with severe generalized abdominal pain. CT abdomen showed filling defects, absent enhancement indicating venous bowel ischemia. CT-angiograph revealed complete thrombosis of portal, splenic, superior and inferior mesenteric veins. Patient was shifted to intensive care unit and kept nothing per orum. He was given Heparin, tramadol and paracetamol intravenously. COVID-19 Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was positive. He was then given Favipiravir through nasogastric (NG) tube. On 4th day NG was removed and patient was subsequently discharged on 9th day. COVID-19 may lead to hypercoagulable states and gastrointestinal complications. COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms should be evaluated carefully for possible ischemia.

TI  - Suspected cholestatic liver injury induced by favipiravir in a patient with COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Favipiravir is an antiviral drug that is expected to have a therapeutic effect on SARS-CoV2 infection. Teratogenicity and hyperuricemia are known as the main side effects of favipiravir, but little is known about other side effects. This report describes a case of cholestatic liver injury induced by favipiravir. A 73-year-old Japanese with a history of alcoholic hepatitis was infected with SARS-CoV2. Drug therapy was instituted with lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta-1b. However, his condition worsened despite additional support with continuous hemodiafiltration and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We suspected complications of bacterial pneumonia and started favipiravir in addition to antimicrobial therapy. Favipiravir was administered at 6000 mg/day on the first day and 2400 mg/day for the second and subsequent days for 14 days. After the initiation of antibiotics, transaminase and total bilirubin were elevated, suggesting a transient cholestasic liver dysfunction. The liver dysfunction in this case may have been triggered by antibacterial treatment, and high dose of favipiravir may have promoted the deterioration of liver function. Monitoring of liver function is vital and close attention should be paid when using favipiravir at high doses or in patients with impaired liver function.

TI  - Favipiravir in Kidney Transplant Recipients With COVID-19: A Romanian Case Series
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
AB  - Background. Favipiravir (FPV) is an orally administrable antiviral drug that selectively inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and has been repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. There is limited information on the use of FPV in kidney transplant recipients (KTx), who often have multiple comorbidities and run a higher risk for death from COVID-19.
   Methods. We retrospectively reviewed all KTx at our institution who got sick with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021, and who received FPV (loading dose of 1800 mg x 2 on day 1, maintenance dose 2 x 800 mg/d for 5-14 days) as part of their COVID treatment. We analyzed demographics, clinical course, laboratory data, management, and outcome.
   Results. Nine KTx with COVID-19 received FPV; all were hospitalized. The median age was 52 years (range, 32-60 years), and women were predominant (77.7%). Eight KTx had pulmonary involvement on chest radiograph. On admission 1 patient had mild, 5 had moderate, 2 had severe, and 1 had critical disease. Leukopenia and increased creatinine were universally noted. Three patients had disease progression under treatment. Seven patients (77.7%) required additional oxygen, and 4 (57.1%) needed intensive care unit admission. Three KTx died, resulting in an overall mortality of 33.3%. Survivors did not show increased transaminases or creatinine during or after FPV treatment; leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets improved on discharge compared with admission values.
   Conclusions. FPV appears well tolerated by KTx with COVID-19, but its clinical benefit remains unclear. Larger analyses are needed.

TI  - Evaluation of Corrected QT Intervals of 74 COVID-19 Patients Treated with Hydroxychloroquine in Combination with or without Azithromycin and/or Favipiravir
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Objective: We aimed to evaluate the degree of QTc prolongation and associated factors in patients with COVID-19 in association with their usage of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without the combination of azithromycin (AZ) and/or favipiravir (FAV).
   Methods: This single-center, retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary care university hospital. We retrospectively examined the pre- and post-treatment electrocardiogram (ECG) records of 74 patients.
   Results: The median age was 44 (interquartile range [IQR] 27), and 34 (45.5%) of them were women. All these 74 patients were treated with HCQ. Sixty-three of them (83.2%) were treated with AZ, and eight patients (10.8%) also were treated with plus favipiravir. All ECGs were in sinus rhythm, and arrhythmia was not developed in any patients. The median (IQR) baseline QTc of 74 patients was 400 (375-421) milliseconds, the median (IQR) post-treatment QTc was 418 milliseconds (391-432), and the change was statistically significant (P<.001). There was no statistically significant difference in QTc prolongation between treatment groups. In the linear regression model, moderate disease activity, higher Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) score (>= 2), and heart rate were independent predictors. QTc prolongation of more than 60 milliseconds was observed in five patients (6.7%). Post-treatment QTc value of over 500 milliseconds was observed in three patients (4%), and the drugs were discontinued.
   Conclusions: This is the first study that demonstrates that MEWS score and disease severity are related to higher QTc prolongation values. HCQ, AZ, and FAV should be safely used in patients with lower MEWS score and without the severe disease, in conjunction with QTc follow-up.

TI  - The safety profile of favipiravir in COVID-19 patients with severe renal impairment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Objective The safety profile of favipiravir in patients with severe renal impairment has not been investigated and available data are insufficient. The study aimed to compare the incidence of favipiravir-associated adverse events amongst patients with varying renal function statuses. Methods Records of 921 patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and had received at least 5 days of favipiravir treatment were retrospectively evaluated and 228 patients were included in the study. Patients' age, sex, comorbidities, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and haematological and biochemical values were recorded. The incidence of adverse events was compared with the age, sex, comorbidities and eGFR of the patients. Results The mean age of the patients was 59.3 +/- 15.6 years, and 38.2% of the patients were women. One hundred and thirty-one (57.5%) patients had experienced adverse events. These adverse effects consisted of ALT elevation (35.5%), AST elevation (21.5%), anaemia (16.2%), hyperuricaemia (10.5%), hepatocellular injury (9.2%), neutropenia (3.5%) and thrombocytopenia (2.6%). The incidence of adverse events was not significantly different when patients had eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or eGFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (P > .05), but significantly increased when the eGFR dropped to <30 (P < .05). The differences seen with hyperuricaemia and anaemia were significant (P < .05). Conclusion Even though favipiravir appeared to be well tolerated in the individuals with renal failure in this study, its use in this population remains a challenge that requires more research and analysis.

TI  - Evaluation of the frequency and intensity of favipiravir-associated yellow-green fluorescence in lunulae, hair, and face
T2  - JOURNAL OF COSMETIC DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Background We detected yellow-green fluorescence in the face, hair and lunulae of patients using favipiravir.
   Aim We evaluated the frequency and intensity of favipiravir-associated fluorescence.
   Patients/Methods.
   The participants comprised patients who had taken at least a single dose of favipiravir and been examined no later than 30 days after the last dose. The gender, age, body mass index (BMI), Fitzpatrick's skin-type, hair color, N-acetylcysteine use, presence and the intensity of fluorescent reflection under Wood's light in the lunulae of the fingernails, hair, and the face were recorded.
   Results There were 275 patients, 144 (52.4%) of whom were women. 165 (57.9%) had used treatment for a maximum of 5 days, 99 (34.7%) for 6-10 days, and 21 (7.4%) for more than ten days. Using more than 22 tablets of favipiravir increased the probability of detecting fluorescence in the lunulae by 6.72 (2.61-17.23) times. Using more than 28 tablets increased the risk of fluorescence in hair and the T-zone by 5.92 (2.43-14.71) and 2.88 (1.11-7.47) times, respectively. No relationship was found between the fluorescence intensity in any localization and the total dose. However, we determined a negative correlation between the elapsed time after the last dose and the fluorescence intensity in the lunulae and the T-zone (p=0.036; p=0.031; respectively). It was noted that BMI negatively correlated with the fluorescence intensity in the lunulae (p=0.001). Skin type was related to intensity for all localizations (p<0.001). Fluorescence was found in the lunulae with significantly less frequency in patients using N-acetylcysteine (p=0.040).
   Conclusions We must be aware of favipiravir-induced phototoxicity.

TI  - Intriguing Antiviral Modified Nucleosides: A Retrospective View into the Future Treatment of COVID-19
T2  - ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB  - Great pioneers of nucleic acid chemistry had elucidated nucleic acid functions and structures and developed various antiviral modified nucleoside drugs. It is possible in theory that antiviral modified nucleosides prevent viral replication by inhibiting viral polymerases. However, biological phenomena far exceed our predictions at times. We describe the characteristics of the approved antiviral modified nucleosides from an organic chemistry perspective. Also, based on our experiences and findings through the development of the HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase inhibitor "Islatravir", we provide the practical and approximate guidelines for the drug development of antiviral modified nucleosides against COVID-19.

TI  - Structural insight into the binding interactions of NTPs and nucleotide analogues to RNA dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) from positive-stranded RNA viruses has always been a hot target for designing of new drugs. Major class of drugs that are targeted against RdRP are nucleotide analogues. Extensive docking and molecular dynamics study describing the binding of natural nucleotides (NTPs) and its analogues leading to significant structural variation in the RdRP has been presented here. RdRP simulations in its apo, NTP-bound, and analogue-bound form have been performed. Nucleotide analogues included in this study were, favipiravir, galidesivir, lamivudine, ribavirin, remdesivir and sofosbuvir. The conformational flexibility of the RdRP molecule has been explored using principal component (PCA) and Markov state modeling (MSM) analysis. PCA inferred the presence of correlated motions among the conserved motifs of RdRP. Inter-domain distances between the finger and thumb subdomain flanking the nascent RNA template entry site sampled open and closed conformations. The ligand and template binding motifs F and G showed negatively correlated motions. K551, R553, and R555, a part of motif F appear to form strong interactions with the ligand molecules. R836, a primer binding residue was observed to strongly bind to the analogues. MSM analysis helped to extract statistically distinct conformations explored by the RdRP. Ensemble docking of the ligands on the Markov states also suggested the involvement of the above residues in ligand interactions. Markov states obtained clearly demarcated the open/closed conformations of the template entry site. These observations on residues from the conserved motifs involved in binding to the ligands may provide an insight into designing new inhibitors.

TI  - Metal oxide nanocage as drug delivery systems for Favipiravir, as an effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19: a computational study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING
AB  - This paper is a summary of research that looks at the potential of fullerene-like (MO)(12) nanoclusters (NCs) in drug-carrying systems using density functional theory. Favipiravir/Zn12O12 (- 34.80 kcal/mol), Favipiravir/Mg12O12 (- 34.98 kcal/mol), and Favipiravir/Be12O12 (- 30.22 kcal/mol) were rated in order of drug adsorption degrees. As a result, Favipiravir attachment to (MgO)(12) and (ZnO)(12) might be simple, increasing Favipiravir loading efficiency. In addition, the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) assessment was utilized to look at the interactions between molecules. The FMO, ESP, NBO, and E-ads reactivity patterns were shown to be in excellent agreement with the QTAIM data. The electrostatic properties of the system with the biggest positive charge on the M atom and the largest E-ads were shown to be the best. This system was shown to be the best attraction site for nucleophilic agents. The findings show that (MgO)(12) and (ZnO)(12) have great carrier potential and may be used in medication delivery.

TI  - The knowledge of COVID-19 treatments, behaviors, and attitudes of providing the information on COVID-19 treatments: Perspectives of pharmacy students
T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH PROMOTION
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing community awareness about the transmission and treatment of COVID-19 will stop the spread of the virus. Pharmacy students are the potential facilitator to give community education about COVID-19 treatment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacy students' knowledge of COVID-19 treatment, behavior, and attitude of providing the information about COVID-19 treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional study, recruiting 429 pharmacy students from three schools of pharmacy in Indonesia. The questionnaire about the knowledge of COVID-19 treatment, behavior, and attitude of providing the information on COVID-19 treatment met the validity and reliability criteria. We defined the proportion of knowledge, behavior, and attitude of the students using SPSS (R) version 22. RESULTS: Most of the students are in the earlier years (46.63%), female (84.15%), find the information about COVID-19 from many sources of media (85.08%) including scientific articles and know information about COVID-19 transmission around their life area (76.46%). The students' knowledge about antiviral and plasma convalescent is good (>70%), the positive behaviors are related to the COVID-19 treatment information regarding to the antiviral and the provision of Vitamin C (>50%), and the positive attitude are related to giving information about the use of avigan (R), plasma convalescent, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and immunomodulator (>50%). CONCLUSIONS: As a future pharmacist, the knowledge of pharmacy students about COVID-19 treatment needs to be improved since earlier years. Furthermore, using the good knowledge about COVID-19 treatment, the positive behavior and attitude of providing information of the students, the community behavior and attitude will be improved. The high year students have a tendency for the good knowledge and positive behavior and attitude of providing the information.

TI  - Drug-induced liver injury in COVID-19 treatment: Incidence, mechanisms and clinical management
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak triggered a serious and potentially lethal pandemic, resulting in massive health and economic losses worldwide. The most common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients are pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a variety of complications. Multiple organ failure and damage, ultimately leading to patient death, are possible as a result of medication combinations, and this is exemplified by DILI. We hope to summarize DILI caused by the antiviral drugs favipiravir, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients in this review. The incidence of liver injury in the treatment of COVID-19 patients was searched on PubMed to investigate DILI cases. The cumulative prevalence of acute liver injury was 23.7% (16.1%-33.1%). We discuss the frequency of these events, potential mechanisms, and new insights into surveillance strategies. Furthermore, we also describe medication recommendations aimed at preserving DILI caused by treatment in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Viroinformatics approach to explore the inhibitory mechanism of existing drugs repurposed to fight against COVID-19
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The rapid breakout of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared pandemic with serious global concern due to high morbidity and mortality. As we enter the phase beyond limitations there is an urgent need for explicit treatment against COVID-19. To face this immediate global challenge, drug development from scratch is a lengthy process and unrealistic to conquer this battle. Drug repurposing is an emerging and practical approach where existing drugs, safe for humans, are redeployed to fight this harder to treat disease. A number of multi clinical studies have repurposed combined cocktail (remdesivir + chloroquine and favipiravir + chloroquine) to be effective against COVID-19. However, the exact mechanistic aspect has not yet been revealed. In the present study, we have tried to decipher the mechanistic aspects of existing medicines at the viral entry and replication stage via the structural viroinformatics approach. Here we implied the molecular docking and dynamic simulations with emphasis on the unique structural properties of host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV2 spike protein and RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme (RdRp) of the SARS-CoV2. Deep structural analysis of target molecules exposed key binding residues and structural twists involved in binding with important pharmacophore features of existing drugs [(7-chloro-N-[5-(diethylamino)pentan-2-yl]quinolin-4-amine (chloroquine),N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide) (SSAA09E2), 2-ethylbutyl (2S)-2-{[(S)-{[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-{4-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl}-5-cyano-3 (remdesivir) and 6-Fluor-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2-pyrazincarboxamid (favipiravir)]. It is evident from this structural informatics study that combo of chloroquine + SSAA09E2 with remdesivir or favipiravir could significantly restrain the virus at the entry and replication stage. Thus, drug repurposition is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost to treat COVID-19, we don't have enough time as the whole world is lockdown and we are in urgent need of an obvious therapeutics' measures.

TI  - The outcomes of favipiravir exposure in pregnancy: a case series
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
AB  - Purpose As in vitro and in vivo studies reported antiviral efficacy against RNA viruses, favipiravir, a pyrazinecarboxamide derivative, has become one of the treatment options for COVID-19 in some countries including Turkey. Preclinical studies demonstrated the risk for teratogenicity and embryotoxicity. Hence, the drug is contraindicated during pregnancy. Although limited in numbers, case-based evaluations indicate that favipiravir might not be a major teratogen in human pregnancies. This study aimed to present and analyze the outcomes of favipiravir exposure during pregnancy.
   Methods In this case series, the outcomes of nine pregnancies that were referred to the Teratology Information Service of Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Pharmacology between 01 April 2020 and 30 November 2021 were retrospectively evaluated.
   Results One spontaneous abortion, two elective terminations, one preterm live delivery and five term live deliveries were detected. The premature newborn was reported dead on the 5th day of neonatal intensive care unit admission. Physiological jaundice and transient respiratory distress were recorded in two term infants. One term infant was antenatally diagnosed with renal pelviectasis, but the findings resolved postnatally without requiring intervention.
   Conclusion The data indicate that favipiravir is not likely to be a major teratogen. Yet, it is not possible to draw a definite conclusion due to methodological limitations. Favipiravir exposures during pregnancy should be followed up closely and the outcomes should be reported consistently.

TI  - Potential pandemic pathogens series: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever
T2  - NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB  - In the last two years we have experienced the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in our lives and hospitals. Pandemics are part of the history of humanity and we can be certain that in the future new pandemics will appear. In fact, due to the growth in the human population, increased travel and global warming, it is to be expected that new pandemic pathogens will arise more frequently than before. Additionally, decreased barriers between animals and humans will give rise to spillover events, which will result in the introduction of new zoonotic pathogens in humans. In each of the parts of this series we will, in a short format, highlight a potential pandemic pathogen and describe its characteristics, history and potential for global pandemics. This part of the series focusses on the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a tick-borne disease, which is generally found in workers at farms and slaughterhouses and sometimes causes small outbreaks in families or hospital personal, as it can be spread by body fluids. Symptoms are unspecific, including myalgia, headache and fever. The disease course is often mild, but in patients who develop a haemorrhagic phase, the fatality rate is high. Treatment is primarily supportive but antiviral therapy including favipiravir and ribavirin are under investigation.

TI  - Nucleotide and nucleoside-based drugs: past, present, and future
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Nucleotide and nucleoside-based analogue drugs are widely used for the treatment of both acute and chronic viral infections. These drugs inhibit viral replication due to one or more distinct mechanisms. It modifies the virus's genetic structure by reducing viral capacity in every replication cycle. Their clinical success has shown strong effectiveness against several viruses, including ebolavirus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, MERS, SARS-Cov, and the most recent emergent SARS-Cov2. In this review, seven different types of inhibitors have been selected that show broad-spectrum activity against RNA viruses. A detailed over-view and mechanism of actionof both analogues are given, and the clinical perspectives are discussed. These inhibitors incorporated the novel SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, further terminating the polymerase activity with variable efficacy. The recent study provides a molecular basis for the inhibitory activity of virus RdRp using nucleotide and nucleoside analogues inhibitors. Furthermore, to identify those drugs that need more research and development to combat novel infections. Consequently, there is a pressing need to focus on present drugs by establishing their cell cultures. If their potencies were evidenced, then they would be explored in the future as potential therapeutics for novel outbreaks. (c) 2022 The Author.

TI  - Biopharmaceutics, Pharmacokinetics and Patent Evaluations of Drugs Used in the Treatment of COVID-19: Current Status in the Development of Generic Drugs in Turkey
T2  - GAZI MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - As a result of the rapid spread of COVID-19 and turning into a pandemic the deterioration of the condition of many people and the increase of deaths, caused the need for urgent treatment. There is no drug and/or vaccine approved by the health authorities for treatment because it is the first time the disease is encountered. The existing drugs are medicines used for other known indications in the treatment to relieve the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. This situation causes data insufficiency in the drugs and treatment approaches used and/or intended to be used, as well as insufficient data on the disease. In this review article, it is aimed to evaluate the biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics properties, treatment applications and clinical researches, generic drug development and patent status of the drugs used in COVID-19 treatment protocols in Turkey and worldwide, with current data.

TI  - Effects of the RNA-Polymerase Inhibitors Remdesivir and Favipiravir on the Structure of Lipid Bilayers-An MD Study
T2  - MEMBRANES
AB  - The structure and dynamics of membranes are crucial to ensure the proper functioning of cells. There are some compounds used in therapeutics that show nonspecific interactions with membranes in addition to their specific molecular target. Among them, two compounds recently used in therapeutics against COVID-19, remdesivir and favipiravir, were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation assays. In these, we demonstrated that the compounds can spontaneously bind to model lipid membranes in the presence or absence of cholesterol. These findings correlate with the corresponding experimental results recently reported by our group. In conclusion, insertion of the compounds into the membrane is observed, with a mean position close to the phospholipid head groups.

TI  - COVID-19: beta-thalassemia subjects immunised?
T2  - MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB  - The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a contagious acute respiratory infectious disease whose causative agent has been demonstrated to be a novel virus of the coronavirus family, SARSCoV-2. A recent PRE-print study has showed a heme attack on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin by COVID19. Beta-thalassemia results of a default in the hemoglobin beta-chain synthesis. 1,5% global population are heterozygotes for this disease. In this study, by a multiple linear regression, we have analyzed the evolution of COVID-19 infection in three Italian regions (Puglia, Sardinia, Sicilia) with different beta-thalassemic prevalences, in order to search a link. The results have showed that betathalassemic heterozygote population prevalence is correlated to immunity against COVID-19, by a regression. This paper is only for academic discussion, the hypotheses and conclusions needs to be confirmed by further research.

TI  - INTERACTIONS MECHANISM OF COMMONLY USED DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF COVID-19
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY OF ETHIOPIA
AB  - In this study conformation analysis of seven drugs commonly used in the treatment of COVID-19 was performed. The most stable conformers of the drug molecules were used as initial data for docking analysis. Using the Cavityplus program, the probable most active binding sites of both apo and holo forms of COVID-19 main protease enzyme (M-P(ro)) and spike glycoprotein of SARSCoV-2 receptors were determined. The interaction mechanisms of the 7 FDA approved drugs (arbidol, colchicine, dexamethasone, favipiravir, galidesivir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir) were examined using the AutoDock Vina program. The six of the seven drugs were found to be more stable in binding to apo form of COVID-19 M-P(ro) and spike glycoprotein. Moreover, a set of molecular mechanics (MM) Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) surface area (SA) calculations on the investigated drugs-protein systems were performed and the estimated binding free energy of remdesivir and the apo form of MP' system was found to be the best. The interaction results of FDA drugs with the apo form of COVID-19 M-P(ro) and spike glycoprotein can play an important role for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - The first case of COVID-19 in China was identified on December 1, 2019. It was reported to WHO on December 31, 2019. Now COVID-19 has turned into one of the greatest health disasters and is declared as a pandemic and a global threat by World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. COVID-19 was declared as global pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 is a pathogenic viral infection which easily transmits through respiratory droplets and transmitted through their contact instead of air transmission. It is considered most contagious when people are symptomatic, although transmission is possible before symptom. With the increase in number of cases of infected patients and rise in mortality rates, there weren't any definitive curative or preventive guidelines for physician to challenge this virus. Use of antiviral, immunotherapies, vaccines and other effective therapies are being investigated in different stages for evaluation of COVID-19. Trials of a number of drugs including remdesvir, ivermectin, hydoxychloroquine, chloroquine, favipiravir, merimepodib and lopinavir were reported. This review attempted to compile the outcomes and future research needs of these trials.

TI  - Optimization and evaluation of propolis liposomes as a promising therapeutic approach for COVID-19
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS
AB  - The present work aimed to develop an optimized liposomal formulation for enhancing the anti-viral activity of propolis against COVID-19. Docking studies were performed for certain components of Egyptian Propolis using Avigan, Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir as standard antivirals against both COVID-19 3CL-protease and S1 spike protein. Response surface methodology and modified injection method were implemented to maximize the entrapment efficiency and release of the liposomal formulation. The optimized formulation parameters were as follow: LMC of 60 mM, CH% of 20% and DL of 5 mg/ml. At those values the E.E% and released % were 70.112% and 81.801%, respectively with nanosized particles (117 +/- 11 nm). Docking studies revealed that Rutin and Caffeic acid phenethyl ester showed the highest affinity to both targets. Results showed a significant inhibitory effect of the optimized liposomal formula of Propolis against COVID-3CL protease (IC50 = 1.183 +/- 0.06) compared with the Egyptian propolis extract (IC50 = 2.452 +/- 0.11), P < 0.001. Interestingly, the inhibition of viral replication of COVID-19 determined by RT_PCR has been significantly enhanced via encapsulation of propolis extract within the liposomal formulation (P < 0.0001) and was comparable to the viral inhibitory effect of the potent antiviral (remdesivir). These findings identified the potential of propolis liposomes as a promising treatment approach against COVID-19.

TI  - Structural Elucidation of Alkali Degradation Impurities of Favipiravir from the Oral Suspension: UPLC-TQ-ESI-MS/MS and NMR
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - A novel stability-indicating, reversed-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was developed and validated for the determination of favipiravir in an oral suspension. The effective separation of favipiravir and its degradation products was achieved on a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column (5 mu m particle size, 150 mm length x 4.6 mm diameter). The mobile phase was prepared by mixing 5 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 3.5) and methanol in a 75:25 v/v ratio delivered at a 1.0 mL/min flow rate. The eluents were monitored using a photodiode array detector at a wavelength of 322 nm. The stability-indicating nature of this method was evaluated by performing force degradation studies under various stress conditions, such as acidic, alkali, oxidative, thermal, and photolytic degradation. Significant degradation was observed during the alkali stress degradation condition. The degradation products generated during various stress conditions were well separated from the favipiravir peak. In addition, the major degradation product formed under alkali stress conditions was identified using UPLC-ESI-TQ-MS/MS and NMR. Method validation was performed according to the ICH Q2 (R1) guideline requirements. The developed method is simple, accurate, robust, and reliable for routine quality control analysis of favipiravir oral suspensions.

TI  - A validated UHPLC-MS/MS method for simultaneous quantification of some repurposed COVID-19 drugs in rat plasma: Application to a pharmacokinetic study
T2  - MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Since the emergence of Corona virus disease (COVID-19) in 2019, a number of medications have been developed and tried to combat the pandemic. In the present study, we develop a LC-MS/MS approach to detect and quantify certain COVID-19 candidate drugs in rat plasma, including Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir, Oseltamivir, and Remdesivir. The analytes were separated using Ultra High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) over a 13-minute run on a C-18 column. The extraction solvent for the (QuEChERS) quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method was methanol, while the clean-up phase was primary secondary amine (PSA). Satisfactory recoveries were achieved for all compounds ranging from 82.39 to 105.87 %, with standard deviations smaller than 15.7. In terms of precision, accuracy, linearity, matrix effect, and stability, the method was validated according to US FDA criteria. The Limit of Detection (LOD) was determined to be between 0.11 and 10 ppb. The approach was further developed for a modest pharmacokinetic research in laboratory rats, and thus can be suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring in clinical cases under the same treatment.

TI  - Synthesis and characterization of two new mixed-ligand Cu(II) complexes of a tridentate NN'O type Schiff base ligand and N-donor heterocyclic co-ligands: In vitro anticancer assay, DNA/human leukemia/COVID-19 molecular docking studies, and pharmacophore modeling
T2  - APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY
AB  - Two new mixed-ligand complexes with general formula [Cu(SB)(L')]ClO4 (1 and 2) were synthesized and characterized by different spectroscopic and analytical techniques including Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and UV-Vis spectroscopy and elemental analyses. The SB ligand is an unsymmetrical tridentate NN'O type Schiff base ligand that was derived from the condensation of 1,2-ethylenediamine and 5-bromo-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzaldehyde. The L' ligand is pyridine in (1) and 2,2 '-dimethyl-4,4 '-bithiazole (BTZ) in (2). Crystal structure of (2) was also obtained. The two complexes were used as anticancer agents against leukemia cancer cell line HL-60 and showed considerable anticancer activity. The anticancer activity of these complexes was comparable with the standard drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Molecular docking and pharmacophore studies were also performed on DNA (PDB:1BNA) and leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) (PDB:1EMR) to further investigate the anticancer and anti-COVID activity of these complexes. The molecular docking results against DNA revealed that (1) preferentially binds to the major groove of DNA receptor whereas (2) binds to the minor groove. Complex (2) performed better with 1EMR. The experimental and theoretical results showed good correlation. Molecular docking and pharmacophore studies were also applied to study the interactions between the synthesized complexes and SARS-CoV-2 virus receptor protein (PDB ID:6LU7). The results revealed that complex (2) had better interaction than (1), the free ligands (SB and BTZ), and the standard drug favipiravir.

TI  - First Case of COVID-19 Positive Candida auris Fungemia in Turkey
T2  - MIKROBIYOLOJI BULTENI
AB  - Candida auris is a species of fungus that has gained importance in recent years owing to its ability to cause hospital infections and epidemics, resistant to antifungal agents and disinfection processes and frequently misidentified by commercial systems. Hospital outbreaks caused by C.auris have been reported from some countries. It has been determined that C.auris has lower virulence than Candida albicans; however, it is associated with high mortality rates in immunocompromised individuals. An increase in the incidence of invasive fungal infections which can lead to serious complications and death, has been identified in severe coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) patients or immunocompromised individuals with underlying disease. Studies demonstrated an increase in the frequency of C.auris isolation in COVID-19 patients with candidemia. In this report, the first case of COVID-19 positive C.auris fungemia detected in Turkey was presented. A 71-year-old male patient with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, donation of a single kidney and lobectomy surgery due to lung cancer was hospitalized in the pandemic thoracic surgery service due to the findings consistent with viral pneumonia on thoracic computed tomography. Favipiravir 2 x 600 mg and intravenous dexamethasone 1 x 6 mg therapy was administered. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction, and severe involvement of the left lung was detected in the following days. Antibiotics were administered, followed by insertion of a right jugular vein catheter and initation of tocilizumab. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit due to increased respiratory distress. Yeast growth was detected in the patient's hemoculture. The yeast strain could not be identified using API ID 32C (bioMerieux, France) (Sacchromyces kluyveri, Candida sake, unacceptable profile), but was identified as C.auris using the VITEK MALDI TOF MS (bioMerieux, France) (99.9%) system and confirmed by sequencing. The minimum inhibitor concentration values were detected as 3 mu g/ml for amphotericin B; > 256 mu g/ml for fluconazole; 0.19 mu g/ml for voriconazole; 0.19 mu g/ml for itraconazole; 0.016 mu g/ml for posaconazole; 1 mu g/ml for caspofungin and 0.094 mu g/ml for anidulafungin by using the antibiotic gradient method. The patient's initial treatment comprised meropenem 3 x 1 g, vancomycin 2 x 1 g, caspofungin 1 x 70 mg, and continued as caspofungine 1 x 50 mg after the loading dose, and vancomycin 1 x 1 g/48 hours from the third day of treatment. The patient died on the ninth day after developing candidemia. The present case is the first case of fungemia caused by C.auris in a COVID-19 positive patient in Turkey, and it emphasizes the need of caution for fungemia due to C.auris in intensive care units in our country which has a high COVID-19 incidence.

TI  - Potential limitations in systematic review studies assessing the effect of the main intervention for treatment/therapy of COVID-19 patients: An overview
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Although several studies have assessed the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of interventions in treating the COVID-19, many of them have limitations that can have an immense impact on their results. This study aims to assess the potential limitations in systematic reviews (SRs) that evaluate the effect of interventions on the treatment of the COVID-19. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences (WOS) databases were searched from inception to January 1, 2022. All systematic reviews investigated the effectiveness, efficacy, safety, and outcome of the main intervention (Favipiravir, Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Tocilizumab) for the treatment of COVID-19 patients and reported the potential limitations of the included studies. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Quality Assessment Tool (QAT) for review articles. We conducted a content analysis and prepared a narrative summary of the limitations. Results: Forty-six studies were included in this review. Ninety one percent of the included studies scored as strong quality and the remaining (9%) as moderate quality. Only 29.7% of the included systematic reviews have a registered protocol. 26% of the included studies mentioned a funding statement. The main limitations of the included studies were categorized in 10 domains: sample size, heterogeneity, follow-up, treatment, including studies, design, definitions, synthesis, quality, and search. Conclusion: Various limitations have been reported in all the included studies. Indeed, the existence of limitations in studies can affect their results, therefore, identifying these limitations can help researchers design better studies. As a result, stronger studies with more reliable results will be reported and disseminated. Further research on COVID-19 SRs is essential to improve research quality and also, efficiency among scientists across the world.

TI  - Dilemma of antiviral treatment in coronavirus 2019
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF CHEST DISEASES AND TUBERCULOSIS
AB  - There are four classes of Coronaviruses designated as alpha, beta, gamma and delta. CoV-2 attacks the lower respiratory system to cause severe pneumonia, but it may also affect other organs leading to multiple organ failure. The choice for antiviral treatment for CoV-2 depends on the timing and the severity of the case. Although there is no antiviral designed specifically for treating corona virus, several agents are tried such as hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Favipiravir. The mechanism of each drug is diacussed in detail below. In addition, ivermectin has started to emerge as a new candidate therapeutic against SARSCoV-2/ COVID-19.

TI  - Structural Basis for the Understanding of Entry Inhibitors against SARS Viruses
T2  - CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Outbreaks due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona virus 2 (SARSCoV-2) initiated in Wuhan city, China, in December 2019 and continued to spread Internationally, posing a pandemic threat as declared by WHO and as of March 10, 2021, confirmed cases reached 118 million along with 2.6 million deaths worldwide. In the absence of specific antiviral medication, symptomatic treatment and physical isolation remain the options to control the disease and contagion. The recent clinical trials on antiviral drugs highlighted some promising compounds such as umifenovir (haemagglutininand has only 70% similarity to SAmediated fusion inhibitor), remdesivir (RdRp nucleoside inhibitor), and favipiravir (RdRp Inhibitor). WHO launched a multinational clinical trial on several promising analogs as a potential treatment to combat SARS infection. This situation urges a holistic approach to invent safe and specific drugs as a prophylactic and therapeutic cure for SARS-related viral diseases, including COVID-19. It is significant to note that researchers worldwide have been doing their best to handle the crisis and have produced an extensive and promising literature body. It opens a scope and allows understanding the viral entry at the molecular level. A structure-based approach can reveal the molecular-level understanding of viral entry interaction. The ligand profiling and non-covalent interactions among participating amino-acid residues are critical information to delineate a structural interpretation. The structural investigation of SARS virus entry into host cells will reveal the possible strategy for designing drugs like entry inhibitors. The structure-based approach demonstrates details at the 3D molecular level. It shows specificity about SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction, which uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry, and the human protease completes the process of viral fusion and infection. The 3D structural studies reveal the existence of two units, namely S1 and S2. S1 is called a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and responsible for interacting with the host (ACE2), and the S2 unit participates in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. TMPRSS2 mediates the cleavage at the S1/S2 subunit interface in the S-protein of SARS CoV-2, leading to viral fusion. Conformational difference associated with S1 binding alters ACE2 interaction and inhibits viral fusion. Overall, the detailed 3D structural studies help understand the 3D structural basis of interaction between viruses with host factors and open scope for the new drug discovery process targeting SARS-related virus entry into the host cell.

TI  - HPLC-UV method for quantification of favipiravir in pharmaceutical formulations
T2  - ACTA CHROMATOGRAPHICA
AB  - Favipiravir (FVP), a pyrazine analog, has shown antiviral activity against a wide variety of viruses. It is considered to be worth further investigation as a potential candidate drug for COVID-19. It is not officially available in any pharmacopoeia. A rapid, simple, precise, accurate, and isocratic high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed for routine quality control of favipiravir in pharmaceutical formulations. Separation was carried out by C18 column. The mobile phase was a mixture of 50 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 2.3) and acetonitrile (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1). The ultraviolet (UV) detection and column temperature were 323 nm, and 30 degrees C, respectively. The run time was 15 min under these chromatographic conditions. Excellent linear relationship between peak area and favipiravir concentration in the range of 10-100 mg mL(-1) has been observed (r(2), 0.9999). Developed method has been found to be sensitive (limits of detection and quantification were 1.20 mg mL(-1) and 3.60 mg mL(-1), respectively), precise (the interday and intraday relative standard deviation (RSD) values for peak area and retention time were less than 0.4 and 0.2%, respectively), accurate (recovery, 99.19-100.17%), specific and robust (% RSD were less than 1.00, for system suitability parameters). Proposed method has been successfully applied for quantification of favipiravir in pharmaceutical formulations.

TI  - Plain H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance analysis streamlines the quality control of antiviral favipiravir and congeneric World Health Organization essential medicines
T2  - MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN CHEMISTRY
AB  - Favipiravir is an established antiviral that is currently being assessed as an investigational drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Favipiravir is strikingly similar to two molecules that the World Health Organization (WHO) lists as essential medicines, which also consist of a six-membered aromatic N-heterocycle bearing a carboxamide function: the anti-tuberculosis agent, pyrazinamide, and nicotinamide, also known as vitamin B-3. We demonstrate the utility of H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) profiling, an emerging pharmacopoeial tool, for the highly specific identification, selective differentiation of congeners, and subsequent detection of drug falsification or adulteration of these medicines. The straightforward comparison of basic 1-D H-1 NMR spectra, obtained with benchtop or advanced NMR instruments alike, offers a rapid identity assay and works independently of physical reference materials. This approach accelerates and advances pharmaceutical quality control measures under situations of increased drug demand and altered economy, such as during a pandemic.

AB  - The top priority of any nation is to lead the nation towards prosperity, progress, and economic growth, confronting several challenges and concerns arisen from global situations. The sudden outbreak of any disease defies the health care systems and economy of nations. COVID-19 is one of the viral diseases which broke out in Wuhan city of China in 2019. COVID-19 outbreak intermittently prevailed all over the world. It exposes the fragility of the established health care systems across the world in spite of comprising modern science and technology. Unfortunately, there is no chemotherapeutic agent in the regimen of antiviral drugs or no vaccine available to curb this infectious disease. As a consequence, this deadly infection has prevailed all over the world. The antiviral drugs used for viral diseases excluding COVID-19 infection are Ramdesvir, Favipiravir, and Ribavarin, and antimalarial agents (Chloroquine & Hydroxychloroquine) are being administered to the patients for redemption of this infection. Fortunately, these existing drugs have been found clinically active and are being used. In this review, we present the current scenario and status of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, vaccine development for COVID-19, and its impact on the socio-economic structure.

T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN RESPIRATORY DISEASE
AB  - COVID-19 has grown into a global pandemic that has strained healthcare throughout the world. There is a sense of urgency in finding a cure for this deadly virus. In this study, we reviewed the empiric options used in common practice for COVID-19, based on the literature available online, with an emphasis on human experiences with these treatments on severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-COV-1) and other viruses. Convalescent blood products are the most promising potential treatment for use in COVID-19. The use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, and tocilizumab are some of the other promising potential therapies; however, they are yet to be tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The use of lopinavir-ritonavir did not prove beneficial in a large RCT. The use of corticosteroids should be avoided in COVID-19 pneumonia unless used for other indications, based on the suggestion of harm in patients with SARS-COV-1 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection.

TI  - Emerging and experimental treatments for COVID-19 and drug interactions with psychotropic agents
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - As yet, no agents have been approved for the treatment of COVID-19, although several experimental drugs are being used off licence. These may have serious adverse effects and potential drug interactions with psychotropic agents. We reviewed the common agents being used across the world for the treatment of COVID-19 and investigated their drug interaction potential with psychotropic agents using several drug interaction databases and resources. A preliminary search identified the following drugs as being used to treat COVID-19 symptoms: atazanavir (ATV), azithromycin (AZI), chloroquine (CLQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCLQ), dipyridamole, famotidine (FAM), favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), nitazoxanide, remdesivir, ribavirin and tocilizumab. Many serious adverse effects and potential drug interactions with psychotropic agents were identified. The most problematic agents were found to be ATV, AZI, CLQ, HCLQ, FAM and LPV/r in terms of both pharmacokinetic as well as serious pharmacodynamic drug interactions, including QTc prolongation and neutropenia. Significant caution should be exercised if using any of the medications being trialled for the treatment of COVID-19 until robust clinical trial data are available. An even higher threshold of vigilance should be maintained for patients with pre-existing conditions and older adults due to added toxicity and drug interactions, especially with psychotropic agents.

TI  - Eco-friendly spectrophotometric methods for determination of remdesivir and favipiravir; the recently approved antivirals for COVID-19 treatment
T2  - SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY
AB  - Remdesivir (REM) and Favipiravir (FAV) are recently approved antivirals prescribed in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Therefore, development of new, simple, rapid, sensitive, and selective methods for analysis of such drugs in their pharmaceutical formulations will be highly advantageous. Herein, we have developed different spectrophotometric methods for analysis of the studied analytes. Method I is based on direct spectrophotometric analysis of REM and FAV in ethanol at lambda max 244 and 323 nm, respectively. For simultaneous quantitation of REM and FAV, methods II-V were followed. Method II is based on derivative spectrophotometry in which REM was determined in second-order derivative spectra at 248 nm (the zero-crossing wavelength for FAV), while FAV was measured in first-order derivative spectra at 337 nm (the zero-crossing point for REM). Method III is the dualwavelength method in which spectral intensities were subtracted at 244-207 nm for REM and at 330-400 nm for FAV. Method IV is the ratio subtraction in which ratio spectra were obtained by a suitable divisor followed by subtraction of intensities at 272-340 nm and 335-222 nm for REM and FAV, respectively. Method V is the derivative ratio method in which the obtained ratio spectra in method IV were converted to first-order derivative and then REM and FAV were recorded at 280 and 340 nm, respectively. Calibration graphs were linear in the ranges of 1-10 mu g/mL for REM through all methods and 1-20 mu g/mL for FAV in methods I and II, and 2-20 mu g/ mL by the other methods. The evolved methods were applied to pharmaceutical dosage forms of REM and FAV. All the proposed methods were further applied to human plasma samples containing both drugs with acceptable mean recoveries.

TI  - Bilateral acute Iris transillumination after COVID-19 pneumonia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB  - Purpose To report the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of a case of bilateral acute iris transillumination (BAIT) developed after COVID-19 pneumonia. Method Case report. Case A 66-year-old male patient with COVID-19 pneumonia received systemic treatments of favipiravir, prednisolone, moxifloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam during hospitalization. The patient applied to our clinic with the complaint of blurred vision 20 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.3 in the right eye and 0.5 in the left eye. In the anterior segment examination; ciliary injection, intense pigment dispersion in the anterior chamber, pigment deposits on the lens and iris, 2-3 + cells in the anterior chamber, posterior synechia, and 360 degrees diffuse iris transillumination were observed in both eyes. The pupillary response to light was weak. Bilateral fundus examination were normal. In the anterior chamber sample; HSV, VZV, CMV and Toxoplasma PCR were negative. Bilateral acute iris transillumination (BAIT) diagnosed in the patient and topical 0.1% dexamethasone and topical 1% cyclopentolate were started. In the follow-up, visual acuity increased 1.0 in both eyes, there were no cells in the anterior chamber, and the pigment dispersion was still continuing despite a decrease. Conclusion BAIT, which can usually be seen after upper respiratory tract infections, can also be seen after covid 19 pneumonia and be kept in mind as a possible eye involvement in patients with COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Predictive factors for a severe course of COVID-19 infection in myasthenia gravis patients with an overall impact on myasthenic outcome status and survival
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background and purpose Myasthenia gravis (MG) patients could be a vulnerable group in the pandemic era of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) mainly due to respiratory muscle weakness, older age and long-term immunosuppressive treatment. We aimed to define factors predicting the severity of COVID-19 in MG patients and risk of MG exacerbation during COVID-19. Methods We evaluated clinical features and outcomes after COVID-19 in 93 MG patients. Results Thirty-five patients (38%) had severe pneumonia and we recorded 10 deaths (11%) due to COVID-19. Higher forced vital capacity (FVC) values tested before COVID-19 were shown to be protective against severe infection (95% CI 0.934-0.98) as well as good control of MG measured by the quantified myasthenia gravis score (95% CI 1.047-1.232). Long-term chronic corticosteroid treatment worsened the course of COVID-19 in MG patients (95% CI 1.784-111.43) and this impact was positively associated with dosage (p = 0.005). Treatment using azathioprine (95% CI 0.448-2.935), mycophenolate mofetil (95% CI 0.91-12.515) and ciclosporin (95% CI 0.029-2.212) did not influence the course of COVID-19. MG patients treated with rituximab had a high risk of death caused by COVID-19 (95% CI 3.216-383.971). Exacerbation of MG during infection was relatively rare (15%) and was not caused by remdesivir, convalescent plasma or favipiravir (95% CI 0.885-10.87). Conclusions As the most important predictors of severe COVID-19 in MG patients we identified unsatisfied condition of MG with lower FVC, previous long-term corticosteroid treatment especially in higher doses, older age, the presence of cancer, and recent rituximab treatment.

TI  - Cardiac safety of off-label COVID-19 drug therapy: a review and proposed monitoring protocol
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - More than 2,000,000 individuals worldwide have had coronavirus 2019 disease infection (COVID-19), yet there is no effective medical therapy. Multiple off-label and investigational drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have gained broad interest due to positive pre-clinical data and are currently used for treatment of COVID-19. However, some of these medications have potential cardiac adverse effects. This is important because up to one-third of patients with COVID-19 have cardiac injury, which can further increase the risk of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Adverse effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on cardiac function and conduction are broad and can be fatal. Both drugs have an anti-arrhythmic property and are proarrhythmic. The American Heart Association has listed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as agents which can cause direct myocardial toxicity. Similarly, other investigational drugs such as favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir can prolong QT interval and cause Torsade de Pointes. Many antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, for instance azithromycin, can also prolong QT interval. This review summarizes evidenced-based data regarding potential cardiac adverse effects due to off-label and investigational drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, antiviral therapy, monoclonal antibodies, as well as common antibiotics used for the treatment of COVID-19. The article focuses on practical points and offers a point-of-care protocol for providers who are taking care of patients with COVID-19 in an inpatient and outpatient setting. The proposed protocol is taking into consideration that resources during the pandemic are limited.

TI  - Impact of cytokine storm on severity of COVID-19 disease in a private hospital in West Jakarta prior to vaccination
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background and aim
   Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic and is a threat to global health. Patients who experienced cytokine storms tend to have a high mortality rate. However, to date, no study has investigated the impact of cytokine storms.
   Materials and methods
   This retrospective cohort study included only COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized in a Private Hospital in West Jakarta between March and September 2020. All patients were not vaccinated during this period and treatment was based on the guidelines by the Ministry of Health Indonesia. A convenience sampling method was used and all patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled.
   Results
   The clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients following medical therapy was either cured (85.7%) or died (14.3%), with 14.3% patients reported to have cytokine storm, from which 23.1% led to fatalities. A plasma immunoglobulin (Gammaraas (R)) and/or tocilizumab (interleukin-6 receptor antagonist; Actemra (R)) injection was utilised to treat the cytokine storm while remdesivir and oseltamivir were administered to ameliorate COVID-19. Most (61.5%) patients who experienced the cytokine storm were male; mean age 60 years. Interestingly, all patients who experienced the cytokine storm had hypertension or/ and diabetes complication (100%). Fever, cough and shortness of breath were also the common symptoms (100.0%). Almost all (92.3%) patients with cytokine storm had to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most (76.9%) patients who had cytokine storm received hydroxychloroquine and all had antibiotics [1) azithromycin + levofloxacin or 2) meropenam for critically ill patients] and vitamins such as vitamins C and B-complex as well as mineral. Unfortunately, from this group, 23.1% patients died while the remaining 70% of patients recovered. A significant (p<0.05) correlation was established between cytokine storms and age, the presence of comorbidity, diabetes, hypertension, fever, shortness of breath, having oxygen saturation (SPO2) less than 93%, cold, fatigue, ward of admission, the severity of COVID19 disease, duration of treatment as well as the use of remdesivir, Actemra (R) and Gammaraas (R). Most patients recovered after receiving a combination treatment (oseltamivir + remdesivir + Antibiotics + Vitamin/Mineral) for approximately 11 days with a 90% survival rate. On the contrary, patients who received oseltamivir + hydroxychloroquine + Gammaraas (R) + antibiotics +Vitamin/Mineral, had a 83% survival rate after being admitted to the hospital for about ten days.
   Conclusion
   Factors influencing the development of a cytokine storm include age, duration of treatment, comorbidity, symptoms, type of admission ward and severity of infection. Most patients (76.92%) with cytokine storm who received Gammaraas (R)/Actemra (R), survived although they were in the severe and critical levels (87.17%). Overall, based on the treatment duration and survival rate, the most effective therapy was a combination of oseltamivir + favipiravir + hydroxychloroquine + antibiotics + vitamins/minerals.

TI  - The broad-spectrum antiviral recommendations for drug discovery against COVID-19
T2  - DRUG METABOLISM REVIEWS
AB  - Despite to outbreaks of highly pathogenic beta and alpha coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and human coronavirus, the newly emerged 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) is considered as a lethal zoonotic virus due to its deadly respiratory syndrome and high mortality rate among the human. Globally, more than 3,517,345 cases have been confirmed with 243,401 deaths due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19. The antiviral drug discovery activity is required to control the persistence of COVID-19 circulation and the potential of the future emergence of coronavirus. However, the present review aims to highlight the important antiviral approaches, including interferons, ribavirin, mycophenolic acids, ritonavir, lopinavir, inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to provoke the nonstructural proteins and deactivate the structural and essential host elements of the virus to control and treat the infection of COVID-19 by inhibiting the viral entry, viral RNA replication and suppressing the viral protein expression. Moreover, the present review investigates the epidemiology, diagnosis, structure, and replication of COVID-19 for better understanding. It is recommended that these proteases, inhibitors, and antibodies could be a good therapeutic option in drug discovery to control the newly emerged coronavirus.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy prescribing pattern and outcome for hospitalized patients with severe and critical COVID-19
T2  - CURRENT ISSUES IN PHARMACY AND MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - There are many treatment modalities for COVID-19 - with varied outcome. Therefore, authors designed this study to assess prescribing patterns and the clinical outcome for hospitalized patients with severe and critical COVID-19 so as to determine the most effective approach.
   Authors conducted a retrospective observational study on 346 adult patients with either severe or critical COVID-19, who were admitted to public hospitals in Al-Najaf city, Iraq from June to September 2020. Patients' information, medications and outcomes were collected from their medical records in the registered office of the hospital.
   A total of 346 patients were enrolled, with a majority of patients being adults above 35 years old and male (70.2%). Most patients (81%) received corticosteroid as dexamethasone, and about 45% of all patients were given convalescent plasma therapy, while a few patients were prescribed antiviral favipiravir (23%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (19%). As supportive care medications, anticoagulant such as enoxaparin was administered to most of the patients (93%) and more than half of all patients received the broad-spectrum antibiotic, meropenem.
   The majority of the patients recovered and were discharged alive (66%), however, the inhospital mortality rate was 26%. Interestingly, patients treated with enoxaparin alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine were associated with better outcome.
   The prescribing pattern of COVID-19 specific medications and supportive care is aligned with guideline recommendations and associated with a beneficial therapeutic outcome.

TI  - QSPR Modeling with Topological Indices of Some Potential Drug Candidates against COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS
AB  - COVID-19, which has spread all over the world and was declared as a pandemic, is a new disease caused by the coronavirus family. There is no medicine yet to prevent or end this pandemic. Even if existing drugs are used to alleviate the pandemic, this is not enough. Therefore, combinations of existing drugs and their analogs are being studied. Vaccines produced for COVID-19 may not be effective for new variants of this virus. Therefore, it is necessary to find the drugs for this disease as soon as possible. Topological indices are the numerical descriptors of a molecular structure obtained by the molecular graph. Topological indices can provide information about the physicochemical properties and biological properties of molecules in the quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. In this paper, some analogs of lopinavir, favipiravir, and ritonavir drugs that have the property of being potential drugs against COVID-19 are studied. QSPR models are studied using linear and quadratic regression analysis with topological indices for enthalpy of vaporization, flash point, molar refractivity, polarizability, surface tension, and molar volume properties of these analogs.

TI  - Intracranial Aneurysm Rupture after SARS-CoV2 Infection: Case Report and Review of Literature
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Background: SARS-CoV virus infection results in a dysbalanced and severe inflammatory response with hypercytokinemia and immunodepression. Viral infection triggers systemic inflammation and the virus itself can potentially cause vascular damage, including blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and alterations in the coagulation system, which may result in cardiovascular and neurovascular events. Here, we review the literature and present a case of COVID-19 infection leading to an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH). Case Description: A 61-year-old woman presented with dyspnea, cough, and fever. She had a history of hypertension and was overweight with a body mass-index of 34. There was no history of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the family. Due to low oxygen saturation (89%) she was admitted into ICU. A chest CT showed a typical picture of COVID-19 pneumonia. The PCR-based test of an oropharyngeal swab was COVID-19-positive. In addition to oxygen support she was prescribed with favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. She experienced a sudden headache and lost consciousness on the second day. Computer tomography (CT) with CT-angiography revealed a subarachnoid haemorrhage in the basal cisterns from a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was clipped microsurgically through a left-sided standard pterional approach and the patient was admitted again to the intensive care unit for further intensive medical treatment. Post-operatively, the patient showed slight motor dysphasia. No other neurological deficits. Conclusion: Systemic inflammation and ventilator support-associated blood pressure fluctuations may trigger aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage secondary to COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 infection could be considered as one of the possible risk factors leading to instability and rupture of intracranial aneurysm.

TI  - Ab Initio Insight into the Interaction of Metal-Decorated Fluorinated Carbon Fullerenes with Anti-COVID Drugs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - We theoretically investigated the adsorption of two common anti-COVID drugs, favipiravir and chloroquine, on fluorinated C-60 fullerene, decorated with metal ions Cr3+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Ni2+. We focused on the effect of fluoridation on the interaction of fullerene with metal ions and drugs in an aqueous solution. We considered three model systems, C-60, C60F2 and C60F48, and represented pristine, low-fluorinated and high-fluorinated fullerenes, respectively. Adsorption energies, deformation of fullerene and drug molecules, frontier molecular orbitals and vibrational spectra were investigated in detail. We found that different drugs and different ions interacted differently with fluorinated fullerenes. Cr3+ and Fe2+ ions lead to the defluorination of low-fluorinated fullerenes. Favipiravir also leads to their defluorination with the formation of HF molecules. Therefore, fluorinated fullerenes are not suitable for the delivery of favipiravir and similar drugs molecules. In contrast, we found that fluorine enhances the adsorption of Ni2+ and Fe3+ ions on fullerene and their activity to chloroquine. Ni2+-decorated fluorinated fullerenes were found to be stable and suitable carriers for the loading of chloroquine. Clear shifts of infrared, ultraviolet and visible spectra can provide control over the loading of chloroquine on Ni2+-doped fluorinated fullerenes.

TI  - Electrochemistry and Determination of an Antiviral Drug at Ionic Liquids Crystals-Carbon Nanotubes Modified Glassy Carbon Electrode
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB  - Favipiravir (Fav) is an antiviral drug administered for the treatment of pulmonary infection and is also among the approved drugs for the treatment of lung inflammation in humans infected with COVID-19. Here we introduce the electrochemical behavior of Fav at ionic liquid crystals (ILCs)-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified electrode. The proposed electrode is ready for use in a one-step preparation protocol, is employed with low-cost instrumentation, and is distinctly sensitive and selective for the determination of the drug both in human serum and in commercially available medications. Ionic liquid crystals allow ionic interaction with the drug to realize its surface preconcentration. The limits of detection and quantification for the determination of Fav in blood-serum within the concentration range 0.9 to 150 mu mol l(-1) are 0.0161 and 0.119 mu mol l(-1), respectively. The sensor proved effective in the concurrent determination of several drugs used as prescribed "add-on" medication for the virus or for the treatment of other chronic diseases of some patients.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Liver Transplantation Recipients With COVID-19 Pneumonia
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
AB  - Background. We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of mild-severe COVID-19 pneumonia cases in liver transplant (LT) recipients.
   Methods. Ten LT recipients diagnosed as having COVID-19 pneumonia in a 6-month period in our transplantation center were included. Demographic and medical data of the recipients were retrospectively collected; clinical courses, treatment responses, and outcomes were evaluated.
   Results. Ten LT recipients were male, had a median age of 57 years (min-max, 36-69 years; interquartile range [IQR], 13 years), and had right lobe from living donor LT performed in a median of 11 months (min-max, 1-72 months; IQR, 12 months). Five patients had severe pneumonia, and the remaining patients had mild/moderate pneumonia. The most frequent symptoms were fever (90%) and cough (70%). Favipiravir, enoxaparin sodium, and corticosteroid were initiated at the time of the diagnosis; immunosuppressive drug doses were reduced or discontinued in 3 cases. Lymphopenia median: 510/mL (min-max, 90-1400 mL; IQR, 610 mL), increased levels of C-reactive protein median: 4.72 (min-max, 0.31-23.4; IQR, 8.5), and ferritin median: 641 (min-max, 40 to >= 1650; IQR, 1108) were frequent. Four patients required antibacterial treatments because of emerging bacterial pneumonia and/or sepsis. All patients were hospitalized for a median of 10 days. One patient with sepsis died on the 26th day after intensive care unit admission, and the remaining 9 survived. No further complication was recorded for 1-month follow-up.
   Conclusions. Commencing favipiravir, enoxaparin sodium, and corticosteroid treatments; close follow-up of the developing complications; the temporary reduction or cessation of immunosuppression; a multidisciplinary approach; early awareness of the bacterial infections; and the initiation appropriate antibiotic treatments can contribute to success.

TI  - Development of a colorimetric assay for quantification of favipiravir in human serum using ferrihydrite
T2  - TALANTA
AB  - We developed a colorimetric analytical method for favipiravir (FPV), a promising treatment for COVID-19. FPV forms yellow complexes with ferrihydrite (Fh) by a ligand substitution reaction with the iron (III) hydroxyl surface groups in Fh. Fh-coated microbeads were packed into a capillary tube with an inner diameter of 1 mm. FPV-spiked serum after pretreatment was drawn into the capillary packed with Fh-coated microbeads. The in-tensities of the yellow-color complexes on the microbeads were transformed into red-green-blue (RGB) pixels using Image-J software 1.8, and the difference between green and blue was used as the analytical signal. The signal increased with increasing FPV concentration. The proposed method showed good linearity (R-2 = 0.9907) over a concentration range of 25-200 mu g/mL. The RSD (n = 3) and the LOD (3 sigma) values were estimated to be 2.8-15.4% and 16.91 mu g/mL, respectively. The proposed method enables us to quantify FPV rapidly and easily without the need for expensive equipment.

TI  - Interactions of anti-COVID-19 drug candidates with hepatic transporters may cause liver toxicity and affect pharmacokinetics
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Transporters in the human liver play a major role in the clearance of endo- and xenobiotics. Apical (canalicular) transporters extrude compounds to the bile, while basolateral hepatocyte transporters promote the uptake of, or expel, various compounds from/into the venous blood stream. In the present work we have examined the in vitro interactions of some key repurposed drugs advocated to treat COVID-19 (lopinavir, ritonavir, ivermectin, remdesivir and favipiravir), with the key drug transporters of hepatocytes. These transporters included ABCB11/BSEP, ABCC2/MRP2, and SLC47A1/MATE1 in the canalicular membrane, as well as ABCC3/MRP3, ABCC4/MRP4, SLC22A1/OCT1, SLCO1B1/OATP1B1, SLCO1B3/OATP1B3, and SLC10A1/NTCP, residing in the basolateral membrane. Lopinavir and ritonavir in low micromolar concentrations inhibited BSEP and MATE1 exporters, as well as OATP1B1/1B3 uptake transporters. Ritonavir had a similar inhibitory pattern, also inhibiting OCT1. Remdesivir strongly inhibited MRP4, OATP1B1/1B3, MATE1 and OCT1. Favipiravir had no significant effect on any of these transporters. Since both general drug metabolism and drug-induced liver toxicity are strongly dependent on the functioning of these transporters, the various interactions reported here may have important clinical relevance in the drug treatment of this viral disease and the existing co-morbidities.

TI  - Review the Use of Antivirus for COVID-19 Treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT
AB  - On 31 January 2020, World announced COVID-19 as an Emergency Public Health of International Concern. The number of patients in Indonesia continues to grow. Anti-viral in the COVID-19 Drug Information Laboratory in Indonesia are Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Favipiravir, Remdemsivir, Oseltamivir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxychloroquine Phosphate. Therefore, it is necessary to know the basis and management of its use. An online systematic search was performed on articles published until 30 March 2020. We use search keywords that are tailored to the purpose of writing. All six antivirals were used for the treatment of RNA virus. Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir effectively control the SARS-CoV2 virus invitro. Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Hydroxychloroquine and Oseltamivir have been used clinically for the treatment of SARS-CoV2 virus. In 2020, there are 42 clinical trials of six antivirals. Guidance of the antivirus are from China, Belgium and Indonesia. Its differences are based on the patient's condition. There is a lack of evidence of six antiviral effectiveness against the SARS-CoV2 virus. It has been used for other RNA viruses. It is supported by a safety profile. In a pandemic situation and the absence of a specific antivirus, the use of the six antiviruses can be done and be useful.

TI  - Development and Validation of HPLC-DAD Method for the Determination of Favipiravir and Studying the Impact of Vitamin C on the Pharmacokinetics of COVID-19 Antiviral Drug Favipiravir
T2  - SEPARATIONS
AB  - A novel, sensitive, and low-cost HPLC method for the rapid determination of favipiravir (FVR) in rat plasma was developed and validated, and the effect of vitamin C on FVR pharmacokinetic parameters was investigated. FVR and oxcarbazepine (IS) were separated using a mobile phase of 50% acetonitrile and 50% water (with 0.25% trifluoroacetic acid) at 1.0 mL/min flow rate and detected at lambda max 289 nm. The intra- and interday values for FVR in plasma were less than 15%, with low, medium, and high QC levels for the relative recovery rate, according to ICH guidelines. Cmax values in the control and experimental groups were 558 +/- 124.42 and 979.13 +/- 138.10 ng/mL, respectively; t(1/2) values were 7.15 +/- 1.60 and 9.09 +/- 1.14 h, AUC((0-t)) values were 5697.70 +/- 536.58 and 7381.62 +/- 1577.58 ng.h/mL, and AUC((0-infinity)) values were 5697.70 +/- 536.58 and 8192.36 +/- 1721.67, respectively. According to the results, the experimental group's Cmax of FVR was 75.17% higher than the control group's, the Vz/F was lower, and the t(1/2) was 1.86 h longer. The technique developed for determining FVR in plasma was useful for FVR pharmacokinetics and food-drug interaction investigations.

TI  - Metal doped fullerene complexes as promising drug delivery materials against COVID-19
T2  - CHEMICAL PAPERS
AB  - An outbreak of respiratory disorder caused by coronavirus has been named as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19). To find a specific treatment against this disease researchers are at the frontline. To cure COVID-19, favipiravir (FPV) has been reported as an effective drug based on its high recovery rate. Among nanomaterials, fullerene C60 has achieved enormous attention as a drug delivery vehicle due to its good bioavailability and low toxicity. Hence, in this work, we have investigated the potential of metal-doped fullerene as a drug carrier, based on DFT calculations by using M06-2X functional and 6-31G(d) basis set in water media. In this research electronic parameters and adsorption energy of FPV on interaction with metal-doped (Cr, Fe, and Ni) fullerene is studied. The charge transfer between drug and doped fullerene has been studied through electrophilicity indexes. The structural and electronic properties are explored in terms of adsorption energy through frontier molecular orbital (FMO) and density of state (DOS). It is observed that doping of fullerene C60 with Cr, Fe, and Ni metals significantly enhances the drug delivery rate and provides numerous advantages including controlled drug release at specific target sites which minimize the generic collection in vivo and reduce the side effects. Thusly, it is suggested that our designed metal-doped complexes might be efficient candidates as drug delivery materials for COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Instruction of molecular structure similarity and scaffolds of drugs under investigation in ebola virus treatment by atom-pair and graph network: A combination of favipiravir and molnupiravir
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - The virus that causes Ebola is fatal. Although many researchers have attempted to contain this deadly infection, the fatality rate remains high. The atom-pair fingerprint technique was used to compare drugs suggested for the treatment of Ebola or those that are currently being tested in clinical settings. Subsequently, using scaffold network graph (SNG) methods, the molecular and structural scaffolds of the drugs chosen based on these similar results were created, and the drug structures were examined. Public databases (PubChem and DrugBank) and literature regarding Ebola treatment were used in the analysis. Graphical representations of the molecular architecture and core structures of the drugs with the highest similarity to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved drugs were produced using the SNG method. The combination of molnupiravir, the first licensed oral medication candidate for COVID-19, and favipiravir, employed in other viral outbreaks, should be further researched for treating Ebola, as observed in our study. We also believe that chemists will benefit from understanding the core structure(s) of medication molecules effective against the Ebola virus, their inhibitors, and the chemical structure similarities of existing pharmaceuticals utilized to build alternative drugs or drug combinations.

TI  - Adverse Audio-Vestibular Effects of Drugs and Vaccines Used in the Treatment and Prevention of COVID-19: A Review
T2  - AUDIOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - (1) Background: The purpose of this article is to review pharmacological treatments for COVID-19 (currently approved by the EMA (European Medical Agency) and FDA (Food and Drug Administration)) and highlight their potential audio-vestibular side-effects as an ototoxic adverse reaction. (2) Methods: Review of the available literature in the scientific databases PubMed, ResearchGate, Scopus, and ScienceDirect, and in summaries of product data sheets. (3) Results: In accordance with EBM (evidence-based medicine) the treatment of COVID-19 by using lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, favipiravir, amantadine, oseltamivir, and ivermectin is no longer recommended for patients suffering from COVID-19 due to a lack of clinical data, publications, and recommendations. There were 39 publications and 15 summaries of product characteristics (as other sources of data) which were also used in this analysis. Adverse events could be permanent or disappear over time. Following treatment for COVID-19, the most frequent adverse audio-vestibular reactions reported in clinical trials and publications in the area of audiology and otorhinolaryngology were: dizziness, blurry vision with dizziness, nasopharyngitis, dysgeusia, and tinnitus. As far as vaccines are concerned, dizziness as an ototoxic effect was uncommon and occurs only in hypersensitive people who experience anaphylactic shock. (4) Conclusions: The ototoxicity of the drugs discussed here does not have as severe symptoms as the drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 in 2020 (e.g., hydroxychloroquine), and relates mainly to disorders of the vestibulocochlear system. However, there is still a need to monitor ototoxic side-effects because of potential interactions with other ototoxic drugs. Many of the drugs approved by EMA and FDA are new, and not every side-effect is known.

TI  - Outcomes of patients with end stage kidney disease on dialysis with COVID-19 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; from PCR to antibody
T2  - BMC NEPHROLOGY
AB  - Background Individuals with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis are vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 infection, with mortality as high as 31 % in this group. Population demographics in the UAE are dissimilar to many other countries and data on antibody responses to COVID-19 is also limited. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients who developed COVID-19, the impact of the screening strategy, and to assess the antibody response to a subset of dialysis patients. Methods We retrospectively examined the outcomes of COVID19 infection in all our haemodialysis patients, who were tested regularly for COVID 19, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. In addition, IgG antibody serology was also performed to assess response to COVID-19 in a subset of patients. Results 152 (13 %) of 1180 dialysis patients developed COVID-19 during the study period from 1st of March to the 1st of July 2020. Of these 81 % were male, average age of 52 years and 95 % were on in-centre haemodialysis. Family and community contact was most likely source of infection in most patients. Fever (49 %) and cough (48 %) were the most common presenting symptoms, when present. Comorbidities in infected individuals included hypertension (93 %), diabetes (49 %), ischaemic heart disease (30 %). The majority (68 %) developed mild disease, whilst 13 % required critical care. Combinations of drugs including hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, camostat, tocilizumab and steroids were used based on local guidelines. The median time to viral clearance defined by two negative PCR tests was 15 days [IQR 6-25]. Overall mortality in our cohort was 9.2 %, but ICU mortality was 65 %. COVID-19 IgG antibody serology was performed in a subset (n = 87) but 26 % of PCR positive patients (n = 23) did not develop a significant antibody response. Conclusions Our study reports a lower mortality in this patient group compared with many published series. Asymptomatic PCR positivity was present in 40 %. Rapid isolation of positive patients may have contributed to the relative lack of spread of COVID-19 within our dialysis units. The lack of antibody response in a few patients is concerning.

TI  - Minimum costs to manufacture new treatments for COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIRUS ERADICATION
AB  - Introduction: 'Repurposing' existing drugs to treat COVID-19 is vital to reducing mortality and controlling the pandemic. Several promising drugs have been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and middle-income economies.
   Methods: Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HIV amongst others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available.
   Results: Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days). Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US.
   Conclusions: Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices. Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally.

TI  - COVID-19 in older adults: Retrospective cohort study in a tertiary hospital in Japan
T2  - GERIATRICS & GERONTOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Aim We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, in particular older patients, admitted to tertiary and partner hospitals in Saitama, Japan. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to tertiary and partner hospitals in Saitama, Japan. Twenty-six patients with COVID-19 were categorized into two groups, i.e., older (>= 75 years) and younger adults (<= 74 years). We evaluated the clinical characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory test results, treatments and outcomes of the patients. Results The majority of the older patients had comorbidities, such as dementia, cardiovascular disease and bone fractures. Comorbidities were significantly more frequent in older patients than younger patients. No association was found between age and body temperature or the incidence of respiratory failure. White blood cell count was significantly lower in older patients (P= 0.018) and the decrease in lymphocytes was greater in younger patients (P= 0.009). Computed tomography (CT) of all patients showed non-segmental, peripherally dominant ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. In older patients, antiviral drugs, anticoagulants and anti-inflammatory drugs were administered on a compassionate use basis. The difference in mortality between the older and the younger patients was not statistically significant. Conclusions In older patients, typical clinical symptoms and blood test changes were often absent; however, CT always contained typical findings of COVID-19, suggesting that CT may be a useful diagnostic tool. Our report illustrates that appropriate treatment, taking patient background into consideration, may improve their condition regardless of age.Geriatr Gerontol Int center dot center dot; center dot center dot: center dot center dot-center dot center dot Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; center dot center dot: center dot center dot-center dot center dot.

TI  - SUPPLEMENTAL MEDICINES-NUTRITIONS USED BY HEALTH PERSONNEL IN THEIR OWN COVID-19 TREATMENT SCHEDULE
T2  - JOURNAL OF BASIC AND CLINICAL HEALTH SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose: In this study, with a view to investigating drug use behaviors of healthcare personnel who had Covid-19 infection in the first 1 year of the pandemic, it was aimed to determine the additional drugs and nutritional supplements they used in their own treatment.Material and Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. The data were obtained through an online survey voluntarily completed under pandemic conditions by doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and other health personnel who declared that they had Covid-19.Results: The study consisted of 405 individuals. 98% of healthcare personnels preferred to support their treatment. The medicines and herbal products that the participants started to use by their own decisions, without the advice of the physician who examined them, and the frequency of their use were vitamin C 53.3%, vitamin D 48.1%, acetylsalicylic acid 26.7%, paracetamol 23%, zinc 26.4%, multivitamin 19%, acetylcysteine 14.8%, famotidine 14.3%, subcutaneous heparin 12.6%. As for herbal products, inhaling thyme oil was noted in 11.6%, drinking thyme oil 10.1%, consuming ginger 14.3% of the participants. Non-prescription support products were found to be beneficial in 44.4%.Conclusion: Almost all of the participants took a supplement with the intention to support the treatment. The fact that one out of two participants declared that they benefited from over-the-counter supplements reveals that further studies are needed to support the rational use of over-the-counter products in the treatment of Covid-19.

TI  - Investigating the Impacts of Smoking and Exercise History on the Recovery Course among Covid-19 Patients
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL & HEALTH SCIENCES
AB  - Aim: The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of exercise and smoking history of the COVID-19 patients on their recovery course and time.
   Methods: In this respect, as the data source, we observed a total of 310 patients, 176 males 134 females, who tested positive for COVID-19, had no chronic disease, and received inpatient or outpatient treatment. The patients also filled out a personal information form covering their demographic background, including smoking and exercise history. All participants received favipiravir as the standard medication, and their symptoms and the durations of these symptoms were evaluated using the focus group interview method. We analyzed the data on SPSS 17.0 utilizing Independent T-Test, one-way ANOVA, Chi-Square, and Pearson Correlation tests.
   Results: The results revealed significant differences between former smokers and those who never smoked and quitted smoking by recovery time (p<0.01). There were also significant differences between those doing exercises actively and those who never did or quitted exercise (p<0.01). Again, with regard to recovery time, we found significant differences between groups that quitted exercise in different periods (p<0.05) and between those with different weights (p<0.05). In addition, we reached smoking cessation time and exercise history had positive relationships with recovery time.
   Conclusion: Considering the results, we concluded that non-smoking and exercise had a positive impact on avoiding adverse effects of the COVID-19 disease.

TI  - Combination of (interferon beta-1b, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin) versus favipiravir in hospitalized patients with non-critical COVID-19: A cohort study
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Objectives Our study aims at comparing the efficacy and safety of IFN-based therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon beta -1b) vs. favipiravir (FPV) in a cohort of hospitalized patients with non-critical COVID-19.
   Methods Single center observational study comparing IFN-based therapy (interferon beta -1b, ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir) vs. FPV in non-critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Allocation to either treatment group was non-random but based on changes to national treatment protocols rather than physicians' selection (quasi-experimental). We examined the association between IFN-based therapy and 28-day mortality using Cox regression model with treatment as a time-dependent covariate.
   Results The study cohort included 222 patients, of whom 68 (28%) received IFN-based therapy. Antiviral therapy was started at a median of 5 days (3-6 days) from symptoms onset in the IFN group vs. 6 days (4-7 days) for the FPV group, P <0.0001. IFN-based therapy was associated with a lower 28-day mortality as compared to FPV (6 (9%) vs. 18 (12%)), adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] (95% Cl) = 0.27 (0.08-0.88)). No difference in hospitalization duration between the 2 groups, 9 (7-14) days vs. 9 (7-13) days, P = 0.732 was found. IFN treated group required less use of systemic corticosteroids (57%) as compared to FPV (77%), P = 0.005 after adjusting for disease severity and other confounders. Patients in the IFN treated group were more likely to have nausea and diarrhea as compared to FPV group (13%) vs. (3%), P = 0.013 and (18%) vs. (3%), P<0.0001, respectively.
   Conclusion Early IFN-based triple therapy was associated with lower 28-days mortality as compared to FPV.

TI  - Signal amplification by reversible exchange for COVID-19 antiviral drug candidates
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Several drug candidates have been proposed and tested as the latest clinical treatment for coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir/lopinavir, and favipiravir are under trials for the treatment of this disease. The hyperpolarization technique has the ability to further provide a better understanding of the roles of these drugs at the molecular scale and in different applications in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance/magnetic resonance imaging. This technique may provide new opportunities in diagnosis and research of COVID-19. Signal amplification by reversible exchange-based hyperpolarization studies on large-sized drug candidates were carried out. We observed hyperpolarized proton signals from whole structures, due to the unprecedented long-distance polarization transfer by para-hydrogen. We also found that the optimal magnetic field for the maximum polarization transfer yield was dependent on the molecular structure. We can expect further research on the hyperpolarization of other important large molecules, isotope labeling, as well as polarization transfer on nuclei with a long spin relaxation time. A clinical perspective of these features on drug molecules can broaden the application of hyperpolarization techniques for therapeutic studies.

TI  - Design, Characterization and In-vitro Evaluation of Favipiravir Orodispersible Films
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Introduction: Orodispersible films (ODF) is a thin strip that is mostly transparent, biodegradable and it has hydrophilic polymers that disintegrate and dissolves immediately when getting in contact with saliva. Different disintegrants play a crucial role in film properties such as organoleptic properties, film thickness, and in particular disintegration time of the film. The main reason for the development of oral films is for their prominent role in increased patient compliance among pediatrics and geriatrics by disintegrating faster, releasing the drug rapidly, without the need for water, and mostly decreasing the risk of choking.
   Aim: To formulate orodispersible films of favipiravir and to study the effect of different superdisintegrants on various film properties.
   Methods: The method used to prepare the film is the solvent casting method. In this method, the solution is prepared using polymer, drug, and superdisintegrants. This solution is casted on a film-forming apparatus using a spreader an instrument to obtain a thin film.
   Results: The prepared oral films weights ranging from 148mg to 237mg based on the superdisintegrant concentration. The pH of the prepared films didn't vary significantly and percent moisture absorption doesn't have significant variation. However, the texture varied from smooth to rough and transparent to translucent. Disintegration time is varying from 28 to 42 seconds. The optimum batch formulation gave 98% of drug release.

TI  - Exploring the permeability of covid-19 drugs within the cellular membrane: a molecular dynamics simulation study
T2  - PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB  - The diffusion of drugs into the cellular membrane is an important step in the drug delivery systems. Furthermore, predicting the interaction and permeability of drugs across the cellular membrane could help scientists to design bioavailable and high-efficient drugs. Discovering the COVID-19 drugs has recently drawn remarkable attention to tackle its outbreak. Due to the rapid replication of the coronavirus in the human body, searching for highly permeable drugs into the cellular membrane is vital. Herein, we performed the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and density functional (DFT) calculations to investigate the permeability of keto and enol tautomers of the favipiravir (FAV) as well as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) COVID-19 drugs into the cellular membrane. Our results reveal that though both keto and enol tautomers of the FAV are feasible to transfer through the cellular membrane, the keto form moves faster and diffuses deeper; however, the HCQ molecules aggregate in the water phase and remain near the cellular membrane. It is worth pointing out that the obtained results are consistent with the reactivity trends projected by the calculated reactivity descriptors of the considered drugs. Despite the pair correlation function and H-bond analyses revealing the interactions between the membrane and HCQ, the aggregation of the HCQ molecules resists their passage through the cellular membrane. Besides, the lower free energy barrier of FAV confirms its higher permeability than HCQ. These findings suggest that due to the deeper permeability of the FAV drug, its effectiveness can be more than that of HCQ. These molecular insights might help with a better understanding of the interactions between COVID-19 drugs and cellular membranes. Moreover, these theoretical findings could help experimental researchers find high-efficient strategies for COVID-19 therapy.

TI  - Clinical characteristics, risk factors, and rate of severity of a nationwide COVID-19 Saudi cohort
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Objective: To evaluate COVID19 patients' clinical characteristics, risk factors, and COVID-19 severity at baseline and over one month following hospitalization.Design, setting, and participants: This prospective cohort study of 598 Saudi COVID19 patients recruited from 4 major medical institutions nationwide between June 01, 2020, and February 28, 2021. Patients were stratified into different demographic characteristics and COVID-19 severity scale.Results: Of the 598 hospitalized adult COVID19 patients (mean [range] age, 57 [46 to 65] years; 59% male), 300 (50.16%) had severe clinical COVID-19. Comorbidity was high among hospitalized patients (73.5 %), with diabetes mellitus (n=; 46%) and hypertension (n=; 41%) being the most common prevalent. In a multivariate logistic regression model, patient demographics and clinical factors such as age (odds ratio [OR], 1.014 per year; 95% CI, 1.003-1.025), male sex (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.02-2.62), diabetes mellitus (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.06-2.49), obesity (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.26-2.94), oxygen saturation<92% (OR, 4.83; 95% CI, 2.96-7.86), and high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (OR, 3.74 per unit; 95% CI, 1.96-7.14) were independently associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Moreover, more than 60% of male patients and middle-aged patients (40-60 years) were associated with the use of COVID-19 medications, including favipiravir and dexamethasone, during their hospital stay. Additionally, the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation was the highest in female patients (61.5%) and in middle-aged patients (46.2%). However, the death rate was slightly higher in males (56%) than in female patients and in elderly patients (52%). In Cox proportional analysis, age associated with increased risk of 60-days mortality (Hazard ratio; HR, 1.05 per year; 95% CI, 1.018-1.098). Additionally, the Riyadh region associated with more COVID-19 cases required invasive respiratory support (57.7%) and Jeddah was associated with more deceased COVID-19 cases (44%).Conclusions: The data shows that comorbidity is associated with hospitalization among COVID-19 patients, which indicates the level of severity. Infection during the winter season (November), male gender, elderly, and those with pre-existing diabetes mellitus or obesity were associated with higher COVID19 clinical severity.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

TI  - Antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs to combat COVID-19: Effects on cardiac ion channels and risk of ventricular arrhythmias
T2  - BIOIMPACTS
AB  - Introduction: Drugs with no indication for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (e.g., drugs employed to treat COVID-19) can increase the risk of arrhythmias. Of interest, a six-fold increase in the number of arrhythmic events was reported in patients with severe COVID-19. In this study, we reviewed (i) the pro-arrhythmic action of drugs given to patients with COVID-19 infection, and (ii) the effects of inflammatory cytokines on cardiac ion channels and possible generation of arrhythmias.
   Methods: We conducted a literature search on the drugs with purported or demonstrated efficacy against COVID-19 disease, emphasizing the mechanisms by which anti-COVID-19 drugs and inflammatory cytokines interfere with cardiac ion channels.
   Results: Antibiotics (azithromycin), antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine), antivirals (ritonavir/lopinavir, atazanavir), and some of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (vandetanib) could induce long QT and increase risk for ventricular arrhythmias. The pro-arrhythmic action results from drug-induced inhibition of Kv11.1 (hERG) channels interfering with the repolarizing potassium IKr currents, leading to long QT and increased risk of triggered arrhythmias. At higher concentrations, these drugs may interfere with IKs, IK1, and/or Ito potassium currents, and even inhibit sodium (INa) and calcium (ICa) currents, inducing additional cardiac toxicity. Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton's TK, increased the incidence of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia associated with a short QT interval. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha inhibit IKr and Ito repolarizing potassium currents. High levels of inflammatory cytokines could contribute to the arrhythmic events. For remdesivir, favipiravir, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, anakinra, baricitinib, and monoclonal antibodies (bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and casirivimab), no evidence supports significant effects on cardiac ion channels, changes in the QT interval, and increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias.
   Conclusion: This study supports the concept of hERG channel promiscuity. Different drug classes given to COVID-19 patients might delay repolarization, and increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The presence of comorbid pro-arrhythmic disease states, and elevated levels of pro-arrhythmic cytokines, could increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Discontinuation of nonessential drugs and correction of electrolyte abnormalities could prevent severe ventricular arrhythmias. Altogether, the most effective therapies against COVID-19 (remdesivir, dexamethasone, monoclonal antibodies) lack pro-arrhythmic activity.

T2  - 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HIGHER EDUCATION ADVANCES (HEAD'21)
CP  - 7th International Conference on Higher Education Advances (HEAd)
AB  - As the Sars-CoV2 pandemic continues to grow, researchers around the world are urgently seeking new treatments to prevent infection, cure those infected, or lessen the severity of the disease. Although there are several recently approved vaccines, clinical trials are underway to "re-use" drugs normally indicated for other diseases. This teaching experience studies the market for 8 pharmaceutical products used to fight the pandemic (remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, sofosbuvir, pyrfenidone and tocilizumab) in 13 countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, France, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Africa, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States). Through the analysis of prices and costs, we reflect on the difficulty of access to treatment according to the country.The objective is to deepen knowledge of the pharmaceutical market: (i) to demonstrate in a tangible way the differences between production costs and final prices of medicines, (ii) to perceive the difficulty of access to certain treatments depending on the country, (iii) to reflect on what initiatives should be implemented in an international emergency context such as the one we are experiencing.

TI  - Voltammetric sensor based on bimetallic nanocomposite for determination of favipiravir as an antiviral drug
T2  - MICROCHIMICA ACTA
AB  - A novel and sensitive voltammetric nanosensor was developed for the first time for trace level monitoring of favipiravir based on gold/silver core-shell nanoparticles (Au@Ag CSNPs) with conductive polymer poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and functionalized multi carbon nanotubes (F-MWCNTs) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The formation of Au@Ag CSNPs/PEDOT:PSS/F-MWCNT composite was confirmed by various analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Under the optimized conditions and at a typical working potential of + 1.23 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the Au@Ag CSNPs/PEDOT:PSS/F-MWCNT/GCE revealed linear quantitative ranges from 0.005 to 0.009 and 0.009 to 1.95 mu M with a limit of detection 0.46 nM (S/N = 3) with acceptable relative standard deviations (1.1-4.9 %) for pharmaceutical formulations, urine, and human plasma samples without applying any sample pretreatment (1.12-4.93%). The interference effect of antiviral drugs, biological compounds, and amino acids was negligible, and the sensing system demonstrated outstanding reproducibility, repeatability, stability, and reusability. The findings revealed that this assay strategy has promising applications in diagnosing FAV in clinical samples, which could be attributed to the large surface area on active sites and high conductivity of bimetallic nanocomposite.

TI  - Synergistic effect of Si-doping and Fe2O3-encapsulation on drug delivery and sensor applications of ?-graphyne nanotube toward favipiravir as an antiviral for COVID-19: A DFT study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB  - In this work, the behavior of favipiravir (FAV) adsorption on the pristine (2,2) graphyne-based gamma-nanotube (GYNT) was theoretically studied. Also, the Si-doped form (Si-GYNT) and its composite with encapsulated Fe2O3 (Fe2O3@Si-GYNT) were investigated within density functional theory (DFT) calculations, using M05 functionals and B3LYP. It was found that FAV is weakly to moderately adsorb on the bare GYNT and Si-GYNT tube, releasing the energy of 2.2 to 19.8 kcal/mol. After FAV adsorption, the bare tube's electronic properties are changed. Localized impurity is induced at the valence and conduction levels by encapsulating a tiny Fe2O3 cluster. As such, the target composite becomes a magnetic material. The binding energy between the Fe2O3@Si-GYNT and the FAV molecule becomes substantially stronger (E-ad = -25.2 kcal/mol). We developed a drug release system in target parts of body, during protonation in the low pH of injured cells, detaching the FAV from the tube surface. The drug's reaction mechanism with Fe2O3@Si-GYNT shifts from covalence in the normal environment to hydrogen bonding in an acidic matrix. The optimized structure's natural bond orbital, quantum molecular descriptors, LUMO, HOMO and energy gap were also investigated. The recovery time can be reduced to less than 10 s by increasing the working temperature properly during the experimental test.

TI  - Identification of Suitable Drug Combinations for Treating COVID-19 Using a Novel Machine Learning Approach: The RAIN Method
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary This study follows an improved approach to systematic reviews, called the Systematic Review and Artificial Intelligence Network Meta-Analysis (RAIN), registered within PROSPERO (CRD42021256797), in which, the PRISMA criterion is still considered. Drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 were searched in the databases of ScienceDirect, Web of Science (WoS), ProQuest, Embase, Medline (PubMed), and Scopus. In addition, using artificial intelligence and the measurement of the p-value between human genes affected by COVID-19 and drugs that have been suggested by clinical experts, and reported within the identified research papers, suitable drug combinations are proposed for the treatment of COVID-19. During the systematic review process, 39 studies were selected. Our analysis shows that most of the reported drugs, such as azithromycin and hydroxyl-chloroquine on their own, do not have much of an effect on the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Based on the result of the new artificial intelligence, on the other hand, at a significance level of less than 0.05, the combination of the two drugs therapeutic corticosteroid + camostat with a significance level of 0.02, remdesivir + azithromycin with a significance level of 0.03, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein + camostat with a significance level 0.02 are considered far more effective for the treatment of COVID-19 and are therefore recommended. COVID-19 affects several human genes, each with its own p-value. The combination of drugs associated with these genes with small p-values may lead to an estimation of the combined p-value between COVID-19 and some drug combinations, thereby increasing the effectiveness of these combinations in defeating the disease. Based on human genes, we introduced a new machine learning method that offers an effective drug combination with low combined p-values between them and COVID-19. This study follows an improved approach to systematic reviews, called the Systematic Review and Artificial Intelligence Network Meta-Analysis (RAIN), registered within PROSPERO (CRD42021256797), in which, the PRISMA criterion is still considered. Drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 were searched in the databases of ScienceDirect, Web of Science (WoS), ProQuest, Embase, Medline (PubMed), and Scopus.

Additionally, at a significance level of less than 0.01, the combination of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein + camostat + azithromycin + tocilizumab + oseltamivir with a significance level of 0.
   006, and the combination of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein + camostat + chloroquine + favipiravir + tocilizumab7 with corticosteroid + camostat + oseltamivir + remdesivir + tocilizumab at a significant level of 0.009 are effective in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and are also recommended. The results of this study provide sets of effective drug combinations for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. In addition, the new artificial intelligence used in the RAIN method could provide a forward-looking approach to clinical trial studies, which could also be used effectively in the treatment of diseases such as cancer.

TI  - Covid-19: The Biggest Threat of the 21st Century: In Respectful Memory of the Warriors All Over the World
T2  - TURKISH THORACIC JOURNAL
AB  - Since the first case was diagnosed in China, the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has become the number one issue in the world and it seems to remain trend-topic for a long time. Until 17 April, it affected 210 countries, infected over 2 million people and caused approximately 150000 deaths. Although the course of the disease ranges from asymptomatic state to severe ARDS; the majority of patients reveal only mild symptoms. Though adults are the most commonly affected group; it can also be seen in newborns and elderly patients. Unfortunately, elderly patients are the most vulnerable group with higher mortality. Elderly patients, smokers and patients with comorbid conditions are most affected by the disease. In certain diagnostical tool is the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) test. However, it can be resulted in false-negative results and in this case the computed thorax tomography (CT) is one of the most important tools with high sensitivity. Besides the supportive treatment, most commonly used agents are immunomodulatory drugs such as plaquenil and azitromycin, and anti-virals including oseltamivir, ritonavir-lopinavir, favipiravir. Until a vaccine or a specific therapy invented, the most important intervention to control the disease is to fight against transmission. This is a real war and the doctors are the soldiers.

TI  - Comparative assessment of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors under clinical trials to control SARS-CoV2 using rigorous computational workflow
T2  - RSC ADVANCES
AB  - The devastating effect of SARS-CoV2 continues and the scientific community is pursuing to find the strategy to combat the spread of the virus. The approach is adapted to target this virus with medicine in combination with existing vaccines. For this, the medications that can specifically inhibit an enzyme essential for viral replication 'RNA-dependant-RNA polymerase (RdRp)' of SARS-CoV2 are being developed. RdRp is the enzyme commonly found in all RNA viruses but is absent in humans. There are in total 60 different RdRp inhibitors already under clinical trials for combating other RNA viruses, which are sought to even work for SARS-CoV2. These inhibitors are classified as nucleoside/nucleotide analogues and nonnucleoside/nonnucleotide analogues. In this study, all the known RdRp inhibitors were computationally targeted in the native form and their active form making the use of molecular docking, MM-GBSA and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to find the top two of each nucleoside/nucleotide analogues and nonnucleoside/nonnucleotide analogues. The results showed ribavirin 5 '-triphosphate and favipiravir ribonucleoside triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP) to be the top two nucleotide analogues while pimodivir and dihydropyrazolopyridinone analogue 8d were the top two nonnucleosides/non-nucleotide analogues.

TI  - Electrochemical Sensing of Favipiravir with an Innovative Water-Dispersible Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Based on the Bimetallic Metal-Organic Framework: Comparison of Morphological Effects
T2  - BIOSENSORS-BASEL
AB  - Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are widely used as modifiers in electrochemical sensors due to their high sensitivity and promise of inexpensive mass manufacturing. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel MIP-sensor that can measure the electrochemical activity of favipiravir (FAV) as an antiviral drug, thereby enabling quantification of the concentration of FAV in biological and river water samples and in real-time. MOF nanoparticles' application with various shapes to determine FAV at nanomolar concentrations was described. Two different MOF nanoparticle shapes (dodecahedron and sheets) were systematically compared to evaluate the electrochemical performance of FAV. After carefully examining two different morphologies of MIP-Co-Ni@MOF, the nanosheet form showed a higher performance and efficiency than the nanododecahedron. When MIP-Co/Ni@MOF-based and NIP-Co/Ni@MOF electrodes (nanosheets) were used instead, the minimum target concentrations detected were 7.5 x 10(-11) (MIP-Co-Ni@MOF) and 8.17 x 10(-9) M (NIP-Co-Ni@MOF), respectively. This is a significant improvement (>10(2)), which is assigned to the large active surface area and high fraction of surface atoms, increasing the amount of greater analyte adsorption during binding. Therefore, water-dispersible MIP-Co-Ni@MOF nanosheets were successfully applied for trace-level determination of FAV in biological and water samples. Our findings seem to provide useful guidance in the molecularly imprinted polymer design of MOF-based materials to help establish quantitative rules in designing MOF-based sensors for point of care (POC) systems.

TI  - Anti-Inflammatory Properties of Drugs Used to Control COVID-19 and their Effects on the Renin-Angiotensin System and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB  - COVID-19 infection is associated with systemic inflammation, and sometimes hyperinflammatory responses with cytokine storm. This plays a major role in COVID-19 severity and poor disease prognosis, even death. Higher levels of inflammatory hallmarks including C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimers, and cytokines such as interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-alpha) have been reported. Many anti-viral drugs have been tried, but none were proven fully effective. Supportive care and management of the complications that are caused mainly by inflammation might be the key to greater survival rates and shorter hospitalization (e.g., the use of remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, umifenovir (arbidol), oseltamivir, ganciclovir, favipiravir, darunavir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, anakinra, canakinumab, tocilizumab, siltuximab, sarilumab, Type 1 interferon, interferon beta-1 alpha, interferon alpha-2b, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, fedratinib, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone). However, the efficacy of these treatments still needs well-planned clinical trials. In such trials, careful attention must be paid to the duration of the treatment, the onset of beneficial effects, and the severity of the disease, otherwise, the outcomes may still remain inconclusive. Herein, we present a review of the current drugs, which are being used in the management of the disease and their anti-inflammatory properties. We also investigated if these drugs directly interact with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE 2), which is a crucial component of the virus entry to the cells.

TI  - A systematic review of trial registry entries for randomized clinical trials investigating COVID-19 medical prevention and treatment
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Aim To identify investigated interventions for COVID-19 prevention or treatment via trial registry entries on planned or ongoing randomised clinical trials. To assess these registry entries for recruitment status, planned trial size, blinding and reporting of mortality. Methods We identified trial registry entries systematically via the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and 33 trial registries up to June 23, 2020. We included relevant trial registry entries for randomized clinical trials investigating medical preventive, adjunct or supportive therapies and therapeutics for treatment of COVID-19. Studies with non-random and single-arm design were excluded. Trial registry entries were screened by two authors independently and data were systematically extracted. Results We included 1303 trial registry entries from 71 countries investigating 381 different single interventions. Blinding was planned in 47% of trials. Sample size was >200 participants in 40% of trials and a total of 611,364 participants were planned for inclusion. Mortality was listed as an outcome in 57% of trials. Recruitment was ongoing in 54% of trials and completed in 8%. Thirty-five percent were multicenter trials. The five most frequent investigational categories were immune modulating drugs (266 trials (20%)), unconventional medicine (167 trials (13%)), antimalarial drugs (118 trials (9%)), antiviral drugs (100 trials (8%)) and respiratory adjuncts (78 trials (6%)). The five most frequently tested uni-modal interventions were: chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (113 trials with 199,841 participants); convalescent plasma (64 trials with 11,840 participants); stem cells (51 trials with 3,370 participants); tocilizumab (19 trials with 4,139 participants) and favipiravir (19 trials with 3,210 participants). Conclusion An extraordinary number of randomized clinical trials investigating COVID-19 management have been initiated with a multitude of medical preventive, adjunctive and treatment modalities. Blinding will be used in only 47% of trials, which may have influence on future reported treatment effects. Fifty-seven percent of all trials will assess mortality as an outcome facilitating future meta-analyses.

TI  - Baloxavir Marboxil: An Original New Drug against Influenza
T2  - PHARMACEUTICALS
AB  - Baloxavir marboxil is a new drug developed in Japan by Shionogi to treat seasonal flu infection. This cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor is a prodrug that releases the biologically active baloxavir acid. This new medicine has been marketed in Japan, the USA and Europe. It is well tolerated (more than 1% of the patients experienced diarrhea, bronchitis, nausea, nasopharyngitis, and headache), and both influenza A and B viruses are sensitive, although the B strain is more resistant due to variations in the amino acid residues in the binding site. The drug is now in post-marketing pharmacovigilance phase, and its interest will be especially re-evaluated in the future during the annual flu outbreaks. It has been also introduced in a recent clinical trial against COVID-19 with favipiravir.

TI  - Visible Light-Promoted Green and Sustainable Approach for One- Pot Synthesis of 4,4' -(Arylmethylene)bis(1H-pyrazol-5-ols), In Vitro Anticancer Activity, and Molecular Docking with Covid-19 M-pro
T2  - ACS OMEGA
AB  - A visible light-promoted, efficient, green, and sustainable strategy has been adopted to unlatch a new pathway toward the synthesis of a library of medicinally important 4,4'-(arylmethylene)bis(1H-pyrazol-5-ols) moieties using substituted aromatic aldehydes and sterically hindered 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazoline-5-one in excellent yield. This reaction shows high functional group tolerance and provides a cost-effective and catalyst-free protocol for the quick synthesis of biologically active compounds from readily available substrates. Synthesized compounds were characterized by spectroscopic techniques such as IR, (HNMR)-H-1, (CNMR)-C-13, and single-crystal XRD analysis. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative activities against a panel of five different human cancer cell lines and compared with Tamoxifen using MTT assay. Compound 3m exhibited maximum antiproliferative activity and was found to be more active as compared to Tamoxifen against both the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines with an IC50 of 5.45 and 9.47 mu M, respectively. A molecular docking study with respect to COVID-19 main protease (M-pro) (PDB ID: 6LU7) has also been carried out which shows comparatively high binding affinity of compounds 3f and 3g (-8.3 and -8.8 Kcal/mole, respectively) than few reported drugs such as ritonavir, remdesivir, ribacvirin, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and olsaltamivir. Hence, it reveals the possibility of these compounds to be used as effective COVID-19 inhibitors.

TI  - Cyclodextrins in the antiviral therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF DRUG DELIVERY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The main antiviral drug-cyclodextrin interactions, changes in physicochemical and physiological properties of the most commonly used virucides are summarized. The potential complexation of antiviral molecules against the SARS-Cov2 also pointed out the lack of detailed information in designing effective and general medicines against viral infections. The principal problem of the current molecules is the 3D structures of the currently active compounds. Improving the solubility or bioavailability of antiviral molecules is possible, however, there is no universal solution, and the complexation experiments dominantly use the already approved cyclodextrin derivatives. This review discusses the basic properties of the different cyclodextrin derivatives, their potential in antiviral formulations, and the prevention and treatment of viral infections. The biologically active new cyclodextrin derivatives are also discussed.

TI  - Interferon therapy in patients with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Concern regarding coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks has stayed relevant to global health in the last decades. Emerging COVID-19 infection, caused by the novel SARS-CoV2, is now a pandemic, bringing a substantial burden to human health. Interferon (IFN), combined with other antivirals and various treatments, has been used to treat and prevent MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 infections. We aimed to assess the clinical efficacy of IFN-based treatments and combinational therapy with antivirals, corticosteroids, traditional medicine, and other treatments. Major healthcare databases and grey literature were investigated. A three-stage screening was utilized, and included studies were checked against the protocol eligibility criteria. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed, followed by narrative data synthesis. Fifty-five distinct studies of SARS-CoV2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV were spotted. Our narrative synthesis showed a possible benefit in the use of IFN. A good quality cohort showed lower CRP levels in Arbidol (ARB) + IFN group vs. IFN only group. Another study reported a significantly shorter chest X-ray (CXR) resolution in IFN-Alfacon-1 + corticosteroid group compared with the corticosteroid only group in SARS-CoV patients. In a COVID-19 trial, total adverse drug events (ADEs) were much lower in the Favipiravir (FPV) + IFN-alpha group compared with the LPV/RTV arm (P = 0.001). Also, nausea in patients receiving FPV + IFN-alpha regimen was significantly lower (P = 0.03). Quantitative analysis of mortality did not show a conclusive effect for IFN/RBV treatment in six moderately heterogeneous MERS-CoV studies (log OR = -0.05, 95% CI: (-0.71,0.62), I-2 = 44.71%). A meta-analysis of three COVID-19 studies did not show a conclusive nor meaningful relation between receiving IFN and COVID-19 severity (log OR = -0.44, 95% CI: (-1.13,0.25), I-2 = 31.42%). A lack of high-quality cohorts and controlled trials was observed. Evidence suggests the potential efficacy of several combination IFN therapies such as lower ADEs, quicker resolution of CXR, or a decrease in inflammatory cytokines; Still, these options must possibly be further explored before being recommended in public guidelines. For all major CoVs, our results may indicate a lack of a definitive effect of IFN treatment on mortality. We recommend such therapeutics be administered with extreme caution until further investigation uncovers high-quality evidence in favor of IFN or combination therapy with IFN.

TI  - Drug designing against NSP15 of SARS-COV2 via high throughput computational screening and structural dynamics approach
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The rapid outbreak of the COVID-19 also known as SARS-CoV2 has been declared pandemic with serious global concern. As there is no effective therapeutic against COVID-19, there is an urgent need for explicit treatment against it. The focused objective of the current study is to propose promising drug candidates against the newly identified potential therapeutic target (endonuclease, NSP15) of SARS-CoV2. NSP15 is an attractive druggable target due to its critical role in SARS-CoV2 replication and virulence in addition to interference with the host immune system. Here in the present study, we integrated the high throughput computational screening and dynamic simulation approach to identify the most promising candidate lead compound against NSP15.5-fluoro-2-oxo-1H-pyrazine-3-carboxamide (favipiravir), (3R,4R, 5R)-3,4-Bis(benzyloxy)-5-((benzyloxy) methyl) dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one) remedesivir, 1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl N-[(2S,3S, 5S)-3-hydroxy-54[(2 S)-3-methyl-2[methyl-[(2-propan-2-yl-1,3 thiazol-4-yemethyl]carbamoyl]amino]butanoyl]amino]-1,6-diphenylhexan-2-yl]-carbamate (ritonavir), ethyl (3R,4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-pentan-3-yloxycyclohexene-1-carboxylate (oseltamivir), and (2 S)-N-K2S,4S, 5S)-5-[[2 (2,6 dimethylphenoxy)acetyl]amino]-4-hydroxy-1,6-diphenyl-hexan-2-yl]-3-methyl-2-(2-oxo-1,3 diazinan-1-yl)butanamide (lopinavir) were chosen as a training set to generate the pharmacophore model. A dataset of similar to 140,000 compounds library was screened against the designed pharmacophore model and 10 unique compounds were selected that passed successfully through geometry constraints, Lipinski Rule of 5, and ADME/Tox filters along with a strong binding affinity for NSP15 binding cavity. The best fit compound was selected for dynamic simulation to have detailed structural features critical for binding with the NSP15 protein.
   Given our detailed integrative computational analysis, a Small molecule (3,3-Dimethyl-N-[4-(1-piperidinylcarbonyl) phenyl] butanamide) with drug-like properties and high binding affinity with the NSP15 is proposed as a most promising potential drug against COVID-19. The current computational integrative approach may complement high-throughput screening and the shortlisted small molecule may contribute to selective targeting of NSP15 to stop the replication of SARS-CoV2.

TI  - Is Favipiravir a Potential Therapeutic Agent in the Treatment of Intervertebral Disc Degeneration by Suppressing Autophagy and Apoptosis?
T2  - TURKISH NEUROSURGERY
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effects of favipiravir (FVP) on cell viability and cytotoxicity in human degenerated primary intervertebral disc (IVD) tissue cell cultures. Furthermore, the protein expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), nuclear factor-kappa-b (NF-kappa B), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) were also examined.
   MATERIAL and METHODS: Untreated cell cultures served as the control group, named group 1. Cell cultures treated with FVP served as the study group, named group 2. Pharmacomolecular analyses were performed in all groups at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours (h). Obtained data were evaluated statistically.
   RESULTS: Cell proliferation was suppressed in the FVP-treated samples compared to the control group samples at 24 and 72 h, and this was statistically significant (p<0.05). Decreased or increased protein expression levels of HIF-1 alpha, NF-kappa B, and IL-1 beta in FVP-treated samples may be an indication of suppression in anabolic events as well as proliferation in IVD cultures. FVP administration showed that AF/NP cells in a culture medium may induce a strong inflammatory response to FVP. This strong inflammatory response is likely to cause slowed proliferation. It may also be a trigger for many catabolic events. NF-kappa B expression increased within the first 24 h and then decreased rapidly. Based on the data obtained, it may be suggested that the rapidly increasing NF-kB may have stimulated the expression of many antiproliferative genes.
   CONCLUSION: The suppression of IL-1 beta and NF-kB protein expressions in IVD cells treated with FVP is important in the treatment of IVD degeneration (IDD). If the protein expression of HIF-1 alpha could be increased along with the suppression of IL-1 beta and NF-kB, FVP would perhaps be a promising pharmacological agent in the treatment of IDD.

TI  - Phenolic and flavonoid contents in Malva sylvestris and exploration of active drugs as antioxidant and anti-COVID19 by quantum chemical and molecular docking studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF SAUDI CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB  - The exploration of natural sources of antioxidant phytochemicals for human use with little toxicity gained worldwide attention. The preliminary screening of Malva sylvestris extracts revealed that its phytochemicals such as polyphenols, flavonoids and tannins, have high therapeutic potential. The total phenolic/flavonoids compounds of Malva sylvestris were extracted and isolated using bioassay guidelines, as well as in-silico studies. The extracts radical scavenging activity was further investigated using 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and nitric oxide (NO) radical bioas-says. The antioxidant potentials of various fractions were compared to standard antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and quercetin. The dichloromethane extracts of Malva sylvestris exhibited the antiradical activity against DPPH and NO with radical scavenging activities (RSA) of 88.52 and 91.05% with IC50 values 22.11 and 19.01 mu g/mL respectively. Bio guided isolation form the dichloromethane sub fractions that afforded twelve phytochemicals. Furthermore, the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO), several molecular descriptors, electron affinity, ionization potential and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) have been discussed to probe the active sites of various phytochemicals. A systematic study of isolated drugs was conducted, as well as docking, frontier molecular orbitals energies, active sites and molecular descriptors were compared with drugs currently used against COVID19 namely, dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and remdesivir. For the first time, through molecular docking approach, the inhibitions of these plant phytochemicals with NADPH were recorded to show antioxidant behavior and to explore anti-SARS-CoV-2 using core protease (6LU7) protein.

TI  - Ambroxol: Insight into the Crystal Structure, Hirshfeld Surface Analysis and Computational Study
T2  - POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC COMPOUNDS
AB  - We report detailed studies of Form II of ambroxol, which crystal packing was examined in detail by a Hirshfeld surface analysis. Molecules in the crystal structure are primarily linked through the N-H center dot center dot center dot N and O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds and C-Br center dot center dot center dot pi interactions. The Hirshfeld molecular surface is characterized by intermolecular contacts H center dot center dot center dot X (X = H, C, N, O, Br) and C/O/Br center dot center dot center dot Br. The overall topology of the energy distributions in the crystal structure of Form II of ambroxol was also established. The structure is mainly characterized by the dispersion interactions. The title compound was further studied by IR and UV-vis spectroscopy. Intermolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot N and O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds dictate the clearly revealed discrepancies between the experimental and calculated IR spectra in the region of 3000-4000 cm(-1). The DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) calculations were performed to verify the structure of Form II of ambroxol as well as its electronic and optical properties. Molecular docking was applied to examine the influence of ambroxol on a series of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The molecule of ambroxol interacts much more efficiently with a series of studied proteins in comparison to Favipiravir, showing the best binding affinity with RdRp-RNA and nsp14 (N7-MTase).

TI  - Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome and Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage in the Era of COVID-19
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) can occur after infection with Hantavirus which can occur by inhaling aerosolized rodent urine, feces, and saliva contaminated with the virus. It presents with the rapid development of pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and cardiogenic shock with the hallmark being microvascular leakage. We report a patient with a history of alcohol abuse and recent exposure to mice and sick kittens who presented with cough with sputum production, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and new-onset lower extremity edema. Imaging revealed bilateral infiltrates more common on the left with an unremarkable echocardiogram. Testing for COVID-19, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), influenza, bacterial pneumonia including tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, Blastomyces, and Coccidiodes was negative. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and were negative for acid-fast bacilli and Nocardia cultures. He was further tested for Hantavirus, Q fever, leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, and empiric treatment with doxycycline initiated. His Hantavirus IgM antibody came back positive. Human Hantavirus infection occurs after inhalation of infected rodent excreta; fortunately, human-to-human transmission has not been documented. HCPS most commonly occurs due to the Sin Nombre virus (SNV), has a case fatality rate of 50%, and is a notifiable disease in the United States. It has 3 distinct phases, prodromal, cardiopulmonary, and convalescent/recovery. The cardiopulmonary phase occurs from increased permeability of pulmonary capillaries and in severe cases can progress to cardiogenic shock. Diagnosis is based on the presence of IgM and IgG Hantavirus antibodies. Treatment is mainly supportive; however, patients are usually treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics while workup is underway. In animal models, ribavirin and favipiravir are only effective when administered in the prodromal phase. If suspicion of Hantavirus infection exists, early mobilization to the intensive care unit for treatment is recommended. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been suggested to improve outcomes in severe HCPS with refractory shock.

TI  - THE COMPUTATIONAL INVESTIGATION OF SIXTEEN ANTIVIRAL DRUGS AGAINST MAIN PROTEASE (M-PRO) AND SPIKE PROTEASE (S-PRO) OF SARS-CoV-2
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE CHILEAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB  - In this research, the fourteen commonly used antiviral drugs were investigated through the computational tools against CoV-19 or SARS-2, as well as two small bioactive molecules from the cannabis plant, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabinol (CBN). Thus, these were selelcted for molecular docking against main protein (5r7y) and spike protein (6xs6) of coronavirus. It was illustrated that the binding energies of Mpro for Pimodivir, Baloxavir Marboxil, Lopinavir, Baricitinib, Remdesivir, THC, Darunavir, Galidesivir, Nitazoxanide, CBN, Ritonavir, Penciclovir, Ribavirin, Favipiravir, Umifenovir, and Chloroquine were-8.6,-7.7,-7.6,-7.5,-7.3,-6.8,-6.6,-6.6,-6.6,-6.5,-6.5,-6.3,-6.2,-6.0,-5.7 and-5.4 kcal/mol, respectively, which could be supported for good binding molecules against micropathogens, where it was-9.8,-6.9,-6.9,-7.1,-7.1,-7.1,-7.5,-6.0,-6.2,-7.4,-5.8,-5.9,-5.7,-5.6 and-5.4 kcal/mol, respectively, for Spro. Among these, Pimodivir is a best-bonded molecule with Mpro and Spro in view of molecular docking score. Secondly, the ligand interaction was accounted for this protein against required corona virus protein consisting of weak H bonding, hydrophobic bond and Van dar Waal interaction. For justification of molecular docking, the molecular dynamics was calculated for top six scored drugs where the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) were showed that the six drugs for both main protein and spike protein. Additionally, the chemical hardness and softness have calculated, and the lowest value of softness has found in sample 06 and 13 around 0.24. The HOMO-LUMO gap has calculated with a different value for all, but the lowest value has obtained for 01. Finally, the pharmacokinetics and Lipisinki rule were calculated, and all of these molecules had satisfied the Lipisinki rule. Finally, using the admetsar online data base, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity have calculated.

TI  - Population Disequilibrium as Promoter of Adaptive Explorations in Hepatitis C Virus
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Replication of RNA viruses is characterized by exploration of sequence space which facilitates their adaptation to changing environments. It is generally accepted that such exploration takes place mainly in response to positive selection, and that further diversification is boosted by modifications of virus population size, particularly bottleneck events. Our recent results with hepatitis C virus (HCV) have shown that the expansion in sequence space of a viral clone continues despite prolonged replication in a stable cell culture environment. Diagnosis of the expansion was based on the quantification of diversity indices, the occurrence of intra-population mutational waves (variations in mutant frequencies), and greater individual residue variations in mutant spectra than those anticipated from sequence alignments in data banks. In the present report, we review our previous results, and show additionally that mutational waves in amplicons from the NS5A-NS5B-coding region are equally prominent during HCV passage in the absence or presence of the mutagenic nucleotide analogues favipiravir or ribavirin. In addition, by extending our previous analysis to amplicons of the NS3- and NS5A-coding region, we provide further evidence of the incongruence between amino acid conservation scores in mutant spectra from infected patients and in the Los Alamos National Laboratory HCV data banks. We hypothesize that these observations have as a common origin a permanent state of HCV population disequilibrium even upon extensive viral replication in the absence of external selective constraints or changes in population size. Such a persistent disequilibrium-revealed by the changing composition of the mutant spectrum-may facilitate finding alternative mutational pathways for HCV antiviral resistance. The possible significance of our model for other genetically variable viruses is discussed.

TI  - Inhibition effects of eight anti-coronavirus drugs on glycosides metabolism and glycosidases in human gut microflora
T2  - PHARMAZIE
AB  - The effects of eight oral anti-coronavirus drugs (lopinavir, ritonavir, chloroquine, darunavir, ribavirin, arbidol, favipiravir, oseltamivir) on the metabolism of four specific glycosides (polydatin, geniposide, quercitrin, glycyrrhizin) and on the activities of three major glycosidases (beta-glucosidase, alpha-rhamnosidase, beta-glucuronidase) from gut microflora were explored in vitro and determined by LC-MS/MS. The metabolism of polydatin, geniposide, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin was significantly inhibited by one or several anti-coronavirus drugs of 100 mu M around 1 h and 4 h (P<0.05), among which darunavir could strongly reduce the production of genipin (70.6% reduction), quercitin (80.6% reduction) and glycyrrhetinic acid (37.9% reduction), which may cause a high risk of herb-drug interactions (HDI). Additionally, chloroquine reduced the production of genipin and quercitin by more than 75% (P<0.05), whereas arbidol had no significant influence on the metabolism of polydatin, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin (P>0.05) so that its risk may be lower. The inhibition of darunavir on beta-glucosidase was relatively strong (IC50 = 193 +/- 23 mu M), and the inhibition became weaker on beta-glucuronidase and alpha-rhamnosidase (IC50>500 mu M). The consistency between gut microflora and glycosidase system indicated that the inhibition of darunavir on the activity of beta-glucosidase and beta-glucuronidase may be the main reason for affecting the metabolism of geniposide, glycyrrhizin and polydatin in gut microflora. However, for the inhibition of darunavir and chloroquine on the metabolism of quercetrin, there was no correlation between gut microflora and a-rhamnosidase system. Assessing the risk of HDI mediated by glycosidases in gut microflora may be conducive to the safety and efficacy of combining traditional herbal and Western medicine for the treatment of patients with Covid-19.

TI  - Drug Repurposing: A Strategy for Discovering Inhibitors against Emerging Viral Infections
T2  - CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Background: Viral diseases are responsible for several deaths around the world. Over the past few years, the world has seen several outbreaks caused by viral diseases that, for a long time, seemed to possess no risk. These are diseases that have been forgotten for a long time and, until nowadays, there are no approved drugs or vaccines, leading the pharmaceutical industry and several research groups to run out of time in the search for new pharmacological treatments or prevention methods. In this context, drug repurposing proves to be a fast and economically viable technique, considering the fact that it uses drugs that have a well-established safety profile. Thus, in this review, we present the main advances in drug repurposing and their benefit for searching new treatments against emerging viral diseases. Methods: We conducted a search in the bibliographic databases (Science Direct, Bentham Science, PubMed, Springer, ACS Publisher, Wiley, and NIH's COVID-19 Portfolio) using the keywords & quot;drug repurposing & quot;, & quot;emerging viral infections & quot; and each of the diseases reported here (CoV; ZIKV; DENV; CHIKV; EBOV and MARV) as an inclusion/exclusion criterion. A subjective analysis was performed regarding the quality of the works for inclusion in this manuscript. Thus, the selected works were those that presented drugs repositioned against the emerging viral diseases presented here by means of computational, high-throughput screening or phenotype-based strategies, with no time limit and of relevant scientific value. Results: 291 papers were selected, 24 of which were CHIKV; 52 for ZIKV; 43 for DENV; 35 for EBOV; 10 for MARV; and 56 for CoV and the rest (72 papers) related to the drugs repurposing and emerging viral diseases. Among CoV-related articles, most were published in 2020 (31 papers), updating the current topic. Besides, between the years 2003 2005, 10 articles were created, and from 2011-2015, there were 7 articles, portraying the outbreaks that occurred at that time. For ZIKV, similar to CoV, most publications were during the period of outbreaks between the years 2016 2017 (23 articles). Similarly, most CHIKV (13 papers) and DENV (14 papers) publications occur at the same time interval. For EBOV (13 papers) and MARV (4 papers), they were between the years 2015 2016. Through this review, several drugs were highlighted that can be evolved in vivo and clinical trials as possible used against these pathogens showed that remdesivir represent potential treatments against CoV. Furthermore, ribavirin may also be a potential treatment against CHIKV; sofosbuvir against ZIKV; celgosivir against DENV, and favipiravir against EBOV and MARV, representing new hopes against these pathogens. Conclusion: The conclusions of this review manuscript show the potential of the drug repurposing strategy in the discovery of new pharmaceutical products, as from this approach, drugs could be used against emerging viral diseases. Thus, this strategy deserves more attention among research groups and is a promising approach to the discovery of new drugs against emerging viral diseases and also other diseases.
