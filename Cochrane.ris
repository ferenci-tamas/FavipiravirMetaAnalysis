N2  -  INTRODUCTION: Several clinical studies have reported the efficacy of favipiravir in reducing viral load and shortening the duration of symptoms. However, the viability of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the context of favipiravir therapy and the potential for resistance development is unclear. METHODS: We sequenced SARS‐CoV‐2 in nasopharyngeal specimens collected from patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial of favipiravir at hospitals across Japan between March and May 2020. Paired genomes were sequenced from those who remained RT‐PCR‐positive 5‐8 days into favipiravir therapy. Daily nasopharyngeal specimens from 69 patients who were RT‐PCR‐positive at randomization were examined for a cytopathic effect (CPE). RESULTS: Some strains early in the trial belonged to clade 19 B, whereas the majority belonged to clade 20 B. The median time from the disease onset to negative CPE was 9 days. CPE was strongly correlated with the time from disease onset, viral load, age, and male sex. Among 23 patients for whom paired genomes were available, all except one had identical genomes. Two mutations were observed in one patient who received favipiravir, neither in the RdRp gene. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS‐CoV‐2 genome distribution in this clinical trial conducted in Japan reflected the early influx of strains from China followed by replacement by strains from Europe. CPE was significantly associated with age, male sex, and viral loads but not with favipiravir therapy. There was no evidence of resistance development during favipiravir therapy.

N2  -  Favipiravir has antiviral activity against influenza, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus and against flaviviruses. The objective of this pilot study was to compare three arms: favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; standard care (no specific SARS‐CoV‐2 treatment) only, in symptomatic patients infected by SARS‐CoV‐2 in an open‐labelled randomized clinical trial. The trial was registered with Bahrain National Taskforce for Combatting COVID‐19 on the 7th of May 2020 (registration code: NCT04387760). 150 symptomatic patients with COVID‐19 disease were randomized into one of three arms: favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, or standard care only. The primary outcome was the clinical scale at the end of study follow up (day 14 or on discharge/death) based on a points scale. The secondary outcomes were viral clearance, biochemical parameter changes and mortality at 30‐days. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. The proportion of patients who achieved a clinical scale?<?2 did not differ between groups. The favipiravir‐treated and hydroxychloroquine‐treated group showed increased viral clearance (OR, 95%CI 2.38, 0.83‐6.78, OR, 95%CI 2.15, 0.78‐5.92, respectively) compared to standard care, but this was not significant. The biochemical profile did not differ between groups, except for the platelet count (P?<?0.03) and uric acid (P?<?0.004) that were higher with favipiravir‐treatment. Primary or secondary outcome measures did not differ between favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, and standard therapy for mild to moderate COVID‐19 disease; therefore, whilst favipiravir therapy appeared safe with a trend to increased viral clearance, there was no superior therapeutic utility.Clinical trials registration. NCT04387760. Registration date: 07/05/2020.

N2  -  Favipiravir (FVP), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV), and interferon‐beta (INF‐beta) are considered as potential treatments for COVID‐19. We examined the efficacy and safety of FVP and INF‐beta compared to LPV/RTV and INF‐beta combinations for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2. It was a single‐center randomized clinical trial. Eligible patients were randomized to receive FVP plus INF‐beta versus LPV/RTV plus INF‐beta. The primary endpoint was the viral clearance after seven days of randomization. ICU admission, length of stay (LOS) in hospital, in‐hospital mortality, and the incidence of adverse events were also measured. This trial was registered on the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20200506047323N3). Patients were randomly allocated to the FVP (n = 33) and LPV/RTV (n = 33) groups. The viral clearance on Day seven was not significantly different between the FVP (31.1%) and the LPV/RTV groups (16.1%). The rate of ICU admission and likewise the in‐hospital mortality in the FVP group (12.5% and 6.3%, respectively) were similar to the LPV/RTV groups (19.4% and 19.4%, respectively). The median LOS in the hospital was also not different (6.8 days [interquartile range; IQR = 5.0–11.0] in the FVP and (8.0 days [IQR = 5.5–12.5]) in LPV/RTV groups (p = 0.140). Adverse events were observed in 25.0% of FVP and 32.3% of LPV/RTV groups. The combination therapy with FVP did not exert a higher efficacy compared to the combination regimen of LPV/RTV. However, both treatment regimens demonstrated a mild profile of adverse events.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of favipiravir combined with inhaled interferon beta‐1b in adult patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID‐19 pneumonia. METHODS: A randomized, open‐label controlled trial of oral favipiravir in adults hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID‐19 pneumonia from June 22nd 2020 to August 13th 2020 was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a combination of favipiravir with interferon beta‐1b by inhalation aerosol or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The outcome endpoints included improvement in inflammatory markers, lower length of hospital stay (LOS), discharges and lower overall 14‐day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients underwent randomization with 49% (n = 44) assigned to favipiravir and 51% (n = 45) assigned HCQ. The overall mean age was 55 ± 14 years and 58% (n = 52) were males. There were no significant differences in the inflammatory biomarkers at hospital discharge between the two groups; C‐reactive protein (p =  0.413), ferritin (p =  0.968), lactate dehydrogenase (p =  0.259) and interleukin 6 (p =  0.410). There were also no significant differences between the two groups with regards to the overall LOS (7 vs 7 days; p =  0.948), transfers to the ICU (18.2% vs 17.8%; p =  0.960), discharges (65.9% vs 68.9%; p =  0.764) and overall mortality (11.4% vs 13.3%; p =  0.778). CONCLUSIONS: No differences in clinical outcomes were found between favipiravir plus inhaled interferon beta‐1b and hydroxychloroquine in adults hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID‐19 pneumonia.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics and treatment of patients who tested positive for COVID‐19 after recovery remained elusive. Effective antiviral therapy is important for tackling these patients. We assessed the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for treating these patients. METHODS: This is a multicenter, open‐label, randomized controlled trial in SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA re‐positive patients. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either favipiravir, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary outcome was time to achieve a consecutive twice (at intervals of more than 24 h) negative RT‐PCR result for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab and sputum sample. RESULTS: Between March 27 and May 9, 2020, 55 patients underwent randomization; 36 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 19 were assigned to the control group. Favipiravir group had a significantly shorter time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab and sputum than control group (median 17 vs. 26 days); hazard ratio 2.1 (95% CI [1.1‐4.0], p = 0.038). The proportion of virus shedding in favipiravir group was higher than control group (80.6% [29/36] vs. 52.6% [10/19], p = 0.030, respectively). C‐reactive protein decreased significantly after treatment in the favipiravir group (p = 0.016). The adverse events were generally mild and self‐limiting. CONCLUSION: Favipiravir was safe and superior to control in shortening the duration of viral shedding in SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA recurrent positive after discharge. However, a larger scale and randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial is required to confirm our conclusion.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether favipiravir reduces the time to viral clearance as documented by negative RT‐PCR results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in mild cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) compared to placebo. METHODS: In this randomized, double‐blinded, multicentre, and placebo‐controlled trial, adults with PCR‐confirmed mild COVID‐19 were recruited in an outpatient setting at seven medical facilities across Saudi Arabia. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either favipiravir 1800 mg by mouth twice daily on day 1 followed by 800 mg twice daily (n = 112) or a matching placebo (n = 119) for a total of 5 to 7 days. The primary outcome was the effect of favipiravir on reducing the time to viral clearance (by PCR test) within 15 days of starting the treatment compared to the placebo group. The trial included the following secondary outcomes: symptom resolution, hospitalization, intensive care unit admissions, adverse events, and 28‐day mortality. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty‐one patients were randomized and began the study (median age, 37 years; interquartile range (IQR): 32‐44 years; 155 [67%] male), and 112 (48.5%) were assigned to the treatment group and 119 (51.5%) into the placebo group. The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrolment because of futility at the interim analysis. The median time to viral clearance was 10 days (IQR: 6‐12 days) in the favipiravir group and 8 days (IQR: 6‐12 days) in the placebo group, with a hazard ratio of 0.87 for the favipiravir group (95% CI 0.571‐1.326; p = 0.51). The median time to clinical recovery was 7 days (IQR: 4‐11 days) in the favipiravir group and 7 days (IQR: 5‐10 days) in the placebo group. There was no difference between the two groups in the secondary outcome of hospital admission. There were no drug‐related severe adverse events. CONCLUSION: In this clinical trial, favipiravir therapy in mild COVID‐19 patients did not reduce the time to viral clearance within 15 days of starting the treatment.

N2  -  Background: We examined the safety and efficacy of a treatment protocol containing Favipiravir for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2. Methods: We did a multicenter randomized open‐labeled clinical trial on moderate to severe cases infections of SARS‐CoV‐2. Patients with typical ground glass appearance on chest computerized tomography scan (CT scan) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of less than 93% were enrolled. They were randomly allocated into Favipiravir (1.6 gr loading, 1.8 gr daily) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (800/200 mg daily) treatment regimens in addition to standard care. In‐hospital mortality, ICU admission, intubation, time to clinical recovery, changes in daily SpO2 after 5 min discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, and length of hospital stay were quantified and compared in the two groups. Results: 380 patients were randomly allocated into Favipiravir (1 9 3) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (1 8 7) groups in 13 centers. The number of deaths, intubations, and ICU admissions were not significantly different (26, 27, 31 and 21, 17, 25 respectively). Mean hospital stay was also not different (7.9 days [SD = 6] in the Favipiravir and 8.1 [SD = 6.5] days in Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups) (p = 0.61). Time to clinical recovery in the Favipiravir group was similar to Lopinavir/Ritonavir group (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 – 1.17) and likewise the changes in the daily SpO2 after discontinuation of supplemental oxygen (p = 0.46) Conclusion: Adding Favipiravir to the treatment protocol did not reduce the number of ICU admissions or intubations or In‐hospital mortality compared to Lopinavir/Ritonavir regimen. It also did not shorten time to clinical recovery and length of hospital stay.

N2  -  Coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19) pandemic, caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, has gradually spread worldwide, becoming a major public health event. This situation requires designing a novel antiviral agent against the SARS‐CoV‐2; however, this is time‐consuming and the use of repurposed medicines may be promising. One such medicine is favipiravir, primarily introduced as an anti‐influenza agent in east world. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in comparison with lopinavir‐ritonavir in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In this randomized clinical trial, 62 patients were recruited. These patients had bilateral pulmonary infiltration with peripheral oxygen saturation lower than 93%. The median time from symptoms onset to intervention initiation was seven days. Favipiravir was not available in the Iranian pharmaceutical market, and it was decided to formulate it at the research laboratory of School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. The patients received favipiravir tablet at a dose of 1600 mg orally twice a day for day one and then 600 mg orally twice a day for days 2 to 6. In the second group, the patients received lopinavir‐ritonavir combination tablet at a dose of 200/50 mg twice a day for seven days. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were improved significantly in favipiravir group in comparison with lopinavir‐ritonavir group on days four and five. Mortality rate and ICU stay in both groups were similar, and there was no significant difference in this regard (P = 0.463 and P = 0.286, respectively). Chest X‐ray improvement also was not significantly different between the two groups. Adverse drug reactions occurred in both groups, and impaired liver enzymes were the most frequent adverse effect. In conclusion, early administration of oral favipiravir may reduce the duration of clinical signs and symptoms in patients with COVID‐19 and hospitalization period. The mortality rate also should be investigated in future clinical trials.

N2  -  Introduction: Since the beginning of the Coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, scientists have studied many drugs to treat it, but none of them have been approved as a complete cure. Favipiravir is one of those drugs that effectively clears the body from the virus by interfering with the process of replication. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of favipiravir compared with supportive medication to treat moderate COVID‐19 patients. Materials and Methods: In this randomized, open‐label, controlled clinical trial, we examined the efficacy of favipiravir to treat moderate COVID‐19 patients. The study was conducted in Labbafinejad Hospital (Tehran, Iran) from April to September 2021. A 1:1 ratio of eligible patients were assigned to the intervention and control groups. The control group received supportive medication. In addition to supportive medication, the intervention group received favipiravir. The primary endpoint was the hospitalization rate during the seven‐day follow‐up. And the secondary endpoints were symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests of the patients. Results: Out of 78 patients who were included in the study, 40 patients were assigned to the control group and 38 patients were assigned to the intervention group. At the beginning of treatment, the respiratory rate was higher in the intervention group (p=0.001), however, on the fifth (p=0.001) and seventh (p<0.001) days, it was significantly lower in the intervention group. In addition, oxygen saturation at the beginning of treatment was lower in the intervention group (p<0.001); however, on the fifth (p=0.016) and seventh (p<0.001) days, it was significantly higher in the intervention group. Furthermore, the consumption of favipiravir was not associated with the hospitalization rate (p=0.200). Conclusion: Favipiravir enhances respiratory manifestations in patients with moderate COVID‐19 when compared to supportive medication alone.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Early antiviral treatment is effective for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) but currently available agents are expensive. Favipiravir is routinely used in many countries, but efficacy is unproven. Antiviral combinations have not been systematically studied. We aimed to evaluate the effect of favipiravir, lopinavir‐ritonavir or the combination of both agents on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) viral load trajectory when administered early. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a Phase 2, proof of principle, randomised, placebo‐controlled, 2 × 2 factorial, double‐blind trial of ambulatory outpatients with early COVID‐19 (within 7 days of symptom onset) at 2 sites in the United Kingdom. Participants were randomised using a centralised online process to receive: favipiravir (1,800 mg twice daily on Day 1 followed by 400 mg 4 times daily on Days 2 to 7) plus lopinavir‐ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily on Days 2 to 7), favipiravir plus lopinavir‐ritonavir placebo, lopinavir‐ritonavir plus favipiravir placebo, or both placebos. The primary outcome was SARS‐CoV‐2 viral load at Day 5, accounting for baseline viral load. Between 6 October 2020 and 4 November 2021, we recruited 240 participants. For the favipiravir+lopinavir‐ritonavir, favipiravir+placebo, lopinavir‐ritonavir+placebo, and placebo‐only arms, we recruited 61, 59, 60, and 60 participants and analysed 55, 56, 55, and 58 participants, respectively, who provided viral load measures at Day 1 and Day 5. In the primary analysis, the mean viral load in the favipiravir+placebo arm had changed by ‐0.57 log10 (95% CI ‐1.21 to 0.07, p = 0.08) and in the lopinavir‐ritonavir+placebo arm by ‐0.18 log10 (95% CI ‐0.82 to 0.46, p = 0.58) compared to the placebo arm at Day 5. There was no significant interaction between favipiravir and lopinavir‐ritonavir (interaction coefficient term: 0.59 log10, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 1.50, p = 0.20). More participants had undetectable virus at Day 5 in the favipiravir+placebo arm compared to placebo only (46.3% versus 26.9%, odds ratio (OR): 2.47, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.65; p = 0.03). Adverse events were observed more frequently with lopinavir‐ritonavir, mainly gastrointestinal disturbance. Favipiravir drug levels were lower in the combination arm than the favipiravir monotherapy arm, possibly due to poor absorption. The major limitation was that the study population was relatively young and healthy compared to those most affected by the COVID‐19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: At the current doses, no treatment significantly reduced viral load in the primary analysis. Favipiravir requires further evaluation with consideration of dose escalation. Lopinavir‐ritonavir administration was associated with lower plasma favipiravir concentrations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04499677 EudraCT: 2020‐002106‐68.

N2  -  Introduction: There is no known specific treatment for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome‐Coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Our retrospective study evaluates the effectiveness of steroid treatment and the factors affecting treatment in patients with severe Coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) pneumonia that received favipiravir treatment. Materials and Methods: This study included patients older than 18 years with severe COVID‐19 pneumonia who received favipiravir treatment in a training and research hospital between March 1 and May 31, 2020. It retrospectively evaluated respiratory rate <30/min and/or severe respiratory distress and oxygen saturation > 90 and typical thoracic computerized tomography findings: Bilateral lobular, peripheral lesions, and the presence of ground‐glass opacities were determined as the criteria for severe pneumonia. For 82 cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 polymerase chain reaction positive, age, gender, symptoms, comorbidities, steroid use, and mortality rates were examined. Results: Eighty‐two patients with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosed with severe pneumonia were included in the study. Of these cases, 63% were males. The median patient age was 64±16.98 (21‐97, minimum‐maximum) years. The mortality in women was 23%, and the mortality in men was 30%. The correlation between gender and mortality was statistically significant (p=0.04). Advanced age, chronic renal failure, and confusion on hospital admission were associated with mortality (p=0.04, p=0.02, p=0.02, respectively). Methylprednisolone was given to 12 patients as an additional treatment. The mortality of the patients who received steroid treatment was significantly lower than those who did not (p=0.017). There was no bacterial infection in these 12 patients, who received steroid treatment and the procalcitonin level was not high. Conclusion: In confirmed COVID‐19 patients without concomitant bacterial infections, steroid treatment can lower mortality and long‐term morbidities. Similar to prospective randomized studies, our study showed that steroid use reduces mortality in patients with severe COVID‐19 pneumonia.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Despite vaccination, many remain vulnerable to COVID‐19 and its complications. Oral antivirals to prevent COVID‐19 progression are vital. Based upon perceived potency and clinical efficacy, favipiravir is widely used to treat COVID‐19. Evidence from large randomized controlled trials (RCT) is lacking. METHODS: In this multicenter double‐blinded placebo‐controlled RCT, adults with early mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐19 were 1:1 randomized to favipiravir or placebo. The study evaluated time to sustained clinical recovery (TT‐SCR), COVID‐19 progression, and cessation of viral shedding. RESULTS: Of 1187 analyzed patients across 40 centers, 83.3% were Hispanic, 89.0% unvaccinated, 70.3% SARS‐CoV‐2 seronegative, and 77.8% had risk factors for COVID‐19 progression. The median time from symptom presentation and from positive test to randomization was three and two days, respectively. There was no difference in TT‐SCR (median of 7 days for both groups; p = 0.80), COVID‐19 progression [11 patients each (1.9% vs. 1.8%); p = 0.96], time to undetectable virus [median = 6 days, 95% CI (6‐8) vs. 7 days, 95% CI (6‐9)], or in undetectable virus by end of therapy (73.4% vs. 72.3%; p = 0.94). Outcomes were consistent across the analyzed sub‐groups. Adverse events were observed in 13.8% and 14.8% of favipiravir‐treated and placebo‐treated subjects, respectively. Uric acid elevation was more frequent among favipiravir‐treated subjects (19.9% vs. 2.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir was well tolerated but lacked efficacy in TT‐SCR, progression to severe COVID‐19, or cessation of viral shedding and should not be used to treat patients with COVID‐19.

N2  -  Research in the development of new therapeutic agents with a wide spectrum of the antiviral activity and a low ability to develop resistance remains the main dimension in combating the global threat to public health. The need for a parenteral form of favipiravir was dictated by the necessity to increase the efficacy of therapy in COVID‐19 inpatients. This dosage form has expanded the possibilities of drug therapy in the inpatients, for whom a therapeutic effect acceleration and a high safety profile of the drugs used are especially important. The aim of the article is the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of a medicinal product containing favipiravir for the parenteral administration against the background of pathogenetic and symptomatic therapy, in comparison with standard therapy in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. Materials and methods. An open, randomized, multicenter comparative study was conducted in 6 research centers in the Russian Federation to evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir, a lyophilisate for the preparation of a concentrate for the infusion solution administrated to the patients hospitalized with COVID‐19. Screening procedures and randomization were completed in 217 patients, 209 of which had completed the study in accordance with the protocol. Results. Between the study groups, statistically significant differences have been found out, making it possible to consider the hypothesis of the drug Areplivir (favipiravir) superiority for the parenteral administration over the standard therapy, which included favipiravir (p. o.) and remdesivir. A comparative analysis has shown that a course of therapy with the parenteral favipiravir drug leads to a significant improvement in the condition of patients with COVID‐19, significant benefits in terms of the speed and frequency of improvement in the clinical status of patients, as well as a reduction in the hospital stay length. It has been proven that therapy with a drug containing favipiravir for the parenteral administration does not adversely affect the parameters of clinical and biochemical blood tests, urinalysis, coagulograms, vital signs and ECG, which indicates the therapy safety. The study drug is characterized by a high safety profile and tolerability. Conclusion. The versatility and resistance to mutations of RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase make it possible to consider it as the main target for combating the most common RNA viruses that cause ARVI, that determines the need further studies of favipiravir to expand the range of its indications.

N2  -  Background: Well tolerated antivirals administered early in the course of COVID‐19 infection when the viremia is highest could prevent progression to severe disease. Favipiravir inhibits SARS‐CoV‐2 viral replication in vitro with evidence of clinical benefit in open label trials. Placebo controlled studies of people with early symptomatic COVID‐19 with regular assessments of SARS‐CoV‐2 viral load can determine if it has an antiviral effect and improves clinical outcomes. Methods: People with PCR‐confirmed COVID‐19 and 5 days or less of symptoms were randomised 1:1 to favipiravir 1800 mg on day 1, then 800 mg twice daily or matched placebo for 14 days. SARS‐CoV‐2 viral load was quantitated from second daily self‐collected nose‐throat swabs while receiving study drug. The primary endpoint was time to virological cure defined as 2 successive swabs negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 by PCR and secondary outcomes were progression of disease severity, symptom resolution and safety. Findings: Between 31 July 2020 and 19 September 2021, 200 people were enrolled (199 in the community, 1 in hospital) with 190 receiving one or more doses of drug (modified intention to treat [mITT] population). There was no difference in time to virological cure (Log‐rank p=0.6 comparing Kaplan Meier curves), progression to hospitalisation (14 favipiravir, 9 placebo; p=0.38), time to symptom resolution (cough, fever, sore throat) and there were no deaths. 51 people related an adverse event that was possibly drug related, but these were evenly distributed (n=24 favipiravir, n=27 placebo). Sensitivity analyses where the definition of virological cure was changed to: a single negative PCR, exclude datapoints based on the presence or absence of human DNA in the swab, a SARS‐CoV‐2 viral load < 300 copies/mL being considered negative all demonstrated no difference between arms. Interpretation: Favipiravir does not improve the time to virological cure or clinical outcomes and shows no evidence of an antiviral effect when treating early symptomatic COVID‐19 infection. Funding: The study was supported in part by grants from the Commonwealth Bank Australia, the Lord Mayor's Charitable Foundation, Melbourne Australia and the Orloff Family Charitable Trust, Melbourne, Australia. JHM is supported by the Medical Research Future Fund, AYP, JT are supported by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.

N2  -  We investigated Favipiravir (FPV) efficacy in mild cases of COVID‐19 without pneumonia and its effects towards viral clearance, clinical condition, and risk of COVID‐19 pneumonia development. PCR‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected patients without pneumonia were enrolled (2:1) within 10 days of symptomatic onset into FPV and control arms. The former received 1800 mg FPV twice‐daily (BID) on Day 1 and 800 mg BID 5‐14 days thereafter until negative viral detection, while the latter received only supportive care. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement, defined by a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of ≤1. 62 patients (41 female) comprised the FPV arm (median age: 32 years, median BMI: 22 kg/m²) and 31 patients (19 female) comprised the control arm (median age: 28 years, median BMI: 22 kg/m²). The median time to sustained clinical improvement, by NEWS, was 2 and 14 days for FPV and control arms, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 2.77, 95% CI 1.57‐4.88, P < .001). The FPV arm also had significantly higher likelihoods of clinical improvement within 14 days after enrolment by NEWS (79% vs. 32% respectively, P < .001). 8 (12.9%) and 7 (22.6%) patients in FPV and control arms developed mild pneumonia at a median (range) of 6.5 (1‐13) and 7 (1‐13) days after treatment, respectively (P = .316). All recovered well without complications. We can conclude that early treatment of FPV in symptomatic COVID‐19 patients without pneumonia was associated with faster clinical improvement.Trial registration: Thai Clinical Trials Registry identifier: TCTR20200514001.

N2  -  Background: The novel coronavirus disease, commonly called COVID‐19, has already killed millions of lives. Our study aimed to identify a safe and right drug for the management of such globally threatened COVID‐19. Methods: This preliminary double‐blinded randomized controlled trial was done among 57 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients in the early stage of their illness. Of them, 29 patients received Favipiravir (FVP) and the remaining 28 patients received a placebo under the standard of care. Among the patients, 4 from Favipiravir (FVP) group and 3 from the placebo group were discontinued. The patients were observed regularly for a period of 10 days. Result: In our study, the FVP treated group showed accelerated viral clearance compared to the placebo‐treated group. Assessment of chest X‐ray showed remarkable improvement of pheumonia patient in group A compared to Group B. Hematological and Biochemical parameters such as total WBC count, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were examined. No significant differences in the hematological parameters such as WBC count, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in Group A and Group B patients. Liver transaminases levels were also stable in FVP treated group (average ALT ranges 39.4–46.2; AST 28.2–32.8). Conclusion: The drug Favipiravir displayed remarkable improvements in the clinical conditions and recovery of COVID‐19 patients at the early stages of their infections.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Favipiravir is an oral, RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor with in vitro activity against SARS‐CoV2. Despite limited data, favipiravir is administered to patients with COVID‐19 in several countries. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 double‐blind randomized controlled outpatient trial of favipiravir in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic adults with a positive SARS‐CoV2 RT‐PCR within 72 hours of enrollment. Participants were randomized 1: 1 to receive placebo or favipiravir (1800mg BID Day 1, 800 mg BID Days 2‐10). The primary outcome was SARS‐CoV‐2 shedding cessation in a modified intention‐to‐treat (mITT) cohort of participants with positive enrollment RT‐PCRs. Using SARS‐CoV‐2 amplicon‐based sequencing, we assessed favipiravir's impact on mutagenesis. RESULTS: From July 8, 2020 ‐ March 23, 2021, we randomized 149 participants with 116 included in the mITT cohort. The participants' mean age was 43 years (SD 12.5) and 57 (49%) were women. We found no difference in time to shedding cessation by treatment arm overall (HR 0.76 favoring placebo, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48‐1.20) or in sub‐group analyses (age, sex, high‐risk comorbidities, seropositivity or symptom duration at enrollment). We observed no difference in time to symptom resolution (initial: HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54‐1.29; sustained: HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.52‐1.45). We detected no difference in accumulation of transition mutations in the viral genome during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support favipiravir use at commonly used doses in outpatients with uncomplicated COVID‐19. Further research is needed to ascertain if higher doses of favipiravir are effective and safe for patients with COVID‐19.

N2  -  Background: The effectiveness of combination therapy for COVID‐19 pneumonia remains unclear. We evaluated favipiravir, camostat, and ciclesonide combination therapy in patients with moderate COVID‐19 pneumonia. Methods: In this open‐label phase 3 study, hospitalized adults who were positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 and had COVID‐19 pneumonia were enrolled prior to official vaccination drive in Japan. Participants were randomly assigned to favipiravir monotherapy or favipiravir + camostat + ciclesonide combination therapy. The primary outcome was the length of hospitalization due to COVID‐19 infection after study treatment. The hospitalization period was calculated from the time of admission to the time of patient discharge using the clinical management guide of COVID‐19 for front‐line healthcare workers developed by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (Version 3). Cases were registered between November 11, 2020, and May 31, 2021. Japan Registry of Clinical Trials registration: jRCTs031200196. Findings: Of 121 enrolled patients, 56 received monotherapy and 61 received combination therapy. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the groups. The median time of hospitalization was 10 days for the combination and 11 days for the monotherapy group. The median time to discharge was statistically significantly lower in the combination therapy vs monotherapy group (HR, 1·67 (95% CI 1·03–2·7; P = 0·035). The hospital discharge rate was statistically significantly higher in the combination therapy vs monotherapy group in patients with less severe COVID‐19 infections and those who were ≤60 years. There were no significant differences in clinical findings between the groups at 4, 8, 11, 15, and 29 days. Adverse events were comparable between the groups. There were two deaths, with one in each group. Interpretation: Combination oral favipiravir, camostat and, ciclesonide therapy could decrease the length of hospitalization stays without safety concerns in patients with moderate COVID‐19 pneumonia. However, lack of hard clinical primary outcome is one of the major limitations of the study. Funding: This research was supported by Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) under Grant Number 20fk0108261h0001.

N2  -  Objectives: We will evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir and interferon beta‐1a compared to lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta‐1a in patients with confirmed COVID‐19, who are moderately ill. Trial design: This is a phase 3, single‐center, randomized, open‐label, controlled trial with a parallel‐group design carried out at Shahid Mohammadi Hospital, Bandar Abbas, Iran. Participants: All patients with age ≥ 20 years admitted at the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Departments of the Shahid Mohammadi Hospital, Bandar Abbas, Iran, will be screened for the following criteria. Inclusion criteria:1.Confirmed diagnosis of infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 using polymerase chain reaction and/or antibody tests.2.Moderate COVID‐19 pneumonia (via computed tomography and/or X‐ray imaging), requiring hospitalization.3.Hospitalized ≤ 48 h.4.Signing informed consent and willingness of the participant to accept randomization to any assigned treatment arm. Exclusion criteria:1.Underlying conditions, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, cholestatic liver diseases, cholecystitis, peptic ulcers, acute and chronic renal failure, and peptic ulcers.2.Severe and critical COVID‐19 pneumonia.3.History of allergy to favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta‐1a.4.Pregnancy and breastfeeding. Intervention and comparator: Intervention group: favipiravir (Zhejiang Hisun, China) with interferon beta‐1a (CinnaGen, Iran). This group will receive 1600 mg favipiravir twice a day for the first day and 600 mg twice a day for the following 4 days with five doses of 44 mcg interferon beta‐1a every other day. Control group: lopinavir/ritonavir (Heterd Company, India) with interferon beta‐1a (CinnaGen, Iran). This group will receive 200/50 mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice a day for 7 days with five doses of 44 mcg interferon beta‐1a every other day. Other supportive and routine care will be the same in both groups. Main outcomes: The primary outcome of the trial is the viral load of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the nasopharyngeal samples assessed by RT‐PCR after 7 days of randomization as well as clinical improvement of fever and O2 saturation within 7 days of randomization. The secondary outcomes are the length of hospital stay and the incidence of serious adverse drug reactions within 7 days of randomization. Randomization: Eligible patients will be allocated to one of the study arms using block randomization in a 1:1 ratio (each block consists of 10 patients). A web‐based system will be used to generate random numbers for the allocation sequence. Each number relates to one of the study arms. Blinding (masking): This is an open‐label trial without blinding and placebo control. Numbers to be randomized (sample size): A total of 60 patients will be randomized into two groups (30 patients in the intervention group and 30 patients in the control group). Trial status: The trial protocol is version 1.0, 22 July 2020. Recruitment began on 25 July 2020 and is anticipated to be completed by 25 September 2020. Trial registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) IRCT20200506047323N3. Registered on 22 July 2020. Full protocol: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest in expediting the dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.

N2  -  Background: In addition to supportive therapy, antiviral therapy is an effective treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of favipiravir and umifenovir (Arbidol) to treat COVID‐19 patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open‐label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID‐19. Enrolled patients with initial symptoms within 12�days were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Arbidol (200�mg*3/day) or favipiravir (1600�mg*2/first day followed by 600�mg*2/day) for 7�days. The primary outcome was the clinical recovery rate at day 7 of drug administration (relief for pyrexia and cough, respiratory frequency ?24 times/min; oxygen saturation ?98%). Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough and the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV)/mechanical ventilation (MV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17�days. Results: A total of 240 enrolled COVID‐19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 patients were assigned to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). The clinical recovery rate at day 7 of drug administration did not significantly differ between the favipiravir group (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (p = 0.1396, difference in recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: ?0.0305?0.2213). Favipiravir contributed to relief for both pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, p < 0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75 days, p < 0.0001). No difference was observed in the AOT or NMV/MV rate (both p > 0.05). The most frequently observed favipiravir‐associated adverse event was increased serum uric acid (16/116, OR: 5.52, p = 0.0014). Conclusion: Among patients with COVID‐19, favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly improve the clinical recovery rate at day 7. Favipiravir significantly improved the latency to relieve pyrexia and cough. Adverse effects caused by favipiravir are mild and manageable.

N2  -  Background: This exploratory study investigated four repurposed anti‐infective drug regimens in outpatients with COVID‐19. Methods: This phase 2, single centre, randomised, open‐label, clinical trial was conducted in South Africa between 3rd September 2020 and 23rd August 2021. Symptomatic outpatients aged 18–65 years, with RT‐PCR confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were computer randomised (1:1:1:1:1) to standard‐of‐care (SOC) with paracetamol, or SOC plus artesunate‐amodiaquine (ASAQ), pyronaridine‐artesunate (PA), favipiravir plus nitazoxanide (FPV + NTZ), or sofosbuvir‐daclatasvir (SOF‐DCV). The primary endpoint was the incidence of viral clearance, i.e., the proportion of patients with a negative SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR on day 7, compared to SOC using a log‐binomial model in the modified intention‐to‐treat (mITT) population. Findings: The mITT population included 186 patients: mean age (SD) 34.9 (10.3) years, body weight 78.2 (17.1) kg. Day 7 SARS‐CoV‐2 clearance rates (n/N; risk ratio [95% CI]) were: SOC 34.2% (13/38), ASAQ 38.5% (15/39; 0.80 [0.44, 1.47]), PA 30.3% (10/33; 0.69 [0.37, 1.29]), FPV + NTZ 27.0% (10/37; 0.60 [0.31, 1.18]) and SOF‐DCV 23.5% (8/34; 0.47 [0.22, 1.00]). Three lower respiratory tract infections occurred (PA 6.1% [2/33]; SOF‐DCV 2.9% [1/34]); two required hospitalisation (PA, SOF‐DCV). There were no deaths. Adverse events occurred in 55.3% (105/190) of patients, including one serious adverse event (pancytopenia; FPV + NTZ). Interpretation: There was no statistical difference in viral clearance for any regimen compared to SOC. All treatments were well tolerated. Funding: Medicines for Malaria Venture, with funding from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, within the Covid‐19 Therapeutics Accelerator in partnership with Wellcome, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Mastercard.

N2  -  Introduction: Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine (HQ), and darunavir/ritonavir are widely prescribed as an oral treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection despite their uncertainty of clinical benefit. The objective is to determine the safety and the efficacies of two treatment regimens against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Methods: We conducted an open‐labeled, randomized, controlled trial to compare the efficacy between a 3‐day course of once‐daily high‐dose oral ivermectin plus zinc sulfate (Group A) and a combination of HQ, darunavir/ritonavir, and zinc sulfate (HQ + antiretroviral, Group B) for 5 days in asymptomatic or mild SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The study period was between December 2020 and April 2021. Results: Overall, 113 patients were randomized and analyzed (57 patients in Group A and 56 patients in Group B). The median duration to achieve the virological outcome of either undetected or cycle threshold (Ct) for N gene of SARS‐CoV‐2 by real‐time polymerase chain reaction was 6 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3‐6.7) versus 7 days (95% CI: 5.4‐8.6) in Group A and Group B, respectively (P = 0.419) in the modified intention‐to‐treat population. All patients were discharged from hospital quarantine as planned. Two patients in Group A and one patient in Group B were considered clinically worsening and received 10 days of favipiravir treatment. There was no serious adverse event found in both groups. Conclusion: We demonstrated that both treatment regimens were safe, but both treatment regimens had no virological or clinical benefit. Based on this result and current data, there is no supporting evidence for the clinical benefit of ivermectin for coronavirus‐19.

N2  -  Background: Given the persistence of viral RNA in clinically recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients, subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) have been reported as potential molecular viability markers for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). However, few data are available on their longitudinal kinetics, compared with genomic RNA (gRNA), in clinical samples. Methods: We analyzed 536 samples from 205 patients with COVID‐19 from placebo‐controlled, outpatient trials of peginterferon Lambda‐1a (Lambda; n=177) and favipiravir (n=359). Nasal swabs were collected at 3 time points in the Lambda (days 1, 4, and 6) and favipiravir (days 1, 5, and 10) trials. N‐gene gRNA and sgRNA were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To investigate the decay kinetics in vitro, we measured gRNA and sgRNA in A549ACE2+ cells infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, following treatment with remdesivir or dimethylsulfoxide control. Results: At 6 days in the Lambda trial and 10 days in the favipiravir trial, sgRNA remained detectable in 51.6% (32/62) and 49.5% (51/106) of the samples, respectively. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for gRNA and sgRNA were highly linearly correlated (marginal R2 = 0.83), and the rate of increase did not differ significantly in the Lambda trial (1.36 cycles/d vs 1.36 cycles/d; P=.97) or the favipiravir trial (1.03 cycles/d vs 0.94 cycles/d; P=.26). From samples collected 15‐21 days after symptom onset, sgRNA was detectable in 48.1% (40/83) of participants. In SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected A549ACE2+ cells treated with remdesivir, the rate of Ct increase did not differ between gRNA and sgRNA. Conclusions: In clinical samples and in vitro, sgRNA was highly correlated with gRNA and did not demonstrate different decay patterns to support its application as a viability marker.

N2  -  Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), is an enveloped, single‐stranded RNA virus. Favipiravir is an orally administrable antiviral drug whose mechanism of action is to selectively inhibit RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase. A preliminary trial in COVID‐19 patients reported significant improvements across a multitude of clinical parameters, but these findings have not been confirmed in an adequate well‐controlled trial. We conducted a randomized, single‐blind, placebo‐controlled Phase III trial assessing the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in patients with moderate pneumonia not requiring oxygen therapy. Methods: COVID‐19 patients with moderate pneumonia (SpO2 ≥ 94%) within 10 days of onset of fever (temperature ≥ 37.5 °C) were assigned to receive either placebo or favipiravir (1800 mg twice a day on Day 1, followed by 800 mg twice a day for up to 13 days) in a ratio of 1:2. An adaptive design was used to re‐estimate the sample size. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome defined as the time to improvement in temperature, oxygen saturation levels (SpO2), and findings on chest imaging, and recovery to SARS‐CoV‐2‐negative. This endpoint was re‐examined by the Central Committee under blinded conditions. Results: A total of 156 patients were randomized. The median time of the primary endpoint was 11.9 days in the favipiravir group and 14.7 days in the placebo group, with a significant difference (p = 0.0136). Favipiravir‐treated patients with known risk factors such as obesity or coexisting conditions provided better effects. Furthermore, patients with early‐onset in the favipiravir group showed higher odds ratio. No deaths were documented. Although adverse events in the favipiravir group were predominantly transient, the incidence was significantly higher. Conclusions: The results suggested favipiravir may be one of options for moderate COVID‐19 pneumonia treatment. However, the risk of adverse events, including hyperuricemia, should be carefully considered. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.jp number: JapicCTI‐205238.

N2  -  Objectives: The objective of this trial is to assess whether early antiviral therapy in outpatients with COVID‐19 with either favipiravir plus lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir alone, or favipiravir alone, is associated with a decrease in viral load of SARS‐CoV‐2 compared with placebo. Trial design: FLARE is a phase IIA randomised, double‐blind, 2x2 factorial placebo‐controlled, interventional trial. Participants: This trial is being conducted in the United Kingdom, with Royal Free Hospital, London as the lead site. Participants are non‐hospitalised adults with highly suspected COVID‐19 within the first 5 days of symptom onset, or who have tested positive with SARS‐CoV‐2 causing COVID‐19 within the first 7 days of symptom onset, or who are asymptomatic but tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 for the first time within the last 48 hours. Inclusion criteria are as follows: 1.Any adult with the following:Symptoms compatible with COVID‐19 disease (Fever >37.8°C on at least one occasion AND either cough and/ or anosmia) within the first 5 days of symptom onset (date/time of enrolment must be within the first 5 days of symptom onset)OR ANY symptoms compatible with COVID‐19 disease (may include, but are not limited to fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise, myalgia, headache, coryza) and tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 within the first 7 days of symptom onset) (date/time of enrolment must be within the first 7 days of symptom onset)OR no symptoms but tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 within the last 48 hours (date/time of test must be within 48 hours of enrolment)2.Male or female aged 18 years to 70 years old inclusive at screening3.Willing and able to take daily saliva samples4.Able to provide full informed consent and willing to comply with trial‐related procedures Exclusion criteria are as follows:1.Known hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients or excipients in favipiravir and matched placebo, and in lopinavir/ritonavir and matched placebo (See Appendix 2)2.Chronic liver disease at screening (known cirrhosis of any aetiology, chronic hepatitis (e.g. autoimmune, viral, steatohepatitis), cholangitis or any known elevation of liver aminotransferases with AST or ALT > 3 X ULN)*3.Chronic kidney disease (stage 3 or beyond) at screening: eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 *4.HIV infection, if untreated, detectable viral load or on protease inhibitor therapy5.Any clinical condition which the investigator considers would make the participant unsuitable for the trial6.Concomitant medications known to interact with favipiravir and matched placebo, and with lopinavir/ritonavir and matched placebo, and carry risk of toxicity for the participant7.Current severe illness requiring hospitalisation8.Pregnancy and/ or breastfeeding9.Eligible female participants of childbearing potential and male participants with a partner of childbearing potential not willing to use highly effective contraceptive measures during the trial and within the time point specified following last trial treatment dose.10.Participants enrolled in any other interventional drug or vaccine trial (co‐enrolment in observational studies is acceptable)11.Participants who have received the COVID‐19 vaccine *Considering the importance of early treatment of COVID‐19 to impact viral load, the absence of known chronic liver/ kidney disease will be confirmed verbally by the participant during pre‐screening and Screening/Baseline visit. Safety blood samples will be collected at Screening/Baseline visit (Day 1) and test results will be examined as soon as they become available and within 24 hours. Intervention and comparator: Participants will be randomised 1:1:1:1 using a concealed online minimisation process into one of the following four arms:Arm 1: Favipiravir + Lopinavir/ritonavir Oral favipiravir at 1800mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 400mg four (4) times daily from Day 2 to Day 7 PLUS lopinavir/ritonavir at 400mg/100mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 200mg/50mg four (4) times daily from Day 2 to Day 7.Arm 2: Favipiravir + Lopinavir/ritonavir placebo Oral favipiravir at 1800mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 400mg four (4) times daily from Day 2 to Day 7 PLUS lopinavir/ritonavir matched placebo at 400mg/100mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 200mg/50mg four (4) times daily from Day 2 to Day 7.Arm 3: Favipiravir placebo + Lopinavir/ritonavir Oral favipiravir matched placebo at 1800mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 400mg four (4) times daily from Day 2 to Day 7 PLUS lopinavir/ritonavir at 400mg/100mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 200mg/50mg four (4) times daily from Day 2 to Day 7.Arm 4: Favipiravir placebo + Lopinavir/ritonavir placebo Oral favipiravir matched placebo at 1800mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 400mg four (4) times daily from Day 2 to Day 7 PLUS lopinavir/ritonavir matched placebo at 400mg/100mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 200mg/50mg four (4) times daily from Day 2 to Day 7. Main outcomes: The primary outcome is upper respiratory tract viral load at Day 5. Secondary outcomes:Percentage of participants with undetectable upper respiratory tract viral load after 5 days of therapyProportion of participants with undetectable stool viral load after 7 days of therapyRate of decrease in upper respiratory tract viral load during 7 days of therapyDuration of fever following commencement of trial medicationsProportion of participants with hepatotoxicity after 7 days of therapyProportion of participants with other medication‐related toxicity after 7 days of therapy and 14 days post‐randomisationProportion of participants admitted to hospital with COVID‐19 related illnessProportion of participants admitted to ICU with COVID‐19 related illnessProportion of participants who have died with COVID‐19 related illnessPharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of favipiravirExploratory: Proportion of participants with deleterious or resistance‐conferring mutations in SARS‐CoV‐2 Randomisation: Participants will be randomised 1:1:1:1 using a concealed online minimisation process, with the following factors: trial site, age (≤ 55 vs > 55 years old), gender, obesity (BMI <30 vs ≥30), symptomatic or asymptomatic, current smoking status (Yes = current smoker, No = ex‐smoker, never smoker), ethnicity (Caucasian, other) and presence or absence of comorbidity (defined as diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease (including previous myocardial infarction), other heart disease (arrhythmia and valvular heart disease), asthma, COPD, other chronic respiratory disease).

N2  -  Background: Favipiravir is used to treat influenza, and studies demonstrate that it has antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Methods: We performed a randomized, open‐label, multicenter, phase 2 proof‐of‐concept trial of favipiravir in hospitalized adult patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Patients were randomized to standard of care (SOC) or favipiravir treatment (1800mg per os twice a day [b.i.d.] on day 1, followed by 1000mg b.i.d. for 13 days). The primary end point was time to viral clearance on day 29. Results: Fifty patients were enrolled and stratified by disease severity (critical disease, severe disease, or mild to moderate disease). Nineteen patients were censored from the event of viral clearance based on being SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR‐negative at the study outset, being PCR‐positive at day 29, or because of loss to follow‐up. Data from the 31 remaining patients who achieved viral clearance show enhanced viral clearance in the favipiravir group compared with the SOC group by day 29, with 72% of the favipiravir group and 52% of the SOC group being evaluable for viral clearance through day 29. The median time to viral clearance was 16.0 days (90% CI, 12.0 to 29.0) in the favipiravir group and 30.0 days (90% CI, 12.0 to 31.0) in the SOC group. A post hoc analysis revealed an effect in the subgroup of patients who were neutralizing antibody‐negative at randomization. Treatment‐emergent adverse events were equally distributed between the groups. Conclusions: We demonstrate that favipiravir can be safely administered to hospitalized adults with COVID‐19 and believe that further studies are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04358549.

N2  -  The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the Favipiravir (Areplivir) drug, compared to the standard etiotropic therapy in the patients hospitalized with COVID‐19. Material and methods. The research was conducted as a part of an open, randomized, multicenter comparative study of the efficacy and safety of Areplivir, 200 mg film‐coated tablets ("PROMOMED RUS" LLC, Russia), in the patients hospitalized with COVID‐19. The dosing regimen of Favipiravir was 1600 mg twice a day on the 1st day and 600 mg twice a day on days 2 14. Thirty nine patients were enrolled into the study with a laboratory‐established diagnosis of a new type of Coronavirus infection caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 (confirmed) of moderate severity, with pneumonia. The group of comparison (22 patients) received standard etiotropic therapy, prescribed in accordance with the current version of the temporary guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID‐19, represented mainly by Hydroxychloroquine with the dosage regimen of 800 mg on the 1st day, then 400 mg on days 2 7, and Azithromycin 500 mg once a day for 5 days. The main group (17 patients) received Favipiravir (Areplivir) as etiotropic therapy. Results. In the main group, the time period until fever disappeared was found to be 1.36 days shorter than in the group of comparison (p0.05); there was a higher rate of the reduction of inflammatory changes in the lungs according to the computer tomography data (38.4% vs 14.9%, p0.05). By the end of the treatment, there was also a lower lactate level in the blood (27.1%, p0.05) than in the patients of the group of comparison. The evaluation of the drug efficacy according to the Categorical Ordinal Scale of Clinical Improvement and measurements of oxygen saturation in the blood, manifested similar positive dynamics in the patients treated according to various etiotropic therapy regimens. By the end of the treatment, the RNA SARS‐CoV‐2 tests were also negative in all the patients. As for the overall frequency of adverse events (AEs), no relevant distinctions were found between the groups. A greater part of AEs was related to hepatotoxicity, with a predominantly clinically relevant increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). A clinically relevant prolongation of the corrected QT interval on the standard ECG was found to occur in the standard‐Therapy group on day 5, while no serious AEs were registered in the main group. No serious adverse reactions were registered in patients of the main group. Conclusion. The efficacy of the Favipiravir (Areplivir) therapy for the novel coronavirus infection has proved to be superior to the efficacy of the standard etiotropic therapy in a number of aspects. Basing on the obtained findings, Favipiravir (Areplivir) drug can be recommended for treating patients with the novel coronavirus infection of moderate severity.

N2  -  Mefenamic acid is a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug exhibiting a wide range of anti‐inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and probable antiviral activities. The present study evaluated the efficacy of treatment with mefenamic acid combined with standard medical care vs. standard medical care plus a placebo in ambulatory patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19; nasal/oropharyngeal swabs reverse transcription‐PCR test results positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The present study is a phase II prospective, two‐arm, parallel‐group, randomized, double‐blind placebo‐controlled clinical trial which analyzed 36 patients. Two aspects were evaluated during the 14‐day follow‐up period: i) The time for reaching a patient acceptable symptom state (PASS), and ii) the last day of each COVID‐19 symptom presentation. Adverse effects were evaluated. The clinical severity for all the patients in the study was mild (88.9%) and moderate (11.1%). The control (placebo) group achieved PASS on day 8.0±1.3, compared with day 4.4±0.8 in the mefenamic acid group (P=0.020, Kaplan‐Meier analyses using log‐rank tests). Patients that received mefenamic acid plus standard medical care had a 16‐fold higher probability of achieving PASS on day 8 (adjusted RR, 15.57; 95% CI, 1.22‐198.71; P=0.035), compared with the placebo plus standard medical care group. All symptoms lasted for fewer days in the mefenamic acid group, compared with the placebo group; however, only the symptoms of headache (P=0.008), retro‐orbital eye pain (P=0.049), and sore throat (P=0.029) exhibited statistically significant differences. The experimental treatment produced no severe adverse effects. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that the administration of mefenamic acid markedly reduced the symptomatology and time to reach PASS in ambulatory patients with COVID‐19. Due to its probable antiviral effects and potent anti‐inflammatory mechanisms, mefenamic acid may prove to be useful in the treatment of COVID‐19, in combination with other drugs, including the new antivirals (remdesivir, molnupiravir, or favipiravir). However, future studies are also required to confirm these findings.

N2  -  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infections are rapidly spreading worldwide and continue to be a global public health crisis. The use of repurposed drugs with the potential to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 could be a vital alternative approach when the novel therapeutic has not yet available. The guidelines for emergency treatment of COVID‐19 vary across different countries and largely rely on the off‐label prescription of repurposed drugs. As a result, clinical studies to generate robust efficacy data for these repurposed drugs are warranted to effectively fight against the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic. The broad spectrum antiparasitic drug ivermectin has previously been shown to exhibit broad antiviral activities against many RNA and DNA viruses. It has a reliable safety profile with comprehensive data for decades especially in mass drug administration programs for river blindness prophylaxis in several countries in Africa. Owing to its strong inhibitory activity against the replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro and its putative role in reducing cytokine storm, the drug has been repurposed to treat COVID‐19 patients and has shown promising results in several clinical studies. Ivermectin has thus gained a considerable attention as a potential treatment for COVID‐19. However, the National Institute of Health (NIH) and World Health Organization (WHO) currently state that studies on using ivermectin to treat COVID‐19 patients remain inconclusive due to insufficient data. Therefore, a large well designed randomized, double blinded, placebo‐controlled trial to assess the efficacy of ivermectin is urgently needed. Another important treatment option for COVID‐19 is favipiravir, an antiviral drug for influenza treatment. Although the drug has not been approved for a COVID‐19 treatment by the US‐FDA, it has been included in Guidelines on clinical practice, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of healthcare‐associated infection for COVID‐19 in Thailand. Favipiravir, a known inhibitor of RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase, was shown to have an in vitro activity against SARS‐CoV‐2. The meta‐analysis showed a significant improvement in clinical outcome at day 14 along with chest imaging in the favipiravir group compared to standard care. However, there are no significant differences in terms of clinical deterioration rates, viral clearance, oxygen support requirement and side effect profiles. There are still ongoing clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID‐19. Antivirals can be generally divided into direct‐acting antivirals (DAA) and host‐targeting drugs. For example, the widely used drug remdesivir repurposed to treat COVID‐19 is a DAA, and chloroquine is considered a host‐targeting drug. Because these repurposed drugs were not specifically designed and developed for COVID‐19, they are likely to be less efficacious, and partner drugs need to be further explored. Finding a right combination for DAA is a common practice for developing virus treatment regimens. Relying on different modes of action and absence of unfavorable drug interaction, the combinations are usually additive or synergistic. It is important to note that our in vitro data demonstrated the synergistic profile for the combination of favipiravir and ivermectin against SARS‐CoV‐2. It resulted in 4‐fold reduction in the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) as compared to individual drugs, from 1.2 µM to 0.3 µM with a peak Loewe synergy score of over 33.2 and a mean score of 18.8 (noted that Loewe synergy score > 10 indicates synergistic effect). In response to this COVID‐19 pandemic crisis, especially in a resource limited setting like Thailand, clinical studies to evaluate affordable and implementable interventions are a priority and are urgently needed. Ivermectin, a cheap and safe drug, has been widely used in humans for decades, and it has also demonstrated an inhibitory effect against SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro. Here, we aim to conduct a multi‐center, double‐blind, randomized controlled trial in Thailand to reveal the effectiveness of ivermectin as a combination therapy with favipiravir (standard treatment) for COVID‐19. The results of this study will provide much needed information for pursuing larger efficacy clinical trials to confirm whether the combination could be effectively used to treat COVID‐19. Also, they could provide information on the rate of viral clearance, the primary endpoint of this study, which was proposed to be a predictive surrogate of clinical benefits and used as a proper endpoint in the phase II trials for candidate drug screening for COVID‐19.

N2  -  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is declared as an international emergency in 2020. Its prevalence and fatality rate are rapidly increasing but the medication options are still limited for this perilous disease. The emergent outbreak of COVID‐19 triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) keeps propagating globally. The present scenario has emphasized the requirement for therapeutic opportunities to relive and overcome this latest pandemic. Despite the fact, the deteriorating developments of COVID‐19, there is no drug certified to have considerable effects in the medical treatment for COVID‐19 patients. The COVID‐19 pandemic requests for the rapid testing of new treatment approaches. Based on the evidence, hydroxychloroquine is the first medicine opted for the treatment of disease. Umifenovir, remdesivir, and favipiravir are deemed the most hopeful antiviral agent by improving the health of infected patients. The dexamethasone is a first known steroid medicine that can save the lives of seriously ill patients, and it is shown in a randomized clinical trial by the United Kingdom that it reduced the death rate in COVID‐19 patients. The current review recapitulates the existing evidence of possible therapeutic drugs, peptides, humanized antibodies, convulsant plasma, and vaccination that has revealed potential in fighting COVID‐19 infections. Many randomized and controlled clinical trials are taking place to further validate these agent’s safety and effectiveness in curing COVID‐19.

N2  -  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2/2019‐nCoV) and has developed into a pandemic with serious global public health and economic sequelae As of April 27, 2020 over 2,973,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide leading to over 206,000 deaths (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). There is no current vaccine available, but there have been a number of reports of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine having antiviral properties with efficacy against COVID‐19 disease. Chloroquine is used in the treatment of malaria and amebiasis and is still used in the prophylaxis of malaria. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is a derivative of Chloroquine that has been demonstrated to be much less ( 40%) toxic than Chloroquine in animals. Hydroxychloroquine is widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, due to its immunomodulatory properties, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, with an excellent safety profile. In vitro studies have suggested that their mode of action in COVID‐19 disease is to block the transport of SARS‐CoV‐2 from endosomes to endolysosomes, which appears to be a requirement to release the viral genome as in the case of SARS‐CoV. Clinical investigation has found that a high concentration of cytokines were detected in the plasma of critically ill patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, suggesting that cytokine storm was associated with disease severity; therefore, Chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine as anti‐inflammatory agents may reduce this response in accord with their use in autoimmune disease where the cytokine response can be reduced. Favipiravir is an antiviral drug developed in Japan that the data sheet notes that it is a pyrazinecarboxamide derivative with activity against influenza viruses, west nile virus, yellow fever virus, foot and mouth disease virus as well as against flaviviruses, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses and alphaviruses. Its mode of action is through inhibition of viral RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase. In February the drug was used for COVID‐19 disease in China and was declared effective in treatment, and a report published (in press) comparing Favipiravir with Lopinavir /ritonavir suggested that Favipiravir was superior for prevention of disease progression and viral clearance. A large pragmatic clinical trial is being undertaken globally by WHO, the solidarity trial, and application has been made in Bahrain to be part of that study. In the solidarity study there are to be 4 arms; chloroquine phosphate alone, remdesivir, lopinarvir with ritonavir or lopinarvir with ritonavir plus interferon. It may therefore be seen that this Favipiravir does not replicate the features of the solidarity trial.

N2  -  The COVID‐19 pandemic (Coronavirus Disease‐19) caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) has caused more that 10 million infections worldwide, with a general mortality of 6%. Multiple studies have found that the hyperinflammatory immune response induced by SARS‐CoV‐2 is one of the main causes of severity and death in infected patients. In severe COVID‐19 patients, an association was found between pneumonitis and/or ARDS (Acute Severe Respiratory Syndrome), increased serum levels of cytokines and chemokines, extensive lung damage and microthrombosis. Studies of both gene expression in lungs and blood cytokines and chemokines have related chemokine signaling clusters with COVID‐19 severity, being CCL3, CCL4 and CCL7 (CC chemokine ligands 3, 4 and 7) particularly interesting. All these are CCR5 (CC chemokine receptor 5) ligands. A strategy to modulate activation and trafficking of leukocytes to the lungs is by blocking CCR5 by using maraviroc (MVC), which has shown capable of modulating conditions of generalized inflammation. Along with a good regulation of the immune response, an antiviral that helps to reduce the viral load must be considered. Favipiravir (FPV) has shown to be capable to reduce the time of viral clearance by half. Hence, we propose that the conjoint use of MVC and FPV could help to reduce the progression of severe hospitalized COVID‐19 patients to critical by decreasing the percentage of patients in need of mechanical respiratory support or death by at least 30%. This is a randomized, controlled clinical trial that besides evaluating the safety and efficacy of MVC+FPV to avoid progression in severe COVID‐19 patients as a primary endpoint, is also aimed at other secondary endpoints: A) Evaluate the activation of CCR5 in peripheral blood lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. B) Find possible modifications in the ongoing chemokine and cytokine storm in serum, particularly IL‐6, IL‐1b, (interleukins 6 and 1 beta) TNF (tumor necrosis factor), IFNa, IFNg (interferons alpha and gamma), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), CXCL10 (CXC chemokine ligand 10), CCL7, CCL3, and CCL5 (CC chemokine ligands 7, 3 and 5), C) Search for alterations in the patterns of activation, trafficking, and exhaustion of peripheral blood lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils, and D) Determine if it has an effect in viral loads in saliva. 100 severe patients tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 will be randomized in 4 treatment arms: Arm A: Currently used therapy (CT) only, Enoxaparin, dexamethasone, and antibiotics if associated bacteremia is present, as per currently used at Hospital General de México "Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"). Arm B: CT+MVC Arm C: CT+FPV Arm D: CT+MVC+FPV

N2  -  Favipiravir, previously known as T‐705, is a prodrug of a purine nucleotide, favipiravir ribofuranosyl‐5'‐triphosphate. The active agent inhibits the RNA polymerase, halting viral replication. Most of favipiravir's preclinical data are derived from its influenza and Ebola activity; however, the agent also demonstrated broad activity against other RNA viruses. In vitro, the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of favipiravir against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) was 61.88 μM/L in Vero E6 cells. Limited clinical experience has been reported supporting the use of favipiravir for COVID‐19. In a prospective, randomized, multicenter study, favipiravir (n = 120) was compared with Arbidol (n = 120) for the treatment of moderate and severe COVID‐19 infections. Differences in clinical recovery at day 7 were observed in patients with moderate infections (71.4% favipiravir and 55.9% Arbidol, P = .019). No significant differences were observed in the severe or severe and moderate (combined) arms.73 These data support further investigation with randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of the efficacy of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID‐19. Chloroquine has been a broadly‐utilized anti‐malaria agent which back in 2006, had been proved to be a powerful wide‐spectrum antiviral. Moreover, Chloroquine has the characteristics of anti‐inflammatory and immune‐modulatory by inhibiting the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α) along with interleukin 6 (IL‐6). In the first half of February, a study illustrated puissant inhibition of SARS‐CoV‐2 by Chloroquine, when taking two 500‐mg tablets of it by mouth per day; similar to some clinical studies in China through this outbreak. According to the news briefing of a study, it was indicated that chloroquine phosphate actually outdo the control treatment in inhibition of pneumonia exacerbation, improving lung imaging findings, and curtailing the disease course. Another study evaluated the possible doses of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to find the optimized dose in treatment of COVID‐19. They revealed that while within in‐vitro settings Hydroxychloroquine is more potent than chloroquine. As a conclusion, they suggested a 800 mg daily dose of hydroxychloroquine, followed by an overall maintenance dose of 400 mg per day divided in two separate doses, which was three‐fold more potent compared to the 500 mg twice daily administration of chloroquine in 5 days. The new study published in 16th March, pointed out that hydroxychloroquine was notably effectual in eradicating SARS‐CoV‐2 from the nasopharynx. Currently the evidence is quite inconclusive about the effectiveness or comparative effectiveness of either HCQ or CQ. Moreover, CQ has recently become scarce and even unavailable for ordering due to a huge demand for it, all because of a significant interest gained as a potential medicinal alternative for the management of COVID‐19. In spite of all, the primary experience in China and France is propitious for the potential role of chloroquine, or alternatively hydroxychloroquine, for managing COVID‐19. The present study is a randomized, double‐blind, controlled, clinical trial, with the approval of the ethics committee will be conducted on patients who have a positive test confirming COVID‐19 in Shahid Modarres Medical Education Center and Hospital in Tehran. Patients will be randomly assigned to the two arms of the study and after completing the course of treatment and collecting and analyzing the necessary information from each patient, the results of the study will be published both on this site and in the form of an article in a reputable international journal.

N2  -  Introduction: The incidence of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV 2) worldwide is still on the rise and the prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) still a major challenge. Among those existing medications used for COVID‐19 are intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) which are known for their anti‐inflammatory effects and approved in several immune mediated disorders, including Kawasaki syndrome. Several case reports showing beneficial effects of IVIG administration in COVID‐19 patients have been reported recently (1‐5) Objectives: To compare clinical outcomes and biomarkers in patients with severe COVID‐19 treated with standard of care (SoC) alone or with SoC and IVIG. Methods: Data from a cohort of severely ill COVID‐19 patients requiring intensive care at a center of excellence in Turkey was analysed retrospectively. A subgroup of patients received high‐dose IVIG (Octagam 5%) treatment at 0.4 g/day for 5 consecutive days in addition to SoC according to a site‐specific treatment algorithm and was compared to those patients receiving SoC alone. Clinical outcome measures included duration of specific treatment modalities, time to start of mechanical ventilation, change in ventilation mode, ICU and hospital discharge, and overall survival. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, ferritin, PCT, IL‐6, D‐dimer, leukocytes) were measured at baseline and 6 days after ICU admission and treatment start. Imbalance in APACHE II scores was addressed by propensity‐score‐matching; otherwise Kaplan‐Meier and multiple regression models were used. Results: Data from 93 patients were included into analysis. Of these, 51 had received IVIG plus SoC and 42 were treated with SoC alone. In both groups, about 75% of patients were male and patients had comparable BMI and blood group distribution as well as comparable vital signs. The IVIG group was slightly younger (mean: 65 vs. 71 years) and had slightly lower baseline disease scores (mean APACHE II: 20.6 vs. 22.4; mean SOFA: 5.0 vs. 7.0). Apart from IVIG, patients in both groups were treated with hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, azithromycin, oseltamivir, tocilizumab/anakinra, methylprednisolone, and/or ascorbate. Analysis showed that overall survival (OS) was 61% in the IVIG and 38% in the control group. After controlling for imbalances at baseline, there remained a trend for better OS (OR: 2.2, 95%CI: 0.9‐5.4, p=0.091) and a significantly longer median survival (68 vs. 18 days, p=0.014). Moreover, IVIG treatment significantly reduced CRP levels by 46% within 6 days compared to SoC alone (p=0.049), but had no relevant effect on any other inflammation marker measured. Conclusion: Adjunct treatment with IVIG might add to the currently limited armamentarium against COVID‐19, especially due to its wellknown anti‐inflammatory properties. However, results need to be confirmed in a randomized, controlled trial.

N2  -  •Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is defined as illness caused by a novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2; formerly called 2019‐nCoV), which was first identified amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. It was initially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID‐19 outbreak a global health emergency. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID‐19 a global pandemic, its first such designation since declaring influenza A virus subtype (H1N1) influenza a pandemic in 2009. No drugs or biologics have been proven to be effective for the prevention or treatment of COVID‐19. Numerous antiviral agents, immunotherapies, and vaccines are being investigated and developed as potential therapies Fujifilm Toyama Chemical has started a Phase III clinical trial of its antiviral influenza drug Avigan (favipiravir) for the treatment of Covid‐19 patients in Japan. Avigan specifically blocks RNA polymerase associated with influenza viral replication. The mechanism is expected to have an antiviral effect on SARS‐CoV‐2, the novel coronavirus that causes Covid‐19. In Japan, the new Phase III trial will assess Avigan's safety and efficacy as a potential Covid‐19 treatment. Last month, China's Science and Technology Ministry official Zhang Xinmin said that favipiravir helped patients recover in an 80‐day participant trial conducted in Shenzhen city. According to the study data, the drug was able to shorten the recovery time from 11 days to four days for mild and moderate cases. Favipiravir secured Chinese approval for manufacturing by Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical to treat adults with new or recurring influenza. It also holds approval in China as an investigational treatment for Covid‐19. A drug developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical in Japan is showing promising outcomes in treating at least mild to moderate cases of COVID‐19, Live Science previously reported. The antiviral drug, called Favipiravir or Avigan, has been used in Japan to treat influenza, and last month, the drug was approved as an experimental treatment for COVID‐19 infection. The drug, which works by preventing certain viruses from replicating, seemed to shorten the duration of the virus as well as improve lung conditions (as seen in X‐rays) in tested patients. A few studies have been published in international journals regarding the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir. However, this type of study on Favipiravir (Favipira) has not yet been done in our country. This is the rationale why we have designed this clinical trial in Bangladesh to fight against COVID‐19 a global pandemic. Objectives: •General Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir (Favipira) for the treatment of COVID‐19 in a group of Bangladeshi patients Specific objectives: Primary end point: •To assess the treatment efficacy: Negative for the virus at 4‐10 days after initiation of therapy. However, negative results for the viral presence should be with an interval of at least 24 hours. ‐ To assess the treatment efficacy: X‐ray findings of lung condition improvement at Day‐4, Day‐7 and Day‐10 of therapy. Secondary end point: ‐ Clinical recovery rate at 7‐10 days of therapy and reduced duration of fever, cough, relief time auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rate. ‐ To assess the adverse effects of drug. ‐ ICU admission rate ‐ Mortality rate Hypothesis Favipiravir might be an effective drug for the treatment of COVID‐19. Methodology: Study design: Double‐blind, placebo‐controlled randomized control study. Randomization will be done by computerized randomization table. Place of study: Mahanagar General Hospital, Dhaka (Site‐1), Mugda Medical College Hospital, Dhaka (Site‐2), Kurmitola General Hospital, Dhaka (Site‐3), Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Dhaka (Site‐4) Duration of study: 2 months Study population: Clinically and Laboratory‐confirmed patients with COVID‐19 Formulae: Variable Notations: Α, the probability of type I error (significance level) is the probability of rejecting the true null hypothesis (0.05) Β, the probability of type II error (1 ‐ power of the test) is the probability of failing to reject the false null hypothesis (0.80). PA (proportion of discordant pairs of type A) among discordant pairs (1/4) PD (proportion of discordant) pairs among all pairs (0.25) Npairs, required sample size pair =25*2=50 A matched‐pair design is used, in which patients are matched on age and clinical stage of COVID‐19, with one patient in a matched pair assigned to treatment case and the other to treatment control. It is estimated that patients in a matched pair will respond similarly to the treatments in 85% of matched pairs. How many matched pairs need to be enrolled in the study to have a 90% chance of finding a significant difference using a two‐sided test with type I error = 0.05? So, we will recruit a total of 50 patients Randomization will be done by computerized randomization table Group A Patient (25) = Favipiravir + Standard Treatment Group B Patient (25) = Only Standard Treatment For better result sample size may be multiply on the basis of availability of COVID‐19 patient in the study hospital. Diagnostic Criteria All patients diagnosed as COVID‐19 positive on the basis of clinical and Laboratory findings. If the respiratory specimens give positive results upon RT‐PCR analysis at the lab targeting conserved viral gene(s), such as E gene and or RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene or other COVID‐19 specific genes, it will be considered as confirmed positive case for COVID‐19. Data Collection Procedure: Patient admitted in Isolation ward with COVID‐19 positive will be used. Study population again will be confirmed by laboratory findings. Patients will be selected for the study following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Written consent will be taken from the patient for treatment with Favipiravir. After data collection, data will be analyzed for result. Finally, Summary and conclusion will be published. Background of Data Collectors at the clinical sites: Data will be collected by Co‐investigators of the study who are employed as physicians in the Isolation word for COVID‐19 positive patients in the designated hospitals. Co‐investigators are familiar about the data collection procedure as per clinical trial protocol. Precaution and safety of the Data Collectors including physicians, laboratory personnel, nurses, and medical technologists: Data Collectors should fill up data collection sheet properly. Proper monitoring of the patient should be carefully done. Data collectors must wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gown, N95 mask, hand gloves, head coverings and goggles to protect themselves. I case, anyone involved in the study get infected, he/she should be sent to the designated isolation unit/quarantine to mitigate spread of the disease and get treatment. Treatment: Management of adverse events: For any occurrence due mismanagement with the side effects of Favipiravir, the entire research team will be responsible. Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting time: Follow‐up System: Statistical Analysis: •Utilization of Results: ‐ Ethical Implications: ‐ Permission will be taken from Bangladesh Medical Research Council and The Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) for conducting this study. Favipiravir 200 mg (Favipira) tablet will be given orally. Day 1: Tablet Favipiravir 1600 mg twice daily Days 2−Days 10: Tablet Favipiravir 600 mg twice daily. Group A Patient (25) = Favipiravir + Standard Treatment Group B Patient (25) = Only Standard Treatment Standard treatment included oxygen inhalation, oral or intravenous rehydration, electrolyte correction, antipyretics, analgesics, antibiotics and antiemetic drugs & the medication any patient is on due to any concomitant diseases. It has been suggested that host cell enzymes (cellular kinases) convert Favipiravir into Favipiravir ribofuranosyl phosphate, a form that inhibits virus polymerase without affecting host cellular RNA or DNA synthesis. Research documents indicate that Favipiravir is a well‐tolerated drug with some side effects like headache, nausea and hypersensivity. On prolong treatment it may develop inflammation of liver and kidney, abortion, intrauterine fetal death, and congenital anomalies of newborn baby. Considering the longterm effects of Favipiravir, patients with Chronic liver and kidney disease, previous history of allergic reactions to Favipiravir, Pregnant or lactating women, Women of a childbearing age with a positive pregnancy test and having history of Miscarriage, or within 2 weeks after delivery have been excluded in the study proposal. Management of side effects like headache, nausea and hypersensitivity will counter at the early stage of onset and all medicines and instruments will be kept available at the ward near the patient bed for prompt management during treatment with Favipiravir. Any adverse or side effect will be managed immediately with standard treatment procedure with discontinuation of the test drug Research physicians under the supervision of Clinical Trial Monitors will monitor clinically all the vital signs along with adverse symptoms (if any arise) routinely and be available for taking measures against any side or adverse effect. They will record all the events clinically along with the routine data collection. If any adverse drug reaction occurs during study period it should be reported within 24 hours of the event to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) in order to assess the risk and quick action should be taken. Laboratory data collection Blood and respiratory samples will be collected by trained medical technologist and transported immediately to Institute for developing Science and Health initiatives (ideSHi) for analysis. Cool chain will be maintained during sample transportation. Blood sample analysis at the laboratory will be done by trained research officers and fellows. On the other hand, RT‐PCR using respiratory samples for viral detection will be done by expert molecular biologist. Baseline clinical symptoms and Laboratory findings will be monitored from first day and follow up will be continued at Day‐4, Day‐7 and Day‐10. Viral clearance will be checked by RT‐PCR at Day‐4, Day‐7 and Day‐10. X‐ray findings will be monitored from Day‐1 followed by Day‐4, Day‐7 and Day‐10 to see the lung condition. Any Side effects of drugs will be documented. All data will be analyzed by using the statistical package for social science (SPSS) 22. All data will be provided as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Chi‐square test will be used to compare differences between the frequencies. Serum cytokines levels will be analyzed using the normality test. P value < 0.05 will be considered significant. ‐ Before data collection objective of the study will be informed to the respondent. ‐ Informed written consent will be obtained from the participants of the study ‐ The privacy and confidentiality will strictly be maintained during data collection ‐ Right to discontinue from the study at any time will be ensured A recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) caused by the novel coronavirus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) started in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. The clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia. According to world health organization (WHO), COVID‐19 updates on 10th April, 2020, globally confirmed cases were 16,17,204, confirmed deaths were 97,039, recovered 364686 peoples. In Bangladesh confirmed cases were 424, confirmed deaths were 27, recovered 33 peoples. No drugs or biologics have been proven to be effective for the prevention or treatment of COVID‐19. Numerous antiviral agents, immunotherapies, and vaccines are being investigated and developed as potential therapies. A drug developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical in Japan is showing promising outcomes in treating at least mild to moderate cases of COVID‐19, Live Science previously reported.

The drug, which works by preventing certain viruses from replicating, seemed to shorten the duration of the virus as well as improve lung conditions (as seen in X‐rays) in tested patients.In our study on Favipiravir (Favipira), if we will get promising result regarding efficacy and safety, then it saves thousands life of Bangladeshi people. We may also export the Medicine across the globe to fight against COVID‐19 a global pandemic. ‐ Facilities: Kurmitola General Hospital and Kuwait Bangladesh Maitry Govt. Hospital, both Hospitals are Bangladesh Govt. approved hospital for COVID‐19 treatment. So, almost all facilities will be available. ‐ Any adverse or side effect will be managed immediately with standard treatment procedure with discontinuation of the test drug

N2  -  Background: Effective antiviral drugs for COVID‐19 are still lacking. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes and plasma concentrations of baloxavir acid and favipiravir in COVID‐19 patients. Methods: Favipiravir and baloxavir acid were evaluated for their antiviral activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro before the trial initiation. We conducted an exploratory trial with 3 arms involving hospitalized adult patients with COVID‐19. Patients were randomized assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio into baloxavir marboxil group, favipiravir group, and control group. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects with viral negative by Day 14 and the time from randomization to clinical improvement. Virus load reduction, blood drug concentration and clinical presentation were also observed. The trial was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR 2000029544). Results: Baloxavir acid showed antiviral activity in vitro with the half‐maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 5.48 μM comparable to arbidol and lopinavir, but favipiravir didn't demonstrate significant antiviral activity up to 100 μM. Thirty patients were enrolled. The percentage of patients who turned viral negative after 14‐day treatment was 70%, 77%, and 100% in the baloxavir marboxil, favipiravir, and control group respectively, with the medians of time from randomization to clinical improvement was 14, 14 and 15 days, respectively. One reason for the lack of virological effect and clinical benefits may be due to insufficient concentrations of these drugs relative to their antiviral activities. One of the limitations of this study is the time from symptom onset to randomization, especially in the baloxavir marboxil and control groups, which is higher than the favipiravir group. Conclusions: Our findings could not prove a benefit of addition of either baloxavir marboxil or favipiravir under the trial dosages to the existing standard treatment.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: The global pandemic called COVID‐19 has dragged the world into a healthcare crisis, and favipiravir is one of the most prescribed agents against the virus so far. Favipiravir is a repurposed antiviral agent in treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and to meet the current need, pharmaceutical companies are working for manufacturing licensed generic favipiravir. For getting the marketing authorization, the bioequivalence of the generic product must be proven first. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the bioequivalence of a new favipiravir tablet formulation as compared to the reference tablet formulation in healthy male subjects under fasting conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To prove the bioequivalence, a randomized, single oral dose, cross‐over, two‐period study was carried out in 30 healthy subjects under fasting conditions. Plasma favipiravir levels were quantified by using an in‐house‐developed high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detector (LC‐MSD) method. RESULTS: The 90% CIs for the test/reference geometric mean ratios of the Cmax and AUC0‐tlast were 88.02 ‐ 103.11% and 98.19 ‐ 102.06%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This single‐dose study has shown that the test and reference favipiravir products met the required bioequivalence criteria. Besides, both products were well tolerated and safe.

N2  -  No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID‐19. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir in treatment of COVID‐19. This was a multicenter randomized controlled study including 96 patients with COVID‐ 19 who were randomly assigned into a chloroquine (CQ) group and a favipiravir group. None of the patients in the favipiravir group needed mechanical ventilation (p = 0.129). One patient (2.3%) in the favipiravir group and two patients (4.2%) in the CQ group died (p = 1.00). Favipiravir is a promising drug for COVID‐19 that decreases the hospital stay and the need for mechanical ventilation.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04351295.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The role of favipiravir in preventing disease progression in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) remains uncertain. We aimed to determine its effect in preventing disease progression from nonhypoxia to hypoxia among high‐risk COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: This was an open‐label, randomized clinical trial conducted at 14 public hospitals across Malaysia (February‐July 2021) among 500 symptomatic, RT‐PCR‐confirmed COVID‐19 patients, aged ≥50 years with ≥1 comorbidity, and hospitalized within first 7 days of illness. Patients were randomized 1:1 to favipiravir plus standard care or standard care alone. Favipiravir was administered at 1800 mg 2×/day on day 1 followed by 800 mg 2×/day until day 5. The primary endpoint was rate of clinical progression from nonhypoxia to hypoxia. Secondary outcomes included rates of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in‐hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 500 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 62.5 [8.0] years; 258 women [51.6%]; 251 [50.2%] had COVID‐19 pneumonia), 487 (97.4%) patients completed the trial. Clinical progression to hypoxia occurred in 46 (18.4%) patients on favipiravir plus standard care and 37 (14.8%) on standard care alone (OR, 1.30; 95% CI: .81‐2.09; P = .28). All 3 prespecified secondary endpoints were similar between both groups. Mechanical ventilation occurred in 6 (2.4%) vs 5 (2.0%) (OR, 1.20; 95% CI: .36‐4.23; P = .76), ICU admission in 13 (5.2%) vs 12 (4.8%) (OR, 1.09; 95% CI: .48‐2.47; P = .84), and in‐hospital mortality in 5 (2.0%) vs 0 (OR, 12.54; 95% CI: .76‐207.84; P = .08) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among COVID‐19 patients at high risk of disease progression, early treatment with oral favipiravir did not prevent their disease progression from nonhypoxia to hypoxia.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, COVID‐19 has spread to almost every corner of the world. In theory, tocilizumab and favipiravir are considered to be reliable drugs for the treatment of COVID‐19 with elevated IL‐6. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab combined with favipiravir in patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: This was a multicenter trial in adults with COVID‐19. Patients were randomly assigned (3:1:1) to a 14‐day combination of favipiravir combined with tocilizumab (combination group), favipiravir, and tocilizumab. The primary outcome was the cumulative lung lesion remission rate (lung CT examination indicated absorption of lung inflammation). RESULTS: Between Feb 2 and March 15, 2020, 26 patients were recruited; 14 were randomly assigned to the combination group, 7 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 5 were assigned to the tocilizumab group. The cumulative lung lesion remission rate at day 14 was significantly higher in combination group as compared with favipiravir group (P?=?0.019, HR 2.66 95 % CI [1.08‐6.53]). And there was also a significant difference between tocilizumab and favipivavir (P?=?0.034, HR 3.16, 95 % CI 0.62‐16.10). In addition, there was no significant difference between the combination group and the tocilizumab group (P?=?0.575, HR 1.28 95 %CI 0.39‐4.23). Furthermore, combined therapy can also significantly relieve clinical symptoms and help blood routine to return to normal. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab combined with or without favipiravir can effectively improve the pulmonary inflammation of COVID‐19 patients and inhibit the deterioration of the disease.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in adults with mild‐to‐moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). METHODS: In this randomized, open‐label, parallel‐arm, multicenter, phase 3 trial, adults (18‐75 years) with RT‐PCR confirmed COVID‐19 and mild‐to‐moderate symptoms (including asymptomatic) were randomized 1:1 to oral favipiravir (day 1: 1800 mg BID and days 2‐14: 800 mg BID) plus standard supportive care versus supportive care alone. The primary endpoint was time to the cessation of viral shedding; time to clinical cure was also measured. RESULTS: From May 14 to July 3, 2020, 150 patients were randomized to favipiravir (n = 75) or control (n = 75). Median time to the cessation of viral shedding was 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 7 days) versus 7 days (95% CI: 5 days, 8 days), P = 0.129, and median time to clinical cure was 3 days (95% CI: 3 days, 4 days) versus 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 6 days), P = 0.030, for favipiravir and control, respectively. Adverse events were observed in 36% of favipiravir and 8% of control patients. One control patient died due to worsening disease. CONCLUSION: The lack of statistical significance on the primary endpoint was confounded by limitations of the RT‐PCR assay. Significant improvement in time to clinical cure suggests favipiravir may be beneficial in mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐19.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Using CT findings from a prospective, randomized, open‐label multicenter trial of favipiravir treatment of COVID‐19 patients, the purpose of this study was to compare the utility of machine learning (ML)‐based algorithm with that of CT‐determined disease severity score and time from disease onset to CT (i.e., time until CT) in this setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March to May 2020, 32 COVID‐19 patients underwent initial chest CT before enrollment were evaluated in this study. Eighteen patients were randomized to start favipiravir on day 1 (early treatment group), and 14 patients on day 6 of study participation (late treatment group). In this study, percentages of ground‐glass opacity (GGO), reticulation, consolidation, emphysema, honeycomb, and nodular lesion volumes were calculated as quantitative indexes by means of the software, while CT‐determined disease severity was also visually scored. Next, univariate and stepwise regression analyses were performed to determine relationships between quantitative indexes and time until CT. Moreover, patient outcomes determined as viral clearance in the first 6 days and duration of fever were compared for those who started therapy within 4, 5, or 6 days as time until CT and those who started later by means of the Kaplan‐Meier method followed by Wilcoxon's signed‐rank test. RESULTS: % GGO and % consolidation showed significant correlations with time until CT (p < 0.05), and stepwise regression analyses identified both indexes as significant descriptors for time until CT (p < 0.05). When divided all patients between time until CT of 4 days and that of more than 4 days, accuracy of the combined quantitative method (87.5%) was significantly higher than that of the CT disease severity score (62.5%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: ML‐based CT texture analysis is equally or more useful for predicting time until CT for favipiravir treatment on COVID‐19 patients than CT disease severity score.

N2  -  Background: The 2020 pandemic of SARS‐CoV‐2 causing COVID‐19 disease is an unprecedented global emergency. COVID‐19 appears to be a disease with an early phase where the virus replicates, coinciding with the first presentation of symptoms, followed by a later ‘inflammatory’ phase which results in severe disease in some individuals. It is known from other rapidly progressive infections such as sepsis and influenza that early treatment with antimicrobials is associated with a better outcome. The hypothesis is that this holds for COVID‐19 and that early antiviral treatment may prevent progression to the later phase of the disease. Methods: Trial design: Phase IIA randomised, double‐blind, 2 × 2 design, placebo‐controlled, interventional trial. Randomisation: Participants will be randomised 1:1 by stratification, with the following factors: gender, obesity, symptomatic or asymptomatic, current smoking status presence or absence of comorbidity, and if the participant has or has not been vaccinated. Blinding: Participants and investigators will both be blinded to treatment allocation (double‐blind). Discussion: We propose to conduct a proof‐of‐principle placebo‐controlled clinical trial of favipiravir plus or minus nitazoxanide in health workers, their household members and patients treated at the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) facilities. Participants with or without symptomatic COVID‐19 or who tested positive will be assigned to receive favipiravir plus nitazoxanide or favipiravir plus nitazoxanide placebo. The primary outcome will be the difference in the amount of virus (‘viral load’) in the upper respiratory tract after 5 days of therapy. Secondary outcomes will include hospitalization, major morbidity and mortality, pharmacokinetics, and impact of antiviral therapy on viral genetic mutation rate. If favipiravir with nitazoxanide demonstrates important antiviral effects without significant toxicity, there will be a strong case for a larger trial in people at high risk of hospitalization or intensive care admission, for example older patients and/or those with comorbidities and with early disease.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: The GETAFIX trial will test the hypothesis that favipiravir is a more effective treatment for COVID‐19 infection in patients who have early stage disease, compared to current standard of care. This study will also provide an important opportunity to investigate the safety and tolerability of favipiravir, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of this drug and mechanisms of resistance in the context of COVID‐19 infection, as well as the effect of favipiravir on hospitalisation duration and the post COVID‐19 health and psycho‐social wellbeing of patients recruited to the study. TRIAL DESIGN: GETAFIX is an open label, parallel group, two arm phase II/III randomised trial with 1:1 treatment allocation ratio. Patients will be randomised to one of two arms and the primary endpoint will assess the superiority of favipiravir plus standard treatment compared to standard treatment alone. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised to the experimental arm of GETAFIX will receive standard treatment for COVID‐19 at the discretion of the treating clinician plus favipiravir. These patients will receive a loading dose of favipiravir on day 1 of 3600mg (1800mg 12 hours apart). On days 2‐10, patients in the experimental arm will receive a maintenance dose of favipiravir of 800mg 12 hours apart (total of 18 doses). Patients randomised to the control arm of the GETAFIX trial will receive standard treatment for COVID‐19 at the discretion of the treating clinician. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome being assessed in the GETAFIX trial is the efficacy of favipiravir in addition to standard treatment in patients with COVID‐19 in reducing the severity of disease compared to standard treatment alone. Disease severity will be assessed using WHO COVID 10 point ordinal severity scale at day 15 +/‐ 48 hours. All randomised participants will be followed up until death or 60 days post‐randomisation (whichever is sooner). RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomised 1:1 to the experimental versus control arm using computer generated random sequence allocation. A minimisation algorithm incorporating a random component will be used to allocate patients. The factors used in the minimisation will be: site, age (16‐50/51‐70/71+), history of hypertension or currently obsess (BMI>30 or obesity clinically evident; yes/no), 7 days duration of symptoms (yes/no/unknown), sex (male/female), WHO COVID‐19 ordinal severity score at baseline (1/2or 3/4). BLINDING (MASKING): No blinding will be used in the GETAFIX trial. Both participants and those assessing outcomes will be aware of treatment allocation. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): In total, 302 patients will be randomised to the GETAFIX trial: 151 to the control arm and 151 to the experimental arm. There will be an optional consent form for patients who may want to contribute to more frequent PK and PD sampling. The maximum number of patients who will undergo this testing will be sixteen, eight males and eight females. This option will be offered to all patients who are being treated in hospital at the time of taking informed consent, however only patients in the experimental arm of the trial will be able to undergo this testing.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of several repurposed drugs to prevent hospitalisation or death in patients aged 65 or more with recent symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (COVID‐19) and no criteria for hospitalisation. TRIAL DESIGN: Phase III, multi‐arm (5) and multi‐stage (MAMS), randomized, open‐label controlled superiority trial. Participants will be randomly allocated 1:1:1:1:1 to the following strategies: Arm 1: Control arm Arms 2 to 5: Experimental treatment arms Planned interim analyses will be conducted at regular intervals. Their results will be reviewed by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Experimental arms may be terminated for futility, efficacy or toxicity before the end of the trial. New experimental arms may be added if new evidence suggests that other treatments should be tested. A feasibility and acceptability substudy as well as an immunological substudy will be conducted alongside the trial. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria are: 65‐year‐old or more; Positive test for SARS‐CoV‐2 on a nasopharyngeal swab; Symptoms onset within 3 days before diagnosis; No hospitalisation criteria; Signed informed consent; Health insurance. Exclusion criteria are: Inability to make an informed decision to participate (e.g.: dementia, guardianship); Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale ≥7; Long QT syndrome; QTc interval > 500 ms; Heart rate <50/min; Kalaemia >5.5 mmol/L or <3.5 mmol/L; Ongoing treatment with piperaquine, halofantrine, dasatinib, nilotinib, hydroxyzine, domperidone, citalopram, escitalopram, potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme, repaglinide, azathioprine, 6‐mercaptopurine, theophylline, pyrazinamide, warfarin; Known hypersensitivity to any of the trial drugs or to chloroquine and other 4‐aminoquinolines, amodiaquine, mefloquine, glafenine, floctafenine, antrafenine, ARB; Hepatic porphyria; Liver failure (Child‐Pugh stage ≥B); Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²); Dialysis; Hypersentivity to lactose; Lactase deficiency; Abnormalities in galactose metabolism; Malabsorption syndrome; Glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; Symptomatic hyperuricemia; Ileus; Colitis; Enterocolitis; Chronic hepatitis B virus disease. The trial is being conducted in France in the Bordeaux, Corse, Dijon, Nancy, Paris and Toulouse areas as well as in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Participants are recruited either at home, nursing homes, general practices, primary care centres or hospital outpatient consultations. MAIN OUTCOME: The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with an incidence of hospitalisation and/or death between inclusion and day 14 in each arm. RANDOMISATION: Participants are randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to each arm using a web‐based randomisation tool. Participants not treated with an ARB or ACEI prior to enrolment are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the four experimental drugs. Participants already treated with an ARB or ACEI are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the experimental drugs except telmisartan (i.e.: hydroxychloroquine, imatinib, or favipiravir). Randomisation is stratified on ACEI or ARBs treatment at inclusion and on the type of residence (personal home vs. nursing home). BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open‐label trial. Participants, caregivers, investigators and statisticians are not blinded to group assignment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on Clinical Trials.gov on April 22nd, 2020 (Identifier: NCT04356495): and on EudraCT on April 10th, 2020 (Identifier: 2020‐001435‐27). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The four experimental treatments planned in protocol version 1.2 (April 8th, 2020) are: (1) Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, 2 tablets BID on day 0, 2 tablets QD from day 1 to 9; (2) Imatinib 400 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9; (3) Favipiravir 200 mg, 12 tablets BID on day 0, 6 tablets BID from day 1 to 9; (4) Telmisartan 20 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9. The comparator is a complex of vitamins and trace elements (AZINC Forme et Vitalité®), 1 capsule BID for 10 days, for which there is no reason to believe that they are active on the virus. In protocol version 1.2 (April 8th, 2020): People in the control arm will receive a combination of vitamins and trace elements; people in the experimental arms will receive hydroxychloroquine, or favipiravir, or imatinib, or telmisartan. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 1057 participants will be enrolled if all arms are maintained until the final analysis and no additional arm is added. Three successive futility interim analyses are planned, when the number of participants reaches 30, 60 and 102 in the control arm. Two efficacy analyses (interim n°3 and final) will be performed successively. TRIAL STATUS: This describes the Version 1.2 (April 8th, 2020) of the COVERAGE protocol that was approved by the French regulatory authority and ethics committee. The trial was opened for enrolment on April 15th, 2020 in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region (South‐West France). Given the current decline of the COVID‐19 pandemic in France and its unforeseeable dynamic in the coming months, new trial sites in 5 other French regions and in Luxembourg are currently being opened. A revised version of the protocol was submitted to the regulatory authority and ethics committee on June 15th, 2020. It contains the following amendments: (i) Inclusion criteria: age ≥65 replaced by age ≥60; time since first symptoms <3 days replaced by time since first symptoms <5 days; (ii) Withdrawal of the hydroxychloroquine arm (due to external data); (iii) increase in the number of trial sites. FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest of expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol. The study protocol has been reported in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Clinical Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (Additional file 2).

N2  -  We conducted a medical observation from December 2019 when there were no cases and no deaths in America, and just the revelation of this new disease in China. There is still no cure for COVID‐19, a very contagious disease that has a tendency to destroy the immune system and has caused many mysterious complications while vaccination is a long‐term strategy. The complete study involved 100 outpatients from January 2020 to February 2021 who attended our clinic with flu, cold and respiratory symptoms, studied with a panel of 27 viruses and 90 bacteria which has been considered as phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trial for Kunamin® in the United States of America. The sponsor also contracted with CRO APRON in Turkey to conduct the third phase clinical trial for Kunamin® for COVID‐19 inpatients in Kayseri City Hospital. The number of patients planned for randomization was 240, however due to dropouts, we were able to screen 132 patients. Out of these 132 patients, we enrolled a total of 71 patients and randomized 47 patients in the research arm and 24 in the control arm. The median age for COVID‐19 positive patients is 39.6 years old (range of 18‐64 years). Forty (56%) are female and 31 (44%) are male. The demographics include all Caucasians. 3 (4%) out of 71 patients after 40 capsules of Kunamin® were admitted into ICU and intubated, 100% survived. Nineteen (40%) of our patients in the Turkey study had adverse events. Only one patient who completed the 30‐day trial experienced an adverse event. 17 volunteers left the trial by their own will because of gastrointestinal tract related adverse events. All the vital signs were in normal ranges in control and treatment group. No serious adverse events or fatality occurred during the trial. We think the problem with the gastrointestinal tract related adverse events is not caused by Kunamin, but by the standard treatment including at least 6 drugs. In USA our medical observation for 100 patients we used only Kunamin and we found only two minor gastrointestinal tract related adverse events (2%), including one overdose of Kunamin in one patient, and the use of antibiotics in another. According to FDA rules and regulations, it is not allowed to mix a botanical drug with a chemical drug, therefore we should never use Kunamin together with standard treatment which consisted of several drugs. The Ministry of Health in Turkey for safety of COVID‐19 patients required that Kunamin should be used along with hospital's standard treatment. Thanks to grape, rice, soy and edamame which contain polyphenols, resveratrol, isoflavones, genistein are the complex of the protein that contain "KH Good Healthy" cells. US patent 10,195,243 B2, EP patent 3 148 574 B1 and US patent 10,335,446 B2. We suggest that the mechanism of these complex compounds of natural "KH Good Healthy" proteins which contain good healthy cells which are absorbed into the blood stream to send signal to the body to produce new cells that are healthy. It also sends the RNA signal to the DAMAGED, SICK, AND BAD CELLS that triggers that synthesis of good proteins that transform these cells to become GOOD healthy cells. "KH Good Healthy" proteins also send the RNA signal to the other currently undamaged cells to synthesize good proteins to protect them from being DAMAGED, INFECTED and PRONE to DNA and other cellular alterations. Besides the above‐mentioned mechanism, which we believe are the most important, a secondary or contributing mechanism is the effects of polyphenols, an important component of the grape which contribute to produce "KH Good Healthy" cells. Finally, resveratrol may also be involved, as we know that resveratrol is a naturally occurring stilbenoid derivative found in plants and fruits such as grapes (Vitis vinifera). Resveratrol exhibits potent inhibition against MERS‐CoV in vitro and also significantly reduced viral‐induced cell death. It is likely that its anti‐CoV activity is a result of either activation of cellular survival factors and DNA repair in response to DNA damage via activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway or prevention of virus‐induced apoptosis via down‐regulation of FGF‐2 signaling. RAAS products derive from soy, grapes and rice that contain high concentrations of Apo‐A1, Immunoglobulin and Albumin‐like proteins. Unlike traditional human plasma derived therapies that limit the product to one single protein, RAAS Nutritionals supplements contain up to 5,055 proteins. APOA‐1 includes HDL, which is a very important protein for a human being. The next important proteins are immunoglobulin and albumin. RAAS Nutritionals supplements (KUNAMIN®, KHJ®, KHJ‐R™ and KUNAKINMIN®) contain up to 5,055 proteins which include 1,299 proteins (of which 959 are newly found proteins found in grapes (Vitis vinifera), 358 proteins (of which 125 are newly found proteins in soybean (Glycine max), 1,223 total proteins (of which 843 are newly found proteins in edamame (Glycine max) and 2,175 proteins (of which 569 are newly found proteins in rice (Oryza sativa). We have performed an in vitro study by using SDS page to detect the molecular weight of the three main proteins in grape, edamame, soy and rice products that we are looking for: HDL (High Density Lipoprotein) or APOA‐1, Immunoglobulin and Albumin. The in vitro study has shown that these products cover all from the highest molecular weight to the lowest of the protein marker. This proves our analysis of a combination of weight in an SDS page marker. We used the standard of Human APOA1 lays between 35.0 kDa and 25.0 kDA. Grape, soy and rice APOA1 spreads from 66.2 kDa down to 14.4 kDa, that means all these proteins can be found by SDS page. Human Immunoglobulin from plasma lays starting at 45.0 kDa and spread down 25.0 kDa. Grape, soy and rice APOA1 spreads from 45.0 kDa down to 14.4 kDa, that means all these proteins can be found by SDS page. Human albumin which lays between 66.2 kDA and 45.0 kDA. Grape, soy and rice APOA1 spread from 66.2 kDa down to 14.4 kDa, that means all these proteins can be found by SDS page. For albumin, in addition to the SDS page we used the serum protein electrophoresis that showed the high content of alpha‐1, alpha‐2 beta and specially gamma (which is immunoglobulin). For COVID‐19 we have no invitro model, therefore we used H1N1 and H3N2 models to evaluate in vitro inhibitory activity of the 24 RAAS Nutritionals test articles against a panel of viruses. Activity of the articles against IFV. The activity and cytotoxicity results in the influenza virus tests are summarized in Table 5. VX‐787 was used as a reference compound. Dose response curves of the test articles in antiviral and cytotoxicity tests. VX‐787 showed the expected activities in the tests. KH 028, Kunamin, KH 024 and KH 019 showed inhibitory activities against influenza H1N1 with EC50 values between 0.028% and 0.092%. KHMC, KunaFlow, KH 029, KH 021 and KHEGW had EC50 values against influenza H1N1 between 0.146% and 0.985%. Kunaking and KHEGY had EC50 values against influenza H1N1 of 1.112% and 2.685%, respectively. KH 019, KH 028, KH 029, KH 024, Kunamin and KHMC showed inhibitory activities against influenza H3N2 with EC50 values between 0.014% and 0.084%. KunaFlow, Kunaking, KH 021, KHEGW and KHEGY had EC50 values against influenza H3N2 between 0.202% and 1.831%. For COVID‐19 we have no animal model, therefore we used H1N1 model. For in‐vivo model we used H1N1 infected mouse model. We have found that APOA‐1 from human plasma can prevent and treat H1N1 virus. In our study performed at Wuxi Pharma, one of the top ten CRO's in the world, we found that RAAS‐2 (APOA‐1) can prevent 100% of the Bird Flu Epidemiology in Mice. Impressively one‐week preventive treatment with 0.2 ml/0.4 ml/mouse iv/ip QD of RAAS‐2 (APOA‐1) totally protected H1N1‐challenged mice from death and body weight loss till the end of this study. The protection of body weight loss by the preventive treatment of RAAS‐2 (APOA‐1) is even better than that by oseltamivir treatment. However, the therapeutic treatment with 0.2 ml/0.4 ml iv/ip QD of RAAS‐2 only protected one mouse out of 5 mice in the group from death and partial body weight loss of all 5 mice days 2 to 5 post H1N1 infection. Other 4 mice in this group died days 4 to 6 post H1N1 infection. In addition, some of the mice in the RAAS‐2 therapeutic group (G2) had haematuria day 5 post H1N1 challenge and afterward, indicating that the dose used in this group was beyond mouse tolerance in H1N1 challenge status. B cells and T cells are the KH good healthy cells to fight back any virus and its mutations just like Omicron. In our in vitro and in vivo studies, we have found that human APOA1 or grape and rice APOA1 will have the ability to fight back lung cancer as well as other kinds of cancers. We conducted a study at WuXi App Tec titled, Characterization of lymphoid tissues and peripheral blood in nude mouse treated with and without AFCC (Anti Fear of Cancer Cells, a combination of 27 KH human proteins) After whole blood withdrawal, distinct cell lineage was differentiated by cell surface marker proteins. T cells, B cells, activated B cells, mDC, pDC, granulocytes, and monocytes/macrophages were characterized. AFCC treatment didn't affect CD3+T cell population compared with that in nude mouse with tumor and without tumor. After AFCC treatment, B cell population, on the other hand, increased to the similar percentage as seen in nude mouse no tumor and nude naïve ID: APRON 2020‐OK‐01 Effect of Kunamin in SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR Positive Covid‐19 Patients [NCT ID not yet assigned] increased with AFCC treatment. Macrophages and granulocytes decreased after AFCC treatment compared with those in nude mouse with tumor. Nude mouse no tumor and nude mouse with AFCC treatment had similar mDC and pDC percentage. Conclusion: The effect of AFCC on curing tumor through characterizing different cell lineage in lymphoid tissues and peripheral blood in nude mouse was investigated using staining with different marker proteins for distinct cell lineages followed by FACS. T cells, B cells, activated B cells, mDC, pDC, granulocytes, and monocytes/macrophages were characterized in 6 mice. FACS analysis showed that AFCC treatment had the effect on the population of major cell lineages in immune system. Increased CD3+T cell population was found in nude mouse treated with AFCC compared with that in nude mouse with tumor in spleen and lymph nodes. B cells including activated B cells also increased compared with that in nude mice with tumor in spleen, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood. Granulocytes and macrophages, however, were found to decrease after AFCC treatment in peripheral blood and spleen. Taken together, this study suggests the effect of AFCC on curing tumor through changing the population of major cell lineages in immune system, including spleen, lymph nodes and peripheral blood. We conducted a study at WuXi App Tec titled, Characterization of draining lymph nodes and peripheral blood in DIO mice treated with KHJ, KH103 and KHGD (KHJ is a grape product, KH103 is a soy product and KHGD Kieu Hoang Gold label) Results summary, the effects of KHJ, KH103 and KHGD on different cell lineages in lymphoid tissues and peripheral blood in DIO mice were investigated by FACS analysis. T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, MDSCs, granulocytes and macrophages were analyzed. Overall, KH103, KHJ and KHGD treatments showed few effects on T cell lineages, macrophages and granulocytes but reduced the percents of B cells in both peripheral blood and draining lymph nodes. They also elevated the percentages of pDCs in blood and reduced the percentages of mDCs in draining lymph nodes. The causes of the alterations remain to be further investigated.

N2  -  In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of quercetin in combination with remdesivir and favipiravir, were evaluated in severe hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. Our main objective was to assess the ability of quercetin for preventing the progression of the disease into critical phase, and reducing the levels of inflammatory markers related to SARS‐Cov‐2 pathogenesis. Through an open‐label clinical trial, 60 severe cases were randomly divided into control and intervention groups. During a 7‐day period, patients in the control group received antivirals, i.e., remdesivir or favipiravir, while the intervention group was treated with 1000 mg of quercetin daily in addition to the antiviral drugs. According to the results, taking quercetin was significantly associated with partial earlier discharge and reduced serum levels of ALP, q‐CRP, and LDH in the intervention group. Furthermore, although the values were in normal range, the statistical outputs showed significant increase in hemoglobin level and respiratory rate in patients who were taking quercetin. Based on our observations, quercetin is safe and effective in lowering the serum levels of ALP, q‐CRP, and LDH as critical markers involved in COVID‐19 severity. However, according to the non‐significant borderline results in comparing the mortality, the ICU‐admission rate, and the duration of ICU‐admission, further studies can be helpful to compensate the limitations of our study and clarify the therapeutic potential of quercetin in COVID‐19 treatments.

N2  -  Favipiravir is considered a potential treatment for COVID‐19 due its efficacy against different viral infections. We aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of favipiravir in treatment of COVID‐19 mild and moderate cases. It was randomized‐controlled open‐label interventional phase 3 clinical trial [NCT04349241]. 100 patients were recruited from 18th April till 18th May. 50 patients received favipiravir 3200 mg at day 1 followed by 600 mg twice (day 2‐day 10). 50 patients received hydroxychloroquine 800 mg at day 1 followed by 200 mg twice (day 2‐10) and oral oseltamivir 75 mg/12 h/day for 10 days. Patients were enrolled from Ain Shams University Hospital and Assiut University Hospital. Both arms were comparable as regards demographic characteristics and comorbidities. The average onset of SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR negativity was 8.1 and 8.3 days in HCQ‐arm and favipiravir‐arm respectively. 55.1% of those on HCQ‐arm turned PCR negative at/or before 7th day from diagnosis compared to 48% in favipiravir‐arm (p?=?0.7). 4 patients in FVP arm developed transient transaminitis on the other hand heartburn and nausea were reported in about 20 patients in HCQ‐arm. Only one patient in HCQ‐arm died after developing acute myocarditis resulted in acute heart failure. Favipiravir is a safe effective alternative for hydroxychloroquine in mild or moderate COVID‐19 infected patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An effective treatment option is not yet available for SARS‐CoV2, which causes the COVID‐19 pandemic and whose effects are felt more and more every day. Ivermectin is among the drugs whose effectiveness in treatment has been investigated. In this study; it was aimed to investigate the presence of gene mutations that alter ivermectin metabolism and cause toxic effects in patients with severe COVID‐19 pneumonia, and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ivermectin use in the treatment of patients without mutation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with severe COVID19 pneumonia were included in the study, which was planned as a prospective, randomized, controlled, single‐blind phase 3 study. Two groups, the study group and the control group, took part in the study. Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg/day for 5 days in the form of a solution prepared for enteral use added to the reference treatment protocol ‐hydroxychloroquine + favipiravir + azithromycin‐ of patients included in the study group. Patients in the control group were given only reference treatment with 3 other drugs without ivermectin. The presence of mutations was investigated by performing sequence analysis in the mdr1/abcab1 gene with the Sanger method in patients included in the study group according to randomization. Patients with mutations were excluded from the study and ivermectin treatment was not continued. Patients were followed for 5?days after treatment. At the end of the treatment and follow‐up period, clinical response and changes in laboratory parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients, 36 in the study group and 30 in the control group were included in the study. Mutations affecting ivermectin metabolism was detected in genetic tests of six (16.7%) patients in the study group and they were excluded from the study. At the end of the 5‐day follow‐up period, the rate of clinical improvement was 73.3% (22/30) in the study group and was 53.3% (16/30) in the control group (p?=?0.10). At the end of the study, mortality developed in 6 patients (20%) in the study group and in 9 (30%) patients in the control group (p?=?0.37). At the end of the follow‐up period, the average peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) values of the study and control groups were found to be 93.5 and 93.0%, respectively. Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/FiO2 ratios were determined as 236.3?±?85.7 and 220.8?±?127.3 in the study and control groups, respectively. While the blood lymphocyte count was higher in the study group compared to the control group (1698?±?1438 and 1256?±?710, respectively) at the end of the follow‐up period (p?=?0.24); reduction in serum C‐reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D‐dimer levels was more pronounced in the study group (p?=?0.02, p?=?0.005 and p?=?0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings obtained, ivermectin can provide an increase in clinical recovery, improvement in prognostic laboratory parameters and a decrease in mortality rates even when used in patients with severe COVID‐19. Consequently, ivermectin should be considered as an alternative drug that can be used in the treatment of COVID‐19 disease or as an additional option to existing protocols.

N2  -  The study has an adaptive design. Currently estimated sample size is 204 patients. After the enrollment of the first 100 patients (at most 130 screened), the enrollment will be suspended and an interim analysis will be carried out. After analyzing the data of the first 100 randomized patients, a decision will be made about the final sample size. The study will include the following periods: ‐ Screening period lasting up to 2 days (days ‐1‐0). During this period patient's eligibility assessment will be performed; ‐ Treatment period: up to 10 days. Treatment period starts from the end of the screening (days 1‐10) and includes randomization following by a 10 days of standard therapy with or without olokizumab and patient monitoring (laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest computed tomography (CT)); ‐ Short‐term follow‐up period up to 28 days (days 11 through 28). It includes procedures of patient monitoring (laboratory tests, ECG, chest CT) on days 14 (± 2) and 28 (± 2). ‐ Long‐term follow‐up period: up to 180 days (days 29 through 180). Includes telephone contacts with the patient on days 45, 60, 90 and 180. Eligible patients will be randomized to one of 2 treatment groups to receive olokizumab (OKZ) 128 mg i.v. infusion (one or two single doses) against the background of standard therapy, or standard therapy alone. In OKZ group study drug olokizumab 128 mg is administered as a single intravenous infusion. A comprehensive assessment of the clinical and laboratory response is performed daily within 5 days (120 hours) after the first injection. If there is no response to therapy or the response is insufficient, the repeated dose of OKZ, 128 mg, is administered. As standard anti‐inflammatory therapy, patients in both groups will receive baricitinib (at the standard recommended dose of 4 mg / 1 time per day, for 7 days) and low doses of glucocorticosteroids (dexamethasone at doses of 4‐20 mg / day or methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 mg / kg / intravenous injection every 12 hours). With an observed clinical deterioration (fever increase, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, the appearance / increase in the need for oxygen support) after repeated infusion of OKZ in the main group (at least 24 hours from the first infusion started), or after 24 hours or more from the start of therapy in the comparison group, the patient is considered "not responding" to therapy and requiring another anti‐inflammatory treatment regimens. Standard therapy also includes etiotropic therapy for COVID‐19, as well as symptomatic and anticoagulant therapy. Etiotropic therapy. Favipiravir will be used in recommended dosage regimens according to temporary guidelines "Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection (COVID‐19)" of the Ministry of Health of Russian Federation. Patients who have started etiotropic therapy with favipiravir or remdesivir prior to randomization will continue the initiated treatment. Сlinical status will be assessed daily in the first 10 days, then on days 14, 21, 28, 45, 60, 90 and 180, vital signs ‐ three times daily in the first 5 days, once daily on days 6‐10, then on days 14 and 28, chest CT ‐ on days 7, 14 and 28; laboratory parameters ‐ on days 1 ‐ 5, 10, 14, 28. On day 7 primary endpoint of patient's clinical recovery (defined as score of 3 or less on a 10‐point ordinal scale of clinical improvement) will be assessed. The last patient's visit to the study site will be the visit on Day 28. On Days 45, 60, 90 and 180 the phone follow‐up will be performed. In olokizumab group, eligible subjects will be selected to participate in pharmacokinetic analysis. Blood samples for the evaluation of olokizumab pharmacokinetics will be taken before the infusion of olokizumab and in 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, 120 h, 144 h, 168 h, 192 h, 216 h, 240 h, 336 h and 672 h after the first administration of the drug (since the start of infusion). Expected study duration for each patient will be 182 (± 2) days, including screening periods (2 days), therapy and short‐term follow‐up (28 (± 2) days), and long‐term extended follow‐up (152 (± 2) 2 days).

N2  -  Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) is an infectious disease due to SARS‐COV‐2. Patients with risk factors are vulnerable to severe morbidity and mortality. Favipiravir (FPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are considered possible COVID‐19 treatments. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of FPV compared to HCQ in patients with COVID‐19 as the standard of care approved by the national protocol there. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study on patients with COVID‐19 who were administered either FPV or HCQ at King Faisal Medical Complex, Taif, Saudi Arabia, from June 2020 to August 2020. Results: In total, 508 patients were included in the analysis. Patients were categorized into three groups by medication. Patients enrolled in this study were 244 (55.8%) on FPV, 193 (44.2%) on HCQ and 71 (13.81%) on neither medication. Patients who received FPV had higher age and greater comorbidity. Most of the patients were discharged on day 14 (n = 303, 59.6%), 26 (36.6%) in neither med, 154 (63.1%) in FPV and 123 (63.7%) in HCQ groups with significant difference between groups (P < 0.0001). Mortality rate was 8.2% (n = 20) in FPV and 7.3% (n = 14) in HCQ groups with significant difference between groups (P = 0.048). Regarding drug safety, 19.7% of patients treated with FPV vs 7.8% HCQ have adverse effects with significant difference between groups (P < 0.0001). Most of the side effects were increase ALT and AST. Meanwhile, prolonged Q‐T interval was reported only in the HCQ group (2.6%). From Cox regression modeling, only mechanical ventilation due to Covid 19 was predictive for mortality (HR: 16.598, 95% CI: 7.095? 38.828, P < 0.0001). Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in the prediction of discharge of FPV (vs HCQ) (HR: 0.933, 95% CI: 0.729?1.195, P = 0.5843), predictors of mortality were HCQ (vs FPV) (HR: 2.3, 95% CI: 0.994?5.487, P = 0.0518). Kaplan?Meier survival curves showed improved survival time and discharged time among patients in the HCQ versus FPV group with an insignificant difference between them (P = 0.85, P = 0.06, respectively). Conclusion: The present study concluded that FPV and HCQ showed comparable efficacy in decrease mortality and oxygen requirements. FPV likely has a more favorable safety profile regarding cardiac toxicity. A randomized clinical trial with large patient numbers is recommended to confirm the effectiveness of these drugs in COVID‐19 patients.

N2  -  In this trial, the investigators want to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of Favipiravir and Hydroxychloroquine as potential therapy for moderate and severe cases with COVID ‐19. Favipiravir which is a new type of RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor has activity against influenza virus, and Hydroxychloroquine, an analogue of chloroquine, has a clinical safety profile better than that of chloroquine and allows higher daily dose, Chloroquine is a widely used antimalarial that was found to be a potential broad‐spectrum antiviral. There is an urgent need to explore therapeutic options for SARS‐CoV‐2 in order to face the pandemic. The selected combination was based on limited evidence clinically and in vitro on the efficacy of the Favipiravir and Hydroxychloroquine in SARS‐CoV‐2. The two medications were listed in many guidelines as treatment options and ongoing trials assessing their efficacy and safety. Thus, the investigators want to prove the effectiveness of the combination as therapy.

N2  -  FLARE is a phase IIA randomised, double‐blind, 2x2 factorial placebo‐controlled, interventional trial in which 240 participants, aged 18 years (≥ 18 years) to 70 years old inclusive will be recruited. Participants will be key workers and their household members who have developed the early symptoms of COVID‐19 within the first 5 days, or tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 within the first 7 days of symptom onset, or not presenting symptoms but tested positive within the last 48 hours (date/time of test must be within 48 hours of enrolment). Eligible participants will be randomised 1:1:1:1 to receive one of the following combinations: Favipiravir + Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (both active); Favipiravir active + Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) placebo; Favipiravir placebo + Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) active; Favipiravir placebo + Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) placebo; All participants will be enrolled and followed up for 28 days. A saliva sample for virological analysis and safety blood samples will be collected at baseline, as well as a diagnostic nose and throat swab, if the participant hasn't been tested for COVID‐19 yet. Following randomisation, participants will take trial medication for 7 days and during this period will take a daily saliva sample and complete a symptoms diary including four daily temperature measurements. Participants will have two follow‐up visits at Day 7 and Day 14 where they will be assessed and undergo blood tests for toxicity and pharmacokinetic assessment (on Day 7 only) and provide stool samples. Participants will have a telephone follow up three (3) weeks after their last day of treatment (Day 7) and further information will be collected through a questionnaire.

N2  -  Recent study showed that, coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2 enters host cells via ligation of its spike protein (S glycoprotein) with host cell ACE2 receptor that is primed by transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), an airway and alveolar cell serine protease. ACE2‐ and TMPRSS2‐mediated cell entry can be blocked by protease inhibitor antiviral drugs. Virus replication and assembly can be inhibited by antiviral drugs targeting viral RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Previous studies showed that diverse viruses, including Ebola virus, SARS‐coronavirus (SARS‐CoV), MERS‐coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) and influenza virus employ host cell proteases for activation of their envelope glycoproteins. Cleavage and activation of the spike protein of SARS‐CoV that is required for membrane fusion and host cell entry is mediated by TMPRSS2 protease. Nelfinavir was developed as an anti‐human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor. Also, it was reported that Nelfinavir strongly inhibiteds SARS CoV virus replication and cytopathic effects in cell culture. Recently, Nelfinavir, Inhibits SARS CoV‐2 Spike‐mediated cell fusion in vitro. Moreover, Nelfinavir was shown to have a highest binding affinity to SARS CoV‐2 3CL protease enzyme. It possess a negative dock energy value of (‐ 7.54 kcal mol‐1) which was the best compared to other potential protease inhibitors including Lopinavir, ritonavir, and Remdesivir. Previous study found that, Nelfinavir was effective against feline coronavirus in cats causing Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) which is similar to SARS in humans. In addition, Nelfinavir has many other potential favourable effects beyond the antiviral role including antifibrotic effect and inducer of autophagy which may play role in host defence against viral infection. Favipiravir is a broad spectrum antiviral compound that selectively and potently inhibits the RdRP of influenza virus and many other RNA viruses. Favipiravir induces lethal RNA transversion mutations, thereby producing a nonviable virus phenotype. Favipiravir has viral inhibitory effect against all types of influenza virus including resistant strains in vitro. Favipiravir has antiviral activity against various viruses, including coronaviruses in vitro. Favipiravir has antiviral activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 in infected Vero E6 cells reported with high concentrations of the drug. Clinically, Favipiravir is licensed for the treatment of influenza viral infection in Japan and showed a favourable outcome with better mortality in Ebola virus infected patients. Recently, Favipiravir shows some evidence of efficacy, as indicated by 7 day's clinical recovery rate, time of fever reduction, and cough relief in COVID‐19 patients. Recent study on triple combination of interferon beta‐1b, lopinavir‐ritonavir, and ribavirin was found to be safe and superior to lopinavir‐ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID‐19. The rational of the use of the two antiviral drugs Nelfinavir and Favipiravir combination is to inhibit TMPRSS2 serine protease and prevent cell entry of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Nelfinavir) as well as inhibition of virus replication and assembly by Favipiravir.

N2  -  Introduction: Favipiravir, a broad‐spectrum antiviral agent, acts by inhibiting RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase. It is approved in India in the management of mild‐moderate COVID‐19. It has shown potent in vitro activity against SARS‐CoV‐2. It has a wide therapeutic safety margin indicated by a wide CC50/EC50 ratio for a high dose. It has shown promising results in clinical studies conducted in China, Russia, Japan, and India. Treatment guidelines from many countries and some states from India have included favipiravir in the treatment protocol. A recently published phase III trial on favipiravir in India has shown early clinical resolution and acceptable safety in mild‐moderate COVID‐19 infection. Objectives: The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of favipiravir in moderate COVID‐19 patients, while the secondary objective was to determine the safety of favipiravir. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed medical records of favipiravir‐treated COVID‐19 cases from 3 centers to capture key details of moderate COVID‐19 patients including medical history, symptoms, supportive treatment, and clinical outcome. The protocol of the study was approved by Independent Ethics Committee. Results: Data from medical records of 193 patients was available for analysis, including 54 patients of moderate severity. The mean age was 59.94 ± 13.18 years. 58.92% of the patients were male. Hypertension (78.57%) and diabetes (55.35%) were the two most prevalent comorbidities. Majority (85.71%) of patients had at least one comorbidity, while 66.07% had ≥2 comorbidities. Mean SpO2 was 92.83 ± 1.88% with a median of 93% (90‐98). The most common clinical features were fever (87.5%), cough (80.35%), dyspnoea (57.14%) and myalgia (48.12%). The mean CRP was 65.58 ± 34.74 with a median of 57.85 (1.20 to 151) and the mean d‐Dimer was 1082.95 ± 1129.7 with a median of 815 (156‐7435). Favipiravir has been used for an average duration of 12.30 ± 3.99 days, with median duration of 14 days (1‐14 days). The rate of clinical improvement on days 3, 5, 7 and 10 was 30.35%, 75%, 89.29% and 96.42%. Fever and dyspnoea were fully resolved by day 7 in all enrolled patients, while myalgia was resolved by day 10 in all patients and cough was resolved by day 10 in 97.77% of patients. Corticosteroid was used in 37.5% patients. Oxygen requirements on days 3, 5, 7 and 10 were 28.57%, 14.28%, 8.92% and 7.14% patients respectively. Progression of the disease was seen in 10.71% of cases. Overall favipiravir was well tolerated with few commonly reported adverse events like diarrhoea and nausea, which does not require drug discontinuation. 91.07% patients and physician rated favipiravir as good or very good on global assessment scale. Discussions: An open‐labeled nonrandomized study1 from China compared the effect of favipiravir (day 1: 1,600 mg twice daily; days 2‐14: 600 mg twice daily) vs lopinavir/ritonavir (day 1‐14: 400/100 twice daily) in the treatment of COVID‐19. Compared with the lopinavir/ritonavir arm, however, patients in the favipiravir arm showed a statistically significant shorter median length of time to viral clearance (4 vs 11 days, p < 0.001), improvement in chest CT findings at day 14 after randomization (91.4 vs 62.2%, p = 0.004), and lower incidence of adverse effects (11.43 vs 55.56%, p < 0.001). Chen et al.2 had conducted a prospective, open‐label multicentric trial in China to compare two treatment arms in the management of clinically confirmed COVID‐19 (maximum duration of symptom onset before randomization: 12 days). Post hoc analysis demonstrated that favipiravir‐treated patients showed a trend toward clinical improvement at day 7 among those with moderate COVID‐19 (71.43 vs 55.86%, 95% CI: 0.0271 to 0.2843, p = 0.0199) and earlier resolution of fever and cough (p < 0.0001). A Japanese observational study group recorded the details of hospitalized COVID‐19 patients in Japan to assess the safety and efficacy of favipiravir. In >90% of cases, favipiravir was administered at a dose of 1,800 mg orally on day 1 followed by 800 mg twice daily on subsequent days. The median duration of therapy was 11 days. Rates of clinical improvement at 7 and 14 days were 73.8 and 87.8%, 66.6 and 84.5%, and 40.1 and 60.3% for mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. Thus, the vast majority of patients with mild and moderate disease recovered from the illness. Conclusion: Approximately 90% clinical resolution rate in moderate COVID‐19 patients in real‐world settings supports its role in the management of hospitalized patients. Reduction in the oxygen requirement highlights its protective role against disease progression. Overall favipiravir was found to be effective and safe in the management of moderate COVID‐19.

N2  -  Favipiravir has demonstrated efficacy against the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus in several preliminary studies. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for treatment of mild to moderate COVID‐19 in outpatients and hospitalized patients. We conducted an open‐label, randomized, active‐controlled trial of a generic form of favipiravir in patients with COVID‐19 confirmed by PCR‐test. Eligible patients (18‐60 years) after stratification were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive either favipiravir (1800 mg BID on day 1, followed by 800 mg BID for up to 9 days), or standard of care (SOC) treatment (umifenovir + intranasal interferon alpha‐2b, or hydroxychloroquine) for up to 10 days. The co‐primary outcomes were the time to clinical improvement and the time to viral clearance. Among 190 patients assessed for eligibility 168 were randomized to favipiravir (n=112) or to SOC (n=56) group. The median time to clinical improvement was 6.0 days (IQR 4.0; 9.3) in the favipiravir group and 10.0 (IQR 5.0; 21.0) days in the SOC group; the median difference was 4 days (HR 1.63; 95% CI 1.14‐2.34; P=0.007). The statistically significant difference in the median time to viral clearance was observed only for hospitalized patients: 3.0 (IQR 3.0; 3.0) days in the favipiravir group vs. 5.0 (IQR 4.5; 5.5) days in the SOC group (HR 2.11; 95% CI 1.04‐4.31; P=0.038). The rate of viral elimination on Day 5 in the favipiravir group was significantly higher than in SOC group: 81.2% vs. 67.9% (RR 1.22; 05% CI 1.00‐1.48; P=0.022). The rate of clinical improvement on Day 7 in the favipiravir group was 1.5‐fold higher than in SOC group: 52.7% vs. 35.8% (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.02‐2.22; P=0.020). Favipiravir was well‐tolerated and the most common adverse reactions were asymptomatic hyperuricemia, transient elevation of ALT & AST, and mild gastrointestinal disorders. Favipiravir was superior to the SOC in shortening the time to clinical improvement in patients with mild to moderate COVID‐19.

N2  -  This study compared the pharmacokinetics and safety of favipiravir oral solution with those of tablet formulations, which were agents repurposed to treat nonsevere coronavirus disease 2019 in Thailand. In an open‐label, single‐dose, randomized, crossover study, 24 healthy subjects under fasting conditions were randomly assigned to a single dose of 200 mg of favipiravir, either as an oral solution of 200 mg/15 mL (test product) or a tablet (reference product), separated by a 7‐day washout period. Fifteen plasma samples were collected over 12 hours after drug administration. Plasma favipiravir levels were quantified using in‐house developed ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. The test/reference geometric mean ratio along with 90%CI for the maximum plasma concentration, area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC) to the time of the last quantifiable concentration, and AUC after single‐dose administration, extrapolated to infinity were 115.3% (90%CI, 107.7%‐123.3%), 100.4% (90%CI, 96.9%‐104.0%), and 100.4% (90%CI, 96.8%‐104.2%), respectively. These results were within the predefined acceptance criteria for bioequivalence (80.0%‐125.0%). No adverse events were observed in either group. The oral solution formulation could offer the advantage of easier swallowing in broader patient groups.

N2  -  Stage I ‐ Main Study: All the eligible patients will be randomized to receive either favipiravir + supportive care or placebo + supportive care. The treatment duration with the IMP will be for a period of 10 consecutive days. If the patient is discharged before Day 10, the patient will be required to continue the remainder of the treatment course of the assigned IMP at home. Patients in both the groups will receive supportive care, as appropriate. The duration of supportive care will be based upon Investigator's judgement and as per individual patient's requirement. The study data collection period will be up to 28 (+2) days. Day 10 will be considered as the End of treatment (EOT) assessment. 1. If the patient remains in the hospital until Day 10, the EOT will be performed at the site and all the scheduled assessments for Day 10 will be performed 2. If the patient is discharged before Day 10, the EOT can be performed either as an onsite visit or will be performed at the patient's home : 1. On‐site visit: If the patient is able to visit the hospital on Day 10, procedures for an unscheduled visit will be performed. OR 2. At home: If the patient is unable to visit the hospital for the EOT, study nurse or phlebotomist will visit the patient at his/her residence to collect blood sample for safety assessments. A telephonic follow up will be performed to enquire on treatment emergent AEs experienced, concomitant medication and COVID‐19 associated symptom for assessment of clinical relapse. Day 28 will be considered the end of study visit. If patient is discharged from the hospital before Day 28, the assessments mentioned in the end of study visit (Day 28) will be performed before the patient is discharged. After discharge, telephonic follow up will be performed on Day 10 (applicable only for patients who are discharged earlier than Day 10 and if patients are unable to visit the site for EOT on Day 10), Day 14, Day 21 and Day 28. The telephonic follow up will be as applicable for the individual patient, depending upon the actual day when (s)he is discharged. A 2‐day window period is allowed for telephonic follow up. In case the patient remains admitted in the hospital beyond Study Day 28, the end of study assessments will be performed for the patient on Day 28 (+2) days. Stage I of the study will be completed when the 'Day 28' assessment is completed either as an in‐patient assessment if the patient is still hospitalized, or as a telephonic follow up assessment if the patients are discharged earlier to Day 28. Once all the patients complete the Stage I of the study, the database would be locked, and analysis will be performed. Stage II ‐ Extended Follow Up: All the patients will be followed up for AEs or for 'clinical relapse' of COVID 19. Two telephonic follow up assessments will be performed on Day 42 and Day 60. An additional visit to the hospital (for further assessment) may be scheduled for such patients, if required.

N2  -  COVID‐19 stands for 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019‐nCoV which is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), & hence named as SARS‐CoV‐2. It has been revealed that SARS‐CoV‐2 has a genome sequence that is 75%‐80% identical to that of SARS‐CoV. Since its first discovery in Wuhan, China in late December, it has now become a pandemic disease claiming more than nine hundred forty‐five thousand deaths world‐wide so far. Majority of the patients are asymptomatic or mild symptomatic, & recovery without any treatment. While there is disproportionately higher mortality among elderly & people with co‐morbidities like hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart disease or any immunocompromised status. Recently, several regimens have been tried as antiviral medicine. Among these medicines, Favipiravir is considered a broad‐spectrum antiviral with spectrum of activity noted against a wide range of RNA viruses namely Influenza, West Nile virus, Yellow fever virus, Food & mouth virus, Flavivirus, Arenavirus, Bunyavirus & Alpha virus. In the USA, Japan & China, it has been approved for use in resistant Influenza. Regarding use of Favipiravir in COVID19, there have been some studies with limited data. The earlier Chinese study that compared between Favipiravir (35 patients) versus Lopinavir/Ritonavir (45 patients) among mild to moderate cases showed a trend towards earlier improvement in CT scan & quicker viral clearance in Favipiravir arm with lesser side effects comparatively. Another randomized clinical trial in China conducted on patients with COVID19 pneumonia (moderate) failed to demonstrate a significant difference in clinical recovery rate at day 7 between Favipiravir (116 patients) versus Umifenovir (112 patients) however, Favipiravir was associated with earlier relief of pyrexia & cough in comparison Another multicenter, open label, randomized phase II/III trial conducted in Russia on moderate COVID19 infection comparing Favipiravir against standard of care in total 60 patients randomized into three treatment groups with 20 patients each: Favipiravir 1600/600 mg, Favipiravir 1800/800 mg, or Standard of care (which included, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine versus lopinavir/ritonavir versus no etiotropic treatment) concluded that Favipiravir enabled viral clearance in 62.5% patients within 4 days with good safety data, no matter which dosing was used. There has been an observational study on 2141 patients in Japan that showed good recovery among mild (not requiring oxygen), moderate case (requiring oxygen) or younger patients (59 years or younger) whereas poor prognosis in severe (requiring mechanical ventilation or ECMO) or older patients (60 years or older). The most common adverse events were hyperuricemia (335 patients; 15.52%) followed by liver injury or liver function test abnormalities (159 patients; 7.37%) in this study. Similarly, the open label randomized , multicenter clinical trial was conducted in 150 patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir plus standard supportive care ( Favipiravir treatment arm, versus standard supportive care alone ( control arm ) across seven clinical sites in India. It was evaluated among mild to moderate patients, randomized within a 48 hours window of testing RT‐PCR positive for COVID‐19 . The patients received Favipiravir tables of 3,600 mg (1,800 mg BID) (Day 1) + 1,600 mg (800 mg BID) (Day 2 or later) for up to maximum of 14 days , along with standard supportive care . The results from this Phase 3 trial conducted by Glenmark showed numerical improvement for the primary efficacy endpoint with 28.6% faster viral clearance in the overall population (Hazard Ratio 1.367 [95%CI 0.944,1.979]; p=0.129). Additionally , 69.8 % of patients in the Favipiravir treatment arm achieved clinical cure by Day 4, which was statistically significant compared to 44.9% observed in the control group (p=0.019). Likewise, Glenmark's Favipiravir was well tolerated with no serious adverse events or death in the Favipiravir treated arm but adverse events were reported in 26 patients in Favipiravir treatment arm. However, adverse events were mild to moderate and none led to drug discontinuation and dosing adjustments. This trial demonstrated statistically significant faster time to clinical improvement with Favipiravir treatment in Mild to moderate COVID‐19 patients compared to the control group. Additionally, An open‐label, nonrandomized, before‐after controlled study was conducted in an isolation ward of the national clinical research center for infectious diseases at Shenzhen, China.35 patients was enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. From 30 January to 14 February 2020, laboratory‐confirmed patients with COVID‐19 were consecutively screened, and eligible patients were included in the FPV arm of the study. Patients who had initially been treated with antiviral therapy with LPV/RTV from 24 January to 30 January 2020 were screened, and eligible patients were included in the control arm of the study. The dose was 1600 mg twice daily on Day 1 and 600 mg twice daily on Days 2‐14. LPV/RTV (AbbVie Inc., 200 mg/50 mg per tablet) were given orally. The dose was LPV 400 mg/RTV 100 mg twice daily. Both FPV and LPV/RTV were continued until the viral clearance was confirmed or until 14 d had passed. For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. A shorter viral clearance time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (median (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5‐9) d versus 11 (8‐13) d, P < 0.001). The FPV arm also showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with the control arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P = 0.004). After adjustment for potential confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly higher improvement rate in chest imaging. Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with faster viral clearance. In addition, fewer adverse events were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm.In this open‐label before‐after controlled study, FPV showed better therapeutic responses on COVID‐19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance.These preliminary clinical results provide useful information of treatments for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Doses of Favipiravir ranged widely across studies, from 400 mg up to 6000 mg loading doses, with the more common regimens being 1200 mg per day, split into twice or three times daily doses. 494 Studies were screened, 55 studies assessed for full text eligibility, 29 studies were included. Hyperuricemia was shown as the side effects.

N2  -  The clinical picture of 2019‐nCoV disease is in a broad spectrum, which includes asymptomatic infection, a mild upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory failure, and even severe viral pneumonia with death. Although the mortality rate is not yet clear, the reported case‐fatality risk was 11‐14% during the initial studies which included patients with severe disease. The overall case fatality rate was reported as approximately 2%. In addition, most cases have resulted in a pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen therapy and ventilator support. The alarming levels of spread and severity of COVID‐19 caused a global emergency and this outbreak has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The investigational product Favipiravir is an antiviral drug against RNA viruses and has been stated as effective for the treatment of COVID‐19, first emerged from China, in various clinical studies. In February 2020, Favipiravir was used for the clinical treatment of COVID‐19, has been shown to be more effective than the lopinavir / ritonavir combination in 80 people. In recent researches, the drug favipiravir is suggested that it may induce recovery in a short time in patients with COVID‐19‐mild type and decrease the treatment duration from 11 days to 4 days. The investigational product hydroxychloroquine sulfate is a 4‐ aminoquinoline derivative and widely used for the treatment of many rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus in addition to its antimalarial effects. In vitro studies reported that hydroxychloroquine sulfate may be effective against many viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2 in many in vitro experiments. Additionally, preliminary results of limited number of studies have been revealed that hydroxychloroquine sulfate reduces virus load and induces improvement in patients with COVID‐19. This agent has been also suggested to be used in COVID‐19 prophylaxis. Until now, there is no official report on whether hydroxychloroquine combined with favipiravir show clinical activity against the new coronavirus, COVID‐19, in Turkey. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir in the treatment of Turkey population with COVID‐19. This study designed as an open‐label, multicenter, parallel‐group, randomized, phase III clinical drug trial. A total of 1000 subjects aged between 18 to 70 years with symptoms and complaints consistent with possible or confirmed COVID‐19 observed within the last 5 days and meet all eligibility criteria will participate in the study. This study will be conducted in 14 sites.

N2  -  Favipiravir is an antiviral agent whose indication in Japan is currently for influenza infections. There were earlier reports from China suggesting its promising potential for benefit in the treatment of COVID‐19. This is an open label randomized controlled clinical trial was designed to verify the potential efficacy and safety of favipiravir in the management of patients with mild to moderate COVID‐19 compared to best supportive care. This study will look at the potential of using this repurposed oral agent in managing non‐severe cases of COVID19. Consenting patients admitted to hospitals or isolation/quarantine facilities will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio to either favipiravir versus best supportive care. Patients will be examined daily and will have xray and nasopharyngeal swabs every 3‐4 days for close monitoring.

N2  -  The clinical picture of COVID‐19 disease is in a broad spectrum, which includes asymptomatic infection, a mild upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory failure, and even severe viral pneumonia with death. The alarming levels of spread and severity of COVID‐19 caused a global emergency and this outbreak has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Coronavirus entry into host cells is an important determinant of viral infectivity and pathogenesis. SARS‐CoV S1 contains a receptor‐binding domain (RBD) that specifically recognizes angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor. SARS‐CoV spike needs to be proteolytically activated at the S1/S2 boundary, such that S1 dissociates and S2 undergoes a dramatic structural change. These SARS‐CoV entry‐activating proteases include cell surface protease TMPRSS2 and lysosomal proteases cathepsins. These features of SARS‐CoV entry contribute to its rapid spread and severe symptoms and high fatality rates of infected patients. Ribavirin is a guanosine analog that interferes with the replication of RNA and DNA viruses. Ribavirin was used during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in combination with corticosteroids, which have an anti‐inflammatory effect. Favipiravir is a substrate for viral RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and showed anti‐influenza virus activity. Favipiravir is effective against other RNA viruses, poliovirus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus and evaluated and developed as a broad spectrum anti‐RNA virus drug, including lethal RNA virus infections. According to national guidelines, Favipiravir treatment is applied to COVID‐19 infection in Turkey. The main purpose of this study is to obtain efficacy and safety data for ribavirin and favipiravir in the Turkish patient cohort diagnosed with COVID‐19. This study designed as an open‐label, multicenter, parallel‐group, randomized, phase II/III clinical drug trial. This study will be conducted in 4 sites.

N2  -  Pre‐screening is assessing patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screening was carried out to assess whether the subjects met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Randomization was performed to determine the study drug allocation. The research subjects were inpatients at selected hospitals and at the time of recruitment, the time was called D1. The next day is called D2 and so on Follow‐up will be carried out from the first day of recruitment, taking medication up to a maximum of 19 days for test drugs and 11 days for SoC drugs. Recording of clinical and laboratory manifestations will be carried out from recruitment until the patient returns from the hospital. All results will be recorded in a case report form, and if a case of clinical and laboratory manifestations is found to be severe, it will be written on the adverse case report form and reported immediately according to standard GCP procedures. Subjects may also drop out of the study due to discontinuation of follow‐up or a protocol violation

N2  -  Favipiravir is an oral broad‐spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase that is approved for treatment of influenza in Japan. We conducted a prospective, randomized, open‐label, multicenter trial of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID‐19 at 25 hospitals across Japan. Eligible patients were adolescents and adults admitted with COVID‐19 who were asymptomatic or mildly ill and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to early or late favipiravir therapy (the same regimen starting on day 6 instead of day 1). The primary endpoint was viral clearance by day 6. The secondary endpoint was change in viral load by day 6. Exploratory endpoints included time to defervescence and resolution of symptoms. Eighty‐nine patients were enrolled, of whom 69 were virologically evaluable. Viral clearance occurred within 6 days in 66.7% and 56.1% of the early and late treatment groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.76‐2.62). Of 30 patients who had a fever (≥37.5°C) on day 1, time to defervescence was 2.1 days and 3.2 days in the early and late treatment groups (aHR, 1.88; 95%CI, 0.81‐4.35). During therapy, 84.1% developed transient hyperuricemia. Favipiravir did not significantly improve viral clearance as measured by RT‐PCR by day 6 but was associated with numerical reduction in time to defervescence. Neither disease progression nor death occurred to any of the patients in either treatment group during the 28‐day participation (Japan Registry of Clinical Trials jRCTs041190120).

N2  -  Objective. Тo evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir (Areplivir) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and compare it with recommended standard therapy. Patients and methods. Two hundred men and women aged between 18 and 80 years with COVID‐19 were randomized into this study. The experimental group included patients who received favipiravir, whereas the control group comprised patients who received causal therapy in accordance with the latest version of the temporary methodical recommendations of the Ministry of Health of Russia ‘Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of coronavirus infection (COVID‐19).’ The efficacy and safety of therapy were evaluated by assessing clinical improvement using the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement, clinical and laboratory parameters, findings of chest computed tomography (CT), and elimination of SARS‐CoV‐2. We also analyzed the frequency and type of adverse events, need for invasive and non‐invasive ventilation, and death rates. Results. Our analysis has demonstrated significant benefits of favipiravir over standard therapy in terms of the time to clinical improvement (in the experimental group it was 4 days shorter on average), time to recovery, frequency of recovery after 10 days (44% of patients from the experimental group and 10% of patients from the control group had no clinical signs of the disease at this time‐point), and frequency of virus elimination by day 10 of therapy. Treatment with favipiravir was associated with a significant improvement in the lung condition (according to CT), normalization of laboratory parameters, and saturation level. Favipiravir has demonstrated a good safety profile similar to that of standard therapy. There was no difference in the frequency of adverse events between the experimental and control groups. Conclusion. The use of favipiravir for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection reduced the time to clinical improvement by 4 days on average compared to standard therapy, ensured improvement of the lung condition (according to CT scans), and facilitated virus elimination in more than 90% of patients, thereby promoting faster recovery. Favipiravir had a good safety profile and was well tolerated by patients. This treatment regimen was shown to be effective, sufficient, and clinically reasonable to achieve good outcomes. Timely initiation of therapy with favipiravir (Areplivir) improves disease prognosis and reduces the global socioeconomic burden of the current pandemic.

N2  -  Introduction A novel coronavirus, designated SARS‐CoV‐2, caused an international outbreak of a respiratory illness, termed COVID‐19 in December 2019. There is a lack of specific therapeutic agents based on evidence for this novel coronavirus infection; however, several medications have been evaluated as a potential therapy. Therapy is required to treat symptomatic patients and decrease the virus carriage duration to limit the communitytransmission. Methods and analysis We hypothesise that patients with mild COVID‐19 treated with favipiravir will have a shorter duration of time to virus clearance than the control group. The primary outcome is to evaluate the effect of favipiravir on the timing of the PCR test conversion from positive to negative within 15 days after starting the medicine. Adults (>18 years, men or nonpregnant women, diagnosed with mild COVID‐19 within 5 days of disease onset) are being recruited by physicians participating from the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs and the Ministry of Health ethics committee approved primary healthcare centres. This double‐blind, randomised trial comprises three significant parts: screening, treatment and a follow‐up period. The treating physician and patients are blinded. Eligible participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the therapy group (favipiravir) or a control group (placebo) with 1800 mg by mouth two times per day for the first day, followed by 800 mg two times per day for 4‐7 days. Serial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples are obtained on day 1 (5 days before therapy). On day5±1 day, 10±1 day, 15±2 days, extra nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR COVID‐19 samples are requested. The primary analysis population for evaluating both the efficacy and safety outcomes will be a modified intention to treat population. Anticipating a 10% dropout rate, we expect to recruit 288 subjects per arm. The results assume that the hazard ratio is constant throughout the study and that the Cox proportional hazard regression is used to analyse the data. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre Institutional Review Board (28 April 2020) and the Ministry of Health Institutional Review Board (1 July 2020). Protocol details and any amendments will be reported to https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04464408. The results will be published in peer‐reviewed journals. Trial registration number National Clinical Trial Registry (NCT04464408).

N2  -  Background: Administration of systemic corticosteroids is a key strategy for improving COVID‐19 outcomes. However, evidence is lacking on combination therapies of antiviral agents and systemic corticosteroids. Aim: To investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of favipiravir and methylprednisolone in preventing respiratory failure progression in COVID‐19 patients with non‐critical respiratory failure Methods: We conducted a multicenter, open‐label, singlearm phase II study. The dose and duration of the study treatment is shown in Figure. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) or those who met the criteria for tracheal intubation within 14 days of the study treatment initiation (MVCTI‐14). Results: Sixty‐nine patients were enrolled and underwent the study treatment. of them, the MVCTI‐14 proportion was 29.2% (90% confidence interval 20.1‐39.9, p = 0.200). The proportion of patients who required MV or who died within 30 days was 26.2%, and 30‐day mortality was 4.9%. The most significant risk factor for MVCTI‐14 was a smoking history (odds ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2‐14.2). The most common grade 3‐4 treatment‐related adverse event was hyperglycemia, which was observed in 21.7%. Conclusions: The MVCTI‐14 proportion did not reach a favorable level in the clinical trial setting with the threshold of 35%. However, the proportion of MV or death within 30 days was 26.6%, which might be close to the findings (28.1%) of the Recovery trial, which showed the efficacy of dexamethasone for COVID‐19 patients with non‐critical respiratory failure. Further evaluation of this combination therapy is needed.

N2  -  Purpose: Using CT findings from a prospective, randomized, open‐label multicenter trial of favipiravir treatment of COVID‐19 patients, the purpose of this study was to compare the utility of machine learning (ML)‐based algorithm with that of CT‐determined disease severity score and time from disease onset to CT (i.e., time until CT) in this setting. Materials and methods: From March to May 2020, 32 COVID‐19 patients underwent initial chest CT before enrollment were evaluated in this study. Eighteen patients were randomized to start favipiravir on day 1 (early treatment group), and 14 patients on day 6 of study participation (late treatment group). In this study, percentages of ground‐glass opacity (GGO), reticulation, consolidation, emphysema, honeycomb, and nodular lesion volumes were calculated as quantitative indexes by means of the software, while CT‐determined disease severity was also visually scored. Next, univariate and stepwise regression analyses were performed to determine relationships between quantitative indexes and time until CT. Moreover, patient outcomes determined as viral clearance in the first 6 days and duration of fever were compared for those who started therapy within 4, 5, or 6 days as time until CT and those who started later by means of the Kaplan–Meier method followed by Wilcoxon’s signed‐rank test. Results: % GGO and % consolidation showed significant correlations with time until CT (p < 0.05), and stepwise regression analyses identified both indexes as significant descriptors for time until CT (p < 0.05). When divided all patients between time until CT of 4 days and that of more than 4 days, accuracy of the combined quantitative method (87.5%) was significantly higher than that of the CT disease severity score (62.5%, p = 0.008). Conclusion: ML‐based CT texture analysis is equally or more useful for predicting time until CT for favipiravir treatment on COVID‐19 patients than CT disease severity score.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Role of favipiravir in preventing disease progression in COVID‐19 remains uncertain. We aimed to determine its effect in preventing disease progression from non‐hypoxia to hypoxia among high risk COVID‐19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: This was an open‐label, randomized clinical trial conducted at 14 public hospitals across Malaysia from February to June 2021 among 500 symptomatic, RT‐PCR confirmed COVID‐19 patients, aged ≥50 years with ≥1 co‐morbidity, and hospitalized within first 7 days of illness. Patients were randomized on 1:1 ratio to favipiravir plus standard care or standard care alone. Favipiravir was administered at 1800mg twice‐daily on day 1 followed by 800mg twice‐daily until day 5. The primary endpoint was rate of clinical progression from non‐hypoxia to hypoxia. Secondary outcomes included rates of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in‐hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 500 patients were randomized (mean age, 62.5 [SD 8.0] years; 258 women [51.6%]; and 251 [50.2%] had COVID‐19 pneumonia), 487 (97.4%) patients completed the trial. Clinical progression to hypoxia occurred in 46 (18.4%) patients on favipiravir plus standard care and 37 (14.8%) on standard care alone (OR 1.30; 95%CI, 0.81‐2.09; P=.28). All three pre‐specified secondary end points were similar between both groups. Mechanical ventilation occurred in 6 (2.4%) vs 5 (2.0%) (OR 1.20; 95%CI, 0.36‐4.23; P=.76), ICU admission in 13 (5.2%) vs 12 (4.8%) (OR 1.09; 95%CI, 0.48‐2.47; P=.84), and in‐hospital mortality in 5 (2.0%) vs 0 (OR 12.54; 95%CI, 0.76‐ 207.84; P=.08). CONCLUSIONS: Among COVID‐19 patients at high risk of disease progression, early treatment with oral favipiravir did not prevent their disease progression from non‐hypoxia to hypoxia.

N2  -  Purpose: To study tolerability and outcome of oral favipiravir treatment among COVID‐19 patients in Nepal. Methods & Materials: In this multi‐centered randomized, open‐labelled phase III clinical trial, we enrolled 18‐80 years old, RT‐PCR confirmed patients with mild to moderate COVID‐19 infection from 9 participating hospitals of Nepal, within 6 days of onset of symptoms. The investigational product (Favipiravir) was compared against placebo in patients with mild infection and against Remdesivir in moderate infection. Patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomly enrolled in the study after taking informed consent. This is a preliminary report of the data analysis. Results: At the time of this preliminary data analysis, 90 cases were enrolled in the study including 70 mild and 20 moderate cases (see table). Among the participants with mild COVID19 infection, clinical improvement was noted in 30 (78.9%) and 27 (84.4%) patients who received Favipiravir and placebo, respectively (p=0.78). While among the participants with moderate infection, 9 (81%) and 8 (88.9%) patients who received Favipiravir and Remdesivir, respectively, had clinical improvement (p=1). Patients tolerated Favipiravir well with only 3 (6.12 %) patients showing adverse events, which were mainly elevated liver function test & uric acid level, both considered minor. None of the patients receiving placebo or remdesivir reported any adverse events. Conclusion: The investigational product has been tolerated well by this group of patients with only mild and reversible side effects in 6.12 % cases. The outcomes between the study groups were comparable.

N2  -  Introduction: Antiviral drugs have shown limited effectiveness in treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). We aimed to assess the effects of a favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine combination on treating moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19 patients. Methods: An investigator‐initiated, multicenter, open‐label, randomized trial at nine hospitals. Eligible patients were adults with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19 defined as oxygen saturation (SaO2) of ≤ 94% while breathing ambient air or significant clinical symptoms with chest x‐ray changes requiring hospital admission. Randomization was in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard care (control group) or standard care plus favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. The primary outcome was time to clinical improvement of two points (from the status at randomization) on a seven‐category ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital within 14 days. Analyses were done in an intention‐to‐treat population. Results: From May 2020 to Jan 2021, 254 patients were enrolled; 129 were assigned to standard of care and 125 to the treatment. The mean age was 52 (± 13) years, and 103 (41%) were women. At randomization, six patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation, 229 (90.15%) were requiring supplemental oxygen only (with or without non‐invasive ventilation), and 19 (7.48%) were receiving neither. The time to clinical improvement was not significantly different between the groups: median of 9 days in the treatment group and 7 days in the control group (HR: 0.845; 95% CI 0.617–1.157; p‐value = 0.29). The 28‐day mortality was not significantly different between the groups (7.63% treatment) vs. (10.32% control); p‐value = 0.45. The most prevalent adverse events were headache, elevation in ALT, and the prolonged QTc interval in the treatment group. Conclusion: The combination of favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine did not result in a statistically significant clinical benefit in patients with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19. Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04392973).

N2  -  Objectives: The selected combination was based on limited evidence clinically and in vitro on the efficacy of the Favipiravir and Hydroxychloroquine in SARS‐CoV‐2. The two medications were listed in many guidelines as treatment options and ongoing trials assessing their efficacy and safety. Thus, we want to prove the clinical effectiveness of the combination as therapy. Trial design: This is an Open label, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID‐19. It is a multicenter trial that will compare Favipiravir plus Hydroxychloroquine combination (experimental arm) to a control arm. Participants: All study procedures will be conducted in eight centres in Saudia Arabia: King Abdulaziz Medical City National Guard Health Affairs in Riyadh. King Abdulaziz Hospital ‐ Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia AlMadina General Hospital, Madnia, Saudi Arabia Al‐Qatif Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia Imam Abdulrahman Al Faisal Hospital, Dammam, Saudi Arabia King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia King Abdulaziz Hospital, Makkah, Saudi Arabia Imam Abdulrahman Alfaisal Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Inclusion Criteria • Should be at least 18 years of age, • Male or nonpregnant female, • Diagnosed with COVID‐19 by PCR confirmed SARS‐coV‐2 viral infection. • Able to sign the consent form and agree to clinical samples collection (or their legal surrogates if subjects are or become unable to make informed decisions). • Moderate or Severe COVID‐19, defined as oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or significant clinical symptoms that require hospital admission. • patients had to be enrolled within 10 days of disease onset. Exclusion Criteria • Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. • Will be transferred to a non‐study site hospital or discharged from hospital within 72 hours. • Known sensitivity/allergy to hydroxychloroquine or Favipiravir • Current use of hydroxychloroquine for another indication • Prior diagnosis of retinopathy • Prior diagnosis of glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency • Major comorbidities increasing the risk of study drug including: i. Hematologic malignancy, ii. Advanced (stage 4‐5) chronic kidney disease or dialysis therapy, iii. Known history of ventricular arrhythmias, iv. Current use of drugs that prolong the QT interval, Severe liver damage (Child‐Pugh score ≥ C, AST> 5 times the upper limit), HIV. • The investigator believes that participating in the trial is not in the best interests of the patient, or the investigator considers unsuitable for enrollment (such as unpredictable risks or subject compliance issues). • Clinical prognostic non‐survival, palliative care, or in deep coma and no have response to supportive treatment within three hours of admission • Patient with irregular rhythm • Patient with a history of heart attack (myocardial infarction) • Patient with a family history of sudden death from heart attack before the age of 50 ��� Take other drugs that can cause prolonged QT interval • Patient who is receiving immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporin) which cannot be switched to another agent or adjusted while using the investigational drug • Gout/history of Gout or hyperuricemia (above the ULN), hereditary xanthinuria or xanthine calculi of the urinary tract. Intervention and comparator: The treatment intervention would be for a maximum of 10 days from randomization and it would be as follows: Favipiravir for 10 days: Administer 1800 mg (9 tablets) by mouth twice daily for one day, followed by 800mg (4 tablets) twice daily (total days of therapy is 10 days) Hydroxychloroquine for 5 days: (400mg) twice daily on day 1; for days 2‐5 (200mg) twice daily. Reference Comparator Therapy: Standard of care is defined as: Treatment that is accepted by medical experts as a proper treatment for Covid‐19 disease. Standard care comprised of, as necessary, supplemental oxygen, noninvasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, vasopressor support, renal‐replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and antiviral therapy except Favipiravir. Also, it may include intravenous fluids and medications for symptoms relief. Main outcomes: The primary endpoint is the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to an improvement of two points (from the status at randomization) on a seven‐category ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital, whichever came first (14 days from Randomization). Randomisation: Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the combination group (Favipiravir and Hydroxychloroquine) or a control group. The patients will be randomized utilizing Web based data entry System with a stratification based on the centre and the ICU admission. Blinding (masking): This is an Open label study and only the analyst will be blinded during the study conduct. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): Under the classical two arm parallel design the total effective sample sizes needed is 472 subjects (236 subjects per group). Trial status: Protocol version 3.1 (dated 11 Aug 2020), and currently recruitment is ongoing. The date recruitment started was May 21, 2020 and the investigators anticipate the trial will finish recruiting by the end of December 2020. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04392973, 19 May 2020 Full protocol: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.

N2  -  A prospective, randomised, open label study of the combined use of azithromcycin, hydroxychloroquine, zinc and standard clinical care verses favipiravir and standard clinical care verses standard clinical care alone. A computer‐based software will randomise participants 1:1:1 to either receive; hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc and standard medical care; favipiravir and standard medical care or standard medical care alone. The allocated medical regime will commence for 10 days. Research blood, sputum nose swab and urine samples will be collected at baseline, as well as between day 5 and 10, and between day 14 and 28 to enable comparative analyses. A COVID‐19 antibody test will also be performed 14‐28 days after randomisation. In the event of clinically indicated bronchoscopy taking place within 28 days of consent then additional bronchoscopy washing and brushing samples and paired blood sample will be taken for research purposes If a participant is discharged before one of the latter time points, they will be required to return to hospital (provided they are well enough) for the collection of repeat samples. Participants will be closely monitored whilst taking the study medications. Participants will study exit at subject death or 28 days post‐randomisation.

N2  -  Objectives: A variety of possible mechanisms can make the nucleic acid test of patients who meet the discharge conditions positive again, including reinfection, reactivation of the original virus, lack of strict discharge criteria, new infection, and so on. Different reasons will correspond to different prevention and control measures. We will enroll patients who are discharged after treatment, whose nucleic acid test has changed from negative to positive during the screening visit, regardless of the severity of the symptoms, to investigate the mechanism, clinical outcome and therapeutic efficacy with Favipiravir patients with Corona virus Disease 2019. Favipiravir is an anti‐viral agent that selectively and potently inhibits the RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase, it has been used for treatment of some life‐threatening infections such as Ebola virus, Lassa virus and rabies. Its therapeutic efficacy has been proven in these diseases. Trial design: This is a multi‐center, two arm, open label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. Participants: Eligibility criteria: Inclusion criteria: 1. Adults 18 to 80 years, male or female. 2. After the first diagnosis and treatment of COVID‐19, the nucleic acid test of respiratory specimens such as sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs, has been negative for two consecutive times (sampling time interval of at least 24 hours), in accordance with the COVID‐19's diagnosis and treatment Plan (7th Edition), discharged. 3. During screening visit (follow‐up after discharge), The nucleic acid test of COVID‐19 is positive in any one of the following samples: Sputum, throat swabs, blood, feces or other specimens. Regardless of whether or not they had symptoms and the severity of symptoms. 4. Volunteer to participate in the research and sign the Informed Consent Form. Exclusion Criteria: 1. Allergic to Favipiravjr; 2. Pregnant or lactating women 3. Uncontrolled diseases of the blood and cardiovascular system, liver or kidney. 4. History of mental disorders, drug abuse or dependence; 5. Researchers consider it inappropriate for adults to participate; 6. Participating in other clinical studies. Loss to Follow up: Cases that do not complete the clinical trial program will be regarded as lost to follow up. Including the withdrawal of patients by themselves (such as poor compliance, etc.), or the withdrawal of patients ordered by the researcher (those who need other drugs which affect the judgment of the curative effect, and those who need to stop taking drugs for severe adverse events) Study setting: The participating hospitals are some of the designated hospitals that have been or may be admitting patients who meet the eligibility criteria, mainly in Hubei, Shenzhen, Anhui and Beijing. Participants will be recruited from these 15 hospitals: Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Hubei; Jinyintan Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei; Ezhou Central Hospital, Hubei; The Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, Anhui; The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Anhui; Beijing Youan Hospital, Beijing; Capital Medical University Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing; Ezhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hubei; Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Hubei; The Fifth Hospital of ShiJiazhuang, Hebei; Jinan Infectious Diseases Hospital, Shandong; Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan; Wuxi No.5 People's Hospital, Jiangsu; The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, Guangdong; The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengfu Medical College, AnHui. Intervention and comparator: Favipiravir group (experimental): Favipiravir 1600mg each dose, twice a day on the 1st day; 600mg each dose, twice a day from the 2nd to the 7th day, Oral administration, the maximum number of days taken will be no more than 14 days plus routine treatment for COVID‐19. Regular treatment group (control): Treatments other than Antiviral drugs can be given. Routine treatment for patients with the corona virus will be administered, this includes oxygen therapy, drugs that reduced phlegm and relieve cough, including thymosin, proprietary Chinese medicine, etc. Main outcomes: Primary Outcome Measures: Viral nucleic acid test negative [Time Frame: 5 months]: Subjects who tested negative for nucleic acid from sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs for two consecutive times (sampling time interval of at least 24 hours). Secondary Outcome Measures: Clinical cure [Time Frame: 5 months]: 1. Body temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days; 2. Lung image improved. 3. Clinical manifestation improved; 4. The viral nucleic acid test of respiratory specimens was negative for two consecutive times (sampling time interval of at least 24 hours). Randomization: The central randomization system (Interactive Web Response Management System), will be used to randomly divide the subjects into the experimental group and the control group according to the ratio of 2:1. In this study, block randomization will be used, in blocks of 6. Blinding (masking): This is an open label trial. Trial participants, investigators, care givers, outcome assessors, and date analysts are not blinded to group assignment. Numbers to be randomised: 210 patients are expected to be enrolled and allocated according to the ratio of 2 (Favipiravir group, n=140): 1(regular treatment group, n=70). Trial Status: Protocol version number 3.0, 10th April 2020 First Patient, first visit 17th March 2020; recruitment end date anticipated June 1, 2020. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04333589, April 3, 2020. Registered April 3, 2020.

N2  -  A key strategy in the treatment of COVID‐19 would be to find an effective antiviral agent that would decrease the peak viral load and, consequently, the associated degree of immunopathological damage that follows this phase. The clinically approved substances considered for this study are used for treatment of other virus diseases, like influenza (favipiravir), HIV (atazanavir) and HCV (sofosbuvir and daclatasvir). Severe progression of COVID‐19 among patients under treatment for these aforementioned viruses is empirical less common. Besides, the clinical rationale, there are pre‐clinical evidence pointing out that patients with COVID‐19 could benefit from treatments with favipiravir, atazanavir, sofosbuvir and daclatasvir.

N2  -  Early in the COVID‐19 pandemic, it became apparent that the elderly are disproportionately bearing the burden of disease and mortality. Many outbreaks are occurring in long‐term care homes (LTCHs), with strikingly high mortality rates: nearly two‐thirds of all Canadian COVID‐ 19 deaths are in LTCH residents. This is unsurprising, as viral respiratory outbreaks in LTCHs are devastating: before the use of influenza vaccine, case fatality rates during influenza outbreaks were as high as 55%. Interventions are thus urgently needed to control LTCH outbreaks to mitigate harms to this vulnerable population and maximize acute care capacity. Chemoprophylaxis is the cornerstone of management of LTCH influenza outbreaks and disease prophylaxis has been deemed a critical COVID‐19 research priority by the World Health Organization. While definitive therapies do not yet exist, there is significant interest in repurposing existing anti‐viral agents against COVID‐19. Favipiravir, a broad spectrum antiviral agent, demonstrates activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro, and was associated with faster viral clearance, radiographic improvement, and clinical recovery in early trials. Favipiravir is an ideal candidates for chemoprophylaxis, as it is orally available and has a reasonable safety profile. To address the need to intervene to prevent the spread of COVID‐19 in LTCHs, we propose a cluster‐randomized placebo‐controlled trial of chemoprophylaxis in LTCHs experiencing COVID‐19 outbreaks. This study is a partially blinded, placebo‐controlled cluster randomized trial of chemoprophylaxis to control outbreaks of COVID‐19 in LCTHs for the elderly. The unit of analysis is a ward/unit. An outbreak is defined as ≥ 2 symptomatic microbiologically‐confirmedCOVID‐19 cases within 7 days on the LTCH unit. This design is selected to mimic the current approach to outbreaks of other respiratory viral infections, both because this approach has proven effective for these other viruses, and because it is standard practice and therefore feasible to implement. Eligible LTCHs will be asked to report outbreaks to the study in addition to the legally‐required reporting to their local public health unit; public health units will also be asked to discuss the study with LTCHs reporting outbreaks. In addition, study staff will contact the infection control practitioner in each of the screened LTCHs twice weekly, to ensure the prompt identification of outbreak units. Residents and staff will be assessed for contraindications to enrollment and informed consent will be obtained for residents and staff to receive the allocated intervention, and to be followed up individually for clinical outcomes, adherence and safety during the outbreak. Surveillance for infection will occur as usual for resident illness within each LTCH; staff will be asked to report symptoms and will be screened for symptoms each time they enter the building. Consenting residents and staff will be screened at day 0, day 14 and day 40 to identify asymptomatic infections and to assess duration of viral shedding. The primary outcome will be control of the outbreak, defined as no new microbiologically confirmed case of COVID‐19 for 24 consecutive days up to day 40. LTCH units experiencing an outbreak of COVID‐19 will be randomized to either favipiravir or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Favipiravir or placebo will be offered to all residents and staff who will be working on the unit during the chemoprophylaxis period, according to the allocation. Study drug will continue for a duration of 25 days. The dosage for favipiravir to be used in this study for chemoprophylaxis is 1600 mg (8 x 200 mg tablets) orally twice daily on day 1 followed by 800 mg (4 x 200 mg tablets) orally twice daily on day 2‐25. Residents in the LTCH unit diagnosed with COVID‐19 at enrollment will be offered treatment with favipiravir or placebo for 14 days, according to the LTCH unit allocation. The dose of favipiravir for treatment is 2000mmg orally twice daily on day 1, then 1000 mg orally twice daily for 13 additional days.

N2  -  A randomized controlled open‐label study approved by the local ethical committee. The study included patients with COVID‐19 admitted to the T.M. Tareev Clinic of Internal Diseases of I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University in whom the disease was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome‐related coronavirus 2 (SARS‐COV‐2). The study was conducted from December 2020 to March 2021 and included participants in the age range from 18 to 75 years. The exclusion criteria were age over 75 years or under 18 years, consumption of probiotics for 3 months prior to admission, history of intolerance to probiotics or their components, refusal to participate and sign informed consent, pregnancy or breastfeeding, cancer or mental illness, and severe renal (glomerular filtration rate less than 50 mL/min) or hepatic (equivalent to cirrhosis class B or C on the Child‐Pugh scale) dysfunction at the time of admission. Patients who prematurely discontinued the consumption of probiotics for reasons not related to the development of side effects were excluded from the study. The patients were randomised to the probiotics group (PRO group) or the control group (CON group). Patients in the PRO group received probiotics containing 109 colony forming units (CFU) of Lactobacillus rhamnosus PDV 1705, 109 CFU of Bifidobacterium bifidum PDV 0903, 109 CFU of B. longum subsp. infantis PDV 1911, and 109 CFU of B. longum PDV 2301 three times a day during the hospital stay but for no more than 14 days (PDV is the commercial letter designation of the bacterial strains). The end point of the trial was day 14 of hospitalisation or the day of the patient's discharge or death, whichever occurred earlier. The control group consisted of patients who did not receive probiotics. Patients in both the groups also received dexamethasone and antiviral (favipiravir and/or riamilovir), antibacterial, anticoagulant (enoxaparin in most cases; rivaroxaban and dabigatran were used much less frequently), and anticytokine (tocilizumab or/and olokizumab) drugs according to indications and contraindications. Death from any cause was considered the primary outcome. Duration of hospitalisation, total duration of the disease, incidence of admission to intensive care unit, need for oxygen support or mechanical ventilation, and changes in the values of key biomarkers were considered the main secondary outcomes. The duration of diarrhoea [loose or watery stools or an increase in the frequency of bowel movements (more than three times per day)] and incidence of hospital‐acquired diarrhoea as well as the progression of pre‐existing liver injury and onset of liver injury were considered additional secondary outcomes. Liver injury was determined through the presence of abnormalities in any of the main liver test findings (serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma‐glutamyl transferase, total bilirubin, and albumin levels). The volume of the affected lungs was measured using chest computed tomography (CT); it included the sum of ground glass and consolidation volumes. Results are presented as the median [interquartile range]. The groups were compared using Mann‐Whitney test for continuous data and chi‐square test for categorical data. Wilcoxon test was used to assess the changes in continuous biomarker values. Mortality was assessed using the Kaplan‐Meier estimator and Cox's test. A p value ≤0.05 was considered the criterion for significance. Statistical calculations were performed using "Statistica 10" soft (TIBCO Software inc, Palo Alto, CA)

N2  -  The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the Favipiravir (Areplivir) drug, compared to the standard etiotropic therapy in the patients hospitalized with COVID‐19. Material and methods. The research was conducted as a part of an open, randomized, multicenter comparative study of the efficacy and safety of Areplivir, 200 mg film‐coated tablets ("PROMOMED RUS" LLC, Russia), in the patients hospitalized with COVID‐19. The dosing regimen of Favipiravir was 1600 mg twice a day on the 1st day and 600 mg twice a day on days 2 14. Thirty nine patients were enrolled into the study with a laboratory‐established diagnosis of a new type of Coronavirus infection caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 (confirmed) of moderate severity, with pneumonia. The group of comparison (22 patients) received standard etiotropic therapy, prescribed in accordance with the current version of the temporary guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID‐19, represented mainly by Hydroxychloroquine with the dosage regimen of 800 mg on the 1st day, then 400 mg on days 2‐7, and Azithromycin 500 mg once a day for 5 days. The main group (17 patients) received Favipiravir (Areplivir) as etiotropic therapy. Results. In the main group, the time period until fever disappeared was found to be 1.36 days shorter than in the group of comparison (p0.05); there was a higher rate of the reduction of inflammatory changes in the lungs according to the computer tomography data (38.4% vs 14.9%, p0.05). By the end of the treatment, there was also a lower lactate level in the blood (27.1%, p0.05) than in the patients of the group of comparison. The evaluation of the drug efficacy according to the Categorical Ordinal Scale of Clinical Improvement and measurements of oxygen saturation in the blood, manifested similar positive dynamics in the patients treated according to various etiotropic therapy regimens. By the end of the treatment, the RNA SARS‐CoV‐2 tests were also negative in all the patients. As for the overall frequency of adverse events (AEs), no relevant distinctions were found between the groups. A greater part of AEs was related to hepatotoxicity, with a predominantly clinically relevant increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). A clinically relevant prolongation of the corrected QT interval on the standard ECG was found to occur in the standard‐Therapy group on day 5, while no serious AEs were registered in the main group. No serious adverse reactions were registered in patients of the main group. Conclusion. The efficacy of the Favipiravir (Areplivir) therapy for the novel coronavirus infection has proved to be superior to the efficacy of the standard etiotropic therapy in a number of aspects. Basing on the obtained findings, Favipiravir (Areplivir) drug can be recommended for treating patients with the novel coronavirus infection of moderate severity.

N2  -  The platform trial will assess drugs with potential SARS‐CoV‐2 antiviral activity of three general types: A. Repurposed potential antiviral drugs (initially from: hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, lopinavir‐ritonavir, miglustat, remdesivir, nitazoxanide, nebulised unfractionated heparin (UFH), favipiravir) Repurposed drugs are already recommended in some countries. Showing that they do not have a significant antiviral activity is as important as showing that they do. B. Positive control: monoclonal antibody initially Monoclonal antibodies are vulnerable to viral escape mutations. Tracking their performance over time is important to characterise the impact and inform the therapeutics of mutant SARS‐CoV‐2 strains. Monoclonal antibodies are expensive and cannot be produced at large scale currently, but this may change in the near future. C. Novel small molecule drugs that have gone through phase 1 testing Each site will include a negative control arm consisting of patients not receiving any study drug except for antipyretics‐ paracetamol. At any given time in the study, it is possible that not all intervention arms are available. Randomisation ratios will be uniform across all available treatment arms of type A and B and the control arm in each site. Once interventions of type C (novel drugs) are added to the platform, response adaptive randomisation will apply ("pick the winner").

KW  -  Hydroxychloroquine
N2  -  Currently there are no proven treatments for COVID‐19 and current standard therapy is supportive care with oxygen supplementation and treatment of symptoms. Several re‐purposed and new drugs have been investigated but none is conclusive for efficacy against COVID‐19.These include the antimalarial drugs‐ chloroquine(CQ) and hydroxychloroquine(HCQ), antivirals such as remdesivir and favipiravir and antiretroviral combination therapies such as lopinavir/ritonavir. Although hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are readily accessible in Uganda and could be explore for treatment of COVID‐19,current data regarding their efficacy and safety is scanty. It is necessary to determine whether HCQ can be useful for treatment of Ugandan patients with COVID‐19 for the following reasons : Firstly, the Ugandan population expresses a high level of variability with a younger population with more than 50% under the age of 15 years. Secondly, the population with co‐morbid conditions like diabetes mellitus ,hypertension and cardiovascular disease is significantly lower compared to higher income countries. Preliminary data from the first 52 COVID‐19 patients in Uganda treated with HCQ demonstrated faster symptom resolution although this did not reach statistical significance. Lastly, HCQ has not been tested in mild‐moderate disease where hospitalization is not necessary and we therefore do not know whether it can lead to faster viral clearance, slow disease progression and reduce time to symptom clearance. Our main aim will be to determine if hydroxychloroquine can lead to faster viral clearance.

N2  -  The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS‐CoV2) has been identified in Wuhan, China, which causes severe pulmonary complications and flu syndrome, which has spread rapidly to all continents. Approximately 25% of hospitalized patients require treatment in intensive care units and 10% require mechanical ventilation. The diagnosis is made by the molecular polymerase chain reaction test. However, diagnostic tests are limited. The clinical care of the patient with COVID‐19 is similar to that of patients with severe infectious respiratory complications, consisting of support and oxygen supplementation. Several medications have been tested as remdesivir, a pro‐drug nucleoside, which acts by inhibiting viral RNA transcription, although a recently published study has shown no benefit. China recently approved the use of favipiravir, an antiviral used for influenza, as an experimental therapy for COVID‐19. Hydroxychloroquine is a drug with great potential treatment, as it can inhibit the pH‐dependent steps of replication of various viruses, with a potent effect on SARS‐CoV infection and spread. In this way, the present study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the hydroxychloroquine in patients with symptomatic SARS‐Cov2.

N2  -  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a problem that is being faced in more than 200 countries in the world, including Indonesia. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID‐19 outbreak as a pandemic. The transmission of the virus occurred rapidly that 2 weeks from the first case diagnosed, 1000 patients tested positive. A week later, the number of positive cases exceeded 4600, reaching more than 30,000 patients and 2,500 deaths on March 18, 2020. The death rate due to COVID‐19 in Indonesia is one of the highest in Asia. To date, no therapy has been shown to be effective for Coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2). A vaccine for SARS‐CoV‐2 also has not been found at this time and is in the research phase. Current management of COVID‐19 patients focuses primarily on providing supportive care. Currently, several countries make treatment guidelines for COVID‐19 patients by providing several types of anti‐viral drugs and other drugs such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, immunoglobulins, anti‐cytokine agents or immunomodulators. The administration of these drugs does not escape the various side effects experienced by patients. Administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine carries the risk of causing prolonged QT interval which can lead to arrhytmia disturbances such as torsades des pointes in certain people. Administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin increases the risk of developing arrhythmias. Giving anti‐viruses such as lopinavir / ritonavir, umifenovir, remdesivir, favipiravir can also cause various side effects including gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), impaired liver function, and hyperuricaemia. Treatment with human immunoglobulins has been associated with a significantly increased risk of thrombotic events. Currently, no acupuncture research on COVID‐19 patients has been published. However, acupuncture can play a role in several conditions that occur in COVID‐19 according to the pathophysiology that occurs, this has been proven through several clinical studies conducted on non‐COVID‐19 cases that have pathophysiology that resemble COVID‐19 conditions. In COVID‐19 with mild‐moderate symptoms, acupuncture can play a role in boosting the immune system, including increasing the number of Natural Killer cells and lymphocytes. Whereas in cases of severe COVID‐19 symptoms, it is hoped that acupuncture can provide anti‐inflammatory effect and prevent cytokine storm.

N2  -  Introduction: Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have an inherently compromised humoral and cellular immunity predisposing to Covid‐19 infection. Factors associated with increased risk of adverse COVID‐19 outcome is unclear. The aim of our retrospective analysis was to evaluate COVID‐19 infection outcome among our myeloma patients and to define the possible prognostic parameters. Patients And Methods: Between March 2020‐ February 2022, 10 myeloma patients were diagnosed with COVID infection confirmed by PCR test and computer tomography (CT). The severity of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was classified according to WHO definition as: mild: symptomatic without pneumonia or hypoxia; moderate: with or without signs of pneumonia with SpO2 >90% on room air; severe disease: with symptoms of pneumonia and respiratory rate> 30/min, severe respiratory distress or SpO2 <90% on room air. Critical disease: with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock. In addition, CALL (comorbidity‐age‐lymphocyte count‐lactate dehydrogenase) score was used. All patients were given supportive care including heparin and 0.4 gr/kg/day intravenous immunoglobulin for those presenting with immunoparesis regardless of IgG treshold of 4.0 gr/L. Convalescent or monoclonal plasma was not used. All anti‐myeloma treatments were discontinued until full recovery. Results: Baseline characteristics of our patients are summarized in Table 1. The median age at onset of COVID‐19 was 62 years. Three patients were therapy naive, two newly diagnosed MM and one with smoldering MM. At the time point of COVID‐19 diagnosis, eight patients were being followed without treatment. Twenty patients were followed out‐patient without any treatment and with full recovery. Eighteen (16%) patients were admitted to ICU and 13 (12%) required invasive mechanic ventilation. Two patients received hydroxychloroquine, 68 received favipiravir, one patient received anakinra and two patients received tocilizumab. Full recovery from COVID‐19 infection with regression of clinic symptoms and achievement of PCR negativity of COVID‐19 was observed in 93 (84.5%) patients and 17 (15.5%) patients died due to severe COVID‐19 pneumonia with respiratory and multi‐organ failure. No death due to thromboembolic event was observed. As expected, high CALL risk score (HR:0.17 (95% CI: 0.06‐0.48) and higher COVID severity grade (HR:0.26 (95% CI: 0.07‐ 0.97) were detrimental. Age did not have an impact. However response <VGPR (HR: 3.1 (95% CI: 1.0‐9.6); p=0.04) or immunoparesis (HR: 6.59 (95% CI: 1.44‐30.1); p=0.01) were correlated (Kappa CE: 0.212, p=0.03) and associated with worse COVID‐19 outcome (Figure 1‐2‐3). In MVA with age, response, Call score, vaccine, immunoparesis entered in the model only immunoparesis was significant (HR: 6.5, p=0.016). Mortality prior to introduction of vaccines reduced to 3.6 % compared with 11.8 % at the pre‐vaccine period. There was a trend to increase in Covid infection incidence recently due to the Omicron variant. Conclusion: Among 110 MM patients, the mortality rate is less than the one reported by IMS during the beginning of the pandemic. In our experience COVID‐19 infection severity and mortality decreases with anti‐Covid vaccination, response ≥VGPR or lack of immunoparesis. Importantly, MM patients with COVID‐19 infection need close monitoring for severe COVID‐19‐related complications, and correction of humoral immunity may be life‐saving. .

N2  -  1. Introduction and rationale: An outbreak of atypical pneumonia of unknown cause erupted in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The symptoms ranged from mild symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, with multi‐organ affection leading to patients' death. Within few weeks, genetic sequence of the causative virus was identified to be close to Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Virus (SARS‐CoV) (Zhou et al, 2020). The newly identified virus was named Novel Coronavirus or SARS‐CoV2, and the clinical disease as COVID‐19 (Chung et al, 2021). The disease spread rapidly with travel movements around the world and the World Health organization announced the COVID‐19 as a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020). The worldwide disease toll approached more the 165 million confirmed cases including more than 3.5 million deaths as of May 21st, 2021, making it the worst pandemic in the last 100 years [WHO Coronavirus (COVID‐19) Dashboard]. Attempting to find therapeutic options for COVID‐19, viral inhibitor drugs that have been used against influenza and HIV, were repurposed to be tested against SARS‐CoV2. These include Chloroquine/ Hydroxychloroquine which inhibit viral entry and endocytosis in vitro, protease inhibitors Lopinavir‐Ritonavir which disrupt viral replication in‐vitro, and RNA dependent polymerase inhibitors including Ribavirin, Favipiravir and Remdesivir (Wiersinga et al, 2020). Only Remdesivir showed initial promising results in a randomized clinical trial (Beigel et al, 2020), however, currently the World Health Organization recommends against its use in any disease severity (Lamontage et al, 2021). Ivermectin is an inexpensive and available antiparasitic drug, with favourable safety profile. It showed inhibitory effect on SARS‐CoV2 viral replication in vitro and in animal models (Formiga et al, 2021). Several research groups investigated Ivermectin in COVID‐19, particularly early in mild disease where viral replication is more active (Kory et al, 2021). In its living guideline on drugs used to treat COVID‐19, the WHO recommended against the use of Ivermectin in COVID‐19, regardless of duration of symptoms or disease severity, except in the contest of clinical trials. The reason was high degree of uncertainty about clinical outcomes of importance to the patients like time to clinical improvement, hospital admission, duration of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and mortality. The WHO recommends larger and well‐designed studies to solve this uncertainty (Lamontage et al, 2021). In the present study protocol, the investigators plan to study the effect of Ivermectin versus standard treatment in patients with confirmed mild symptomatic COVID‐19. The primary outcome will be rate of intensive care admission. Secondary outcomes will be time to clinical improvement, patient's clinical state using 7‐point ordinal scale at different time points, proportion of subjects needing hospitalization, supplemental oxygen >24 hours, duration of hospitalization, duration of ICU stay or death within 21 days.

N2  -  Corona virus disease 19 (COVID‐19) is a rapidly spreading disease that involves almost every part of the world. Although numerous attempts are being carried out to prevent and treat the disease, there is no consensus about the gold standard treatment. In the recent study (El‐Badrawy et al., 2021) our group published a controlled study investigating the role of inhalable sodium bicarbonate (SB) as adjuvant treatment of non‐severe CT‐ identified COVID‐19 pneumonia. The study concluded that sodium bicarbonate 8.4% inhalation with its nasal instillation could be a possible adjuvant therapy for patients with non‐severe COVID‐19 pneumonia. Nevertheless, our previous study suffers from some limitations being non randomized, with a small sample size and short duration of follow up. Moreover, the study included only moderate cases of COVID‐19 and excluded mild and severe cases. The present protocol is designed to avoid the limitations of our previous study in an attempt to obtain clear answer about the role of inhalable SB as an adjuvant treatment of COVID‐19. The emergence of new mutants of Corona virus is a new problem that can face the synthesized new anti COVID vaccines. The use of SB in treatment of COVID‐19 may overcome Corona virus whatever its mutant variant. We hypothize that SB may neutralize the effect of sialic acid through change of pH and change of the negative change, therefore prevent attachment, fusion and transport of the virus into the host cell. Theory: SB inhalation may affect COVID‐19 in respiratory tract through the following mechanism (Singh et al., 2020): 1. Alkalinisation of cell lysosomes; a mechanism similar to that of CQ and HCQ as reported by Singh et al 2020 that inhibit viral entry, transport and post‐entry events. 2. Reaction with sialic acid on respiratory epithelial cells by buffering of the negative charge or change the pH of sialic acid that prevent entry of viruses into respiratory epithelial cells and/ or reinfection of the released viruses from the infected cells. Aim of the study: The aim of the study is to investigate the role of SB 8.4% as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of COVID‐ 19 patients proved to be RT‐PCR positive (mild, moderate and severe). Patients and Methods Duration of the study: In the period between September 2021 and March 2022 Place of the study: Isolation department (for hospitalized cases) and COVID‐19 surveillance clinic (for mild cases treated at home), Mansoura University hospitals. Patients Inclusion Criteria: In the period between September 2021 and March 2022, all consecutive patients suspected as COVID‐19 presented to the respiratory evaluation zone and outpatient clinic of our university will be subjected to RT‐PCR test for COVID. Patients proved to be RT‐PCR positive will be included in the present study. The study will include all grades of the diseases. Exclusion Criteria: Children less than 18 years, pregnant ladies, those who will refuse enrollment or discontinue follow up. Study Design: This is a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) including two arms: control group receiving standard treatment as per the routine protocol of the Egyptian Ministry of Health (Masoud et al., 2020) according to the degree of the disease, and a study group receiving the standard treatment in addition to the adjuvant inhalable SB. Method of randomization: Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the standard treatment in addition to the adjuvant inhalable SB or standard treatment alone. The study is open‐label. Methods Baseline assessment: Both groups were subjected to the following; full history, clinical examination, complete blood count, C‐ reactive protein, D dimer, liver function and kidney function tests. Radiological assessment with chest CT scan. Clinical, laboratory and radiological investigations were done at the time of diagnosis before start of treatment, after one week, one month, two months, and three months. Clinical assessment of the disease was defined according to World Health Organization (WHO, 2021 (table 1) Table 1: WHO Severity definitions (World Health Organization, 2021) Critical COVID‐19 Defined by the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, septic shock, or other conditions that would normally require the provision of life‐sustaining therapies such as mechanical ventilation (invasive or non‐invasive) or vasopressor therapy Severe COVID‐19: Defined by any of: Oxygen saturation < 90% on room air. Respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min in adults. Signs of severe respiratory distress (accessory muscle use, inability to complete full sentences, central cyanosis, or presence of any other general danger signs. Moderate disease Adolescent with clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnea, fast breathing) but no signs of severe pneumonia, including SpO2 ≥ 90% on room air Mild disease Symptomatic patients (fever, cough, fatigue, anorexia, myalgias, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anosmia or ageusia) PCR +ve for COVID‐19 without evidence of viral pneumonia or hypoxia. Baseline investigations: The following laboratory studies will be done for all patients (Samprathi & Jayashree, 2021): ‐ a complete blood count (CBC), ‐ CRP. ‐ serum creatinine, and liver function tests ‐ D‐dimer. Radiological assessment by CT: • CT images for each patient will be assessed for the following abnormalities: ground‐glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, nodules, number of lung lobes affection, interlobular septal thickening and pleural effusion. In cases of GGO and consolidation, the severity of the lung affection is evaluated according to Bernheim et al. (2020), with each of the five lung lobes assessed and scored for the degree of involvement and classified as: score 0, no involvement (0% affected); 1, minimal (1‐25%); 2, mild (26‐50%); 3, moderate (51‐75%); and 4, severe (76‐100%). A total severity score is obtained by summing the five lobe scores, with a range between 0 and 20. A score of 1‐5 is graded as 'minimal', 6‐10 as 'mild', 11‐15 as 'moderate' and 16‐20 as 'severe. Standard Treatment: * For mild cases: If the patient is old age > 60 years, has uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension, active malignancy, obesity with BMI > 40 or more than 3 symptoms, the recommended treatment is ivermectin 6 mg daily or Favipiravir 1600 mg twice daily the first day then 600 mg twice daily for 5 days ‐ For moderate cases… Anti‐virals Immune‐modulators Anti‐coagulation Favipiravir 1600 mg twice daily the first day then 600 mg twice daily for 5 days Steroid (dexamethasone 6 mg or its oral equivalent) if patient has severe dyspnea or CT scan showing rapid deterioration or saturation < 93% Prophylactic anticoagulant if D‐dimer between 500‐1000 and therapeutic anti‐coagulation if D‐dimer > 1000 Remdesivir for high risk population with saturation < 92% (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for 5 days ‐ For severe and critical cases…. Anti‐virals Immune‐modulators Anti‐coagulation Remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for 5 days Steroid (dexamethasone 6 mg or methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/24 hours) Tocilizumab 4‐8 mg/Kg/day for 2 doses 12 to 24 hours apart after failure of steroid therapy to improve the case for 24 hours Prophylactic anticoagulant if D‐dimer between 500‐1000 and therapeutic anti‐coagulation if D‐dimer > 1000 or if severe hypoxemia Adjuvant SB treatment: Inhalation of SB 8.4% via a jet nebulizer (5 ml every 4 h) starting at 7:00 to 23:00 hours every day for 30 days together with instillation of SB 8.4% drops 4‐times daily (three drops for each nostril) were offered to all patients in the study group (El‐Badrawy et al., 2019). Place of Treatment: Mild cases: home isolation Moderate cases without risk factors will be treated at home as per the protocol of the Egyptian Ministry of Health (Masoud et al., 2020), while moderate cases with risk factors (old age > 60 years, uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension, active malignancy, obesity with BMI > 40 or saturation < 92%), severe and critical cases will be treated at Isolation department, Mansoura University hospitals. Severe cases will be treated at Isolation department, Mansoura University hospitals. Outcome measures will include the following: I. Clinical outcomes: ‐ The time to recovery defined as the first day, during the 28 days after enrollment, on which a patient met the criteria for category 1, 2, or 3 on the eight‐category ordinal scale by Beigel et al., (2020): ‐ Scale 1, not hospitalized and no limitations of activities; ‐ Scale 2, not hospitalized, with limitation of activities, home oxygen requirement, or both; ‐ Scale 3, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care (used if hospitalization was extended for infection‐control or other nonmedical reasons); ‐ Scale 4, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen but requiring ongoing medical care (related to Covid‐19 or to other medical conditions); ‐ Scale 5, hospitalized, requiring any supplemental oxygen; ‐ Scale 6, hospitalized, requiring noninvasive ventilation or use of high‐flow oxygen devices; ‐ Scale 7, hospitalized, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); and ‐ Scale 8, death. ‐ Clinical status at days 7, 14 and 30. ‐ Number of days with supplemental oxygen. ‐ Number of days with noninvasive ventilation or high‐flow oxygen. ‐ Number of days with invasive ventilation. ‐ The incidence of new oxygen use, of noninvasive ventilation or high‐flow oxygen, and of invasive ventilation. ‐ Number of days of hospitalization. ‐ Mortality. II. Laboratory and Radiological Outcome Measures: • For all patients, a complete blood count (CBC), CRP and D‐dimer at baseline, day 7, day 30. • Radiological assessment using CT chest at baseline, one week and one month later. Risk of COVID‐19 infection transmission to health care workers from nebulizers as a method for aerosol generation: The British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises that patients with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 may continue to use their nebulizer because the aerosols produced by them are generated from fluid within the nebulizer chamber that does not carry patient‐derived viral particles. Indeed, if a particle in the aerosol comes into contact with contaminated mucous membrane, it ceases to be airborne and therefore will not be aerosolized. In any case, healthcare workers should use appropriate hand hygiene (wash hands and put on fresh gloves) when helping patients remove nebulizers and oxygen masks (British Thoracic Society, 2020). Practical advices (Cazzola et al., 2021): 1. Pre‐nebulization • Washing hands • Ensure the device is clean • Ensure adequate protection for health care workers and bystander hosts 2. During nebulization • Separate room or negative pressure room (hospital/clinic); when possible, outside the house on a porch or patio or in a garage and in any case, near open windows or in areas of increased air circulation (home) • Mouth piece preferred over facemask 3. Post‐nebulization ‐ Cleaning and disinfection of nebulizer ‐ Cleaning of the surface and areas of nebulization
