AB  - The new type of coronavirus (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2 originated from Wuhan, China and has led to a worldwide pandemic. COVID-19 is a novel emerging infectious  disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 characterized as atypical pneumonia. As of July 1,  2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2.  The typical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, sore throat, fatigue,  cough, and dyspnoea combined with recent exposure. Most of the patients with  COVID-19 have mild or moderate disease, however up to 5-10% present with severe  and even life-threatening disease course. The mortality rates are approximately  2%. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective and specific antiviral  treatment. Currently, supportive care measures such as ventilation oxygenation  and fluid management remain the standard of care. Several clinical trials are  currently trying to identify the most potent drug or combination against the  disease, and it is strongly recommended to enroll patients into ongoing trials.  Antivirals can be proven as safe and effective only in the context of randomized  clinical trials. Currently several agents such as chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, monoclonal antibodies, antisense RNA,  corticosteroids, convalescent plasma and vaccines are being evaluated. The large  numbers of therapeutic interventions aim to define the most efficacious regimen.  The aim of this article is to describe the treatment strategies that have been  used for COVID-19 patients and review all the available literature.

AB  - The precocity and efficacy of the vaccines developed so far against COVID-19 has been the most significant and saving advance against the pandemic. The  development of vaccines has not prevented, during the whole period of the  pandemic, the constant search for therapeutic medicines, both among existing  drugs with different indications and in the development of new drugs. The  Scientific Committee of the COVID-19 of the Illustrious College of Physicians of  Madrid wanted to offer an early, simplified and critical approach to these new  drugs, to new developments in immunotherapy and to what has been learned from the  immune response modulators already known and which have proven effective against  the virus, in order to help understand the current situation.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Currently there is not an effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19, but a large number of drugs have been evaluated since the beginning of  the pandemic, and many of them have been used for the treatment of COVID-19  despite the preliminary or conflicting results of the clinical trials. We aimed  to review and summarize all of the current knowledge on the antivirals for  COVID-19 RESULTS: There are 2 main drug groups for SARS-CoV-2: agents that target  proteins or RNA of the virus or interfere with proteins or biological processes  in the host that support the virus. The main drug groups include inhibitors of  viral entry into the human cell (convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies,  nanobodies, mini proteins, human soluble ACE-2, camostat, dutasteride,  proxalutamide, bromhexin, hydroxychloroquine, umifenovir nitazoxanid,  niclosamide, lactoferrin), inhibitors of viral proteases (lopinavir/ritonavir,  PF-07321332, PF-07304814, GC376), inhibitors of viral RNA (remdesivir,  favipiravir, molnupiravir, AT-527, merimepodib, PTC299), inhibitors of host  proteins supporting virus (plitidepsin, fluvoxamine, ivermectin), and agents  supporting host natural immunity (Interferons). CONCLUSION: When taking into  account the results of all the available laboratory and clinical trials on the  subject, monoclonal antibodies seem to be the most effective treatment for  COVID-19 at the moment, and high-titer convalescent plasma also could be  effective when administered during the early phase of the disease. As  lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, merimepodib, and umifenovir were found  to be ineffective in RCTs, they should not be used. Additional studies are needed  to define the role of remdesivir, favipiravir, interferons, ivermectin,  dutasteride, proxulutamide, fluvoxamine, bromhexine, nitazoxanide, and niclosamid  in the treatment of COVID-19. Finally, the results of phase trials are waited to  learn whether or not the newer agents such as molnupiravir, PF-07321332,  PF-07304814, plitidepsin and AT-527 are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - A recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) started in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and then spread rapidly  all over the world. However, there are no specific antiviral therapies for  COVID-19, using the agents which approved or in development for other viral  infections is one of the potentially quickest ways to find treatment for this new  viral infection. Favipiravir is an effective agent that acts as a nucleotide  analog that selectively inhibits the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase or causes  lethal mutagenesis upon incorporation into the virus RNA. In view of recent  studies and discussion on favipiravir, in this mini review we aimed to summarize  the clinical trials studying the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in patients  with COVID-19.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, a newly emerged pathogen in December 2019, marked as one of the highly pathogenic Coronavirus, and altogether this is the third coronavirus  attack that crossed the species barrier. As of 1(st) July 2020, it is spreading  around 216 countries, areas or territories, and a total of 10,185,374 and 503,862  confirmed cases and death reports, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 virus entered  into the target cells by binding with the hACE2 receptors. Spike glycoprotein  promotes the entry of the virus into host target cells. Literature reported a  significant mutation in receptor binding sites and membrane proteins of the  previous SARS-CoV to turned as SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for most dreadful  pandemic COVID-19. These modifications may be the probable reason for the extreme  transmission and pathogenicity of the virus. A hasty spread of COVID-19  throughout the world is highly threatening, but still, scientists do not have a  proper therapeutic measure to fight with it. Scientists are endeavoring across  the world to find effective therapy to combat COVID 19. Several drugs such as  Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine, Ribavirin, Ritonavir, Lopinavir,  Favipiravir, Interferons, Bevacizumab, Azithromycin, etc. are currently under  clinical trials. Vaccine development from various pharmaceutical companies and  research institutes is under progress, and more than ten vaccine candidates are  in the various phases of clinical trials. This review work highlighted the  origin, emergence, structural features, pathogenesis, and clinical features of  COVID-19. We have also discussed the in-line treatment strategies, preventive  measures, and vaccines to combat the emergence of COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19, an infectious disease, has emerged as one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making it one of the severe public health issues in recent  decades. nCoV, the novel SARS coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has brought  together scientists in the quest for possible therapeutic and preventive  measures. The development of new drugs to manage COVID-19 effectively is a  challenging and time-consuming process, thus encouraging extensive investigation  of drug repurposing and repositioning candidates. Several medications, including  remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, favipiravir, ribavirin,  ritonavir, interferons, azithromycin, capivasertib and bevacizumab, are currently  under clinical trials for COVID-19. In addition, several medicinal plants with  considerable antiviral activities are potential therapeutic candidates for  COVID-19. Statistical data show that the pandemic is yet to slow down, and  authorities are placing their hopes on vaccines. Within a short period, four  types of vaccines, namely, whole virus, viral vector, protein subunit, and  nucleic acid (RNA/DNA), which can confer protection against COVID-19 in different  ways, were already in a clinical trial. SARS-CoV-2 variants spread is associated  with antibody escape from the virus Spike epitopes, which has grave concerns for  viral re-infection and even compromises the effectiveness of the vaccines.  Despite these efforts, COVID-19 treatment is still solely based on clinical  management through supportive care. We aim to highlight the recent trends in  COVID-19, relevant statistics, and clinical findings, as well as potential  therapeutics, including in-line treatment methods, preventive measures, and  vaccines to combat the prevalence of COVID-19.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak all over the world has led the researchers to strive to develop drugs or vaccines to prevent or halt the  progression of this ailment. To hasten the treatment process, repurposed drugs  are being evaluated. Favipiravir is one such oral drug that was approved for new  and reemerging pandemic influenza in Japan in 2014 and has shown potent in vitro  activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. It has a wide  therapeutic safety margin indicated by a wide CC50/EC50 ratio for a high dose.  From the clinical studies in COVID-19, it has shown rapid viral clearance as  compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) and superior recovery rate than  umifenovir. Overall, favipiravir has shown promising results in clinical studies  in China, Russia, and Japan, and more trials are underway in multiple countries,  including USA, UK, and India. Recently, treatment guidelines from many countries  and some states from India have included favipiravir in the treatment protocol.  This review provides insights into the evidence-based evolving role of  favipiravir in the management of COVID-19 infection with emphasis on benefits of  initiating an early antiviral therapy with special focus on favipiravir, its  pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, in vitro, clinical data, and inclusion in the  treatment protocols of COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic needs no introduction at present. Only a few treatments are available for this disease, including remdesivir and favipiravir. Accordingly,  the pharmaceutical industry is striving to develop new treatments for COVID-19.  Molnupiravir, an orally active RdRp inhibitor, is in a phase 3 clinical trial  against COVID-19. The objective of this review article is to enlighten the  researchers working on COVID-19 about the discovery, recent developments, and  patents related to molnupiravir. Molnupiravir was originally developed for the  treatment of influenza at Emory University, USA. However, this drug has also  demonstrated activity against a variety of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Now it  is being jointly developed by Emory University, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, and  Merck to treat COVID-19. The published clinical data indicate a good safety  profile, tolerability, and oral bioavailability of molnupiravir in humans. The  patient-compliant oral dosage form of molnupiravir may hit the market in the  first or second quarter of 2022. The patent data of molnupiravir revealed its  granted compound patent and process-related patent applications. We also  anticipate patent filing related to oral dosage forms, inhalers, and a  combination of molnupiravir with marketed drugs like remdesivir, favipiravir, and  baricitinib. The current pandemic demands a patient compliant, safe, tolerable,  and orally effective COVID-19 treatment. The authors believe that molnupiravir  meets these requirements and is a breakthrough COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - SCOPE: In January 2021, the ESCMID Executive Committee decided to launch a new initiative to develop ESCMID guidelines on several COVID-19-related issues,  including treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: An ESCMID COVID-19 guidelines task  force was established by the ESCMID Executive Committee. A small group was  established, half appointed by the chair, and the remaining selected with an open  call. Each panel met virtually once a week. For all decisions, a simple majority  vote was used. A long list of clinical questions using the PICO (population,  intervention, comparison, outcome) format was developed at the beginning of the  process. For each PICO, two panel members performed a literature search with a  third panellist involved in case of inconsistent results. Voting was based on the  GRADE approach. QUESTIONS ADDRESSED BY THE GUIDELINE AND RECOMMENDATIONS: A  synthesis of the available evidence and recommendations is provided for each of  the 15 PICOs, which cover use of hydroxychloroquine, bamlanivimab alone or in  combination with etesevimab, casirivimab combined with imdevimab, ivermectin,  azithromycin and empirical antibiotics, colchicine, corticosteroids, convalescent  plasma, favipiravir, remdesivir, tocilizumab and interferon β-1a, as well as the  utility of antifungal prophylaxis and enoxaparin. In general, the panel  recommended against the use of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin,  colchicine and interferon β-1a. Conditional recommendations were given for the  use of monoclonal antibodies in high-risk outpatients with mild-moderate  COVID-19, and remdesivir. There was insufficient evidence to make a  recommendation for use of favipiravir and antifungal prophylaxis, and it was  recommended that antibiotics should not be routinely prescribed in patients with  COVID-19 unless bacterial coinfection or secondary infection is suspected or  confirmed. Tocilizumab and corticosteroids were recommended for treatment of  severe COVID-19 but not in outpatients with non-severe COVID-19. SCOPE: The aim  of the present guidance is to provide evidence-based recommendations for  management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More specifically,  the goal is to aid clinicians managing patients with COVID-19 at various levels  of severity including outpatients, hospitalized patients, and those admitted to  intensive care unit. Considering the composition of the panel, mostly clinical  microbiologists or infectious disease specialists with no pulmonology or  intensive care background, we focus only on pharmacological treatment and do not  give recommendations on oxygen supplement/support. Similarly, as no  paediatricians were included in the panel; the recommendations are only for adult  patients with COVID-19. Considering the current literature, no guidance was given  for special populations such as the immunocompromised.

AB  - We are living through an unprecedented crisis with the rapid spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide within a short time. The timely  availability of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes has enabled the scientific  community to study the origin, structures, and pathogenesis of the virus. The  pandemic has spurred research publication and resulted in an unprecedented number  of therapeutic proposals. Because the development of new drugs is time consuming,  several strategies, including drug repurposing and repositioning, are being  tested to treat patients with COVID-19. Researchers have developed several  potential vaccine candidates that have shown promise in phase II and III trials.  As of 12 November 2020, 164 candidate vaccines are in preclinical evaluation, and  48 vaccines are in clinical evaluation, of which four have cleared phase III  trials (Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2, Moderna's mRNA-1273, University of Oxford &  AstraZeneca's AZD1222, and Gamaleya's Sputnik V vaccine). Despite the acquisition  of a vast body of scientific information, treatment depends only on the clinical  management of the disease through supportive care. At the pandemic's 1-year mark,  we summarize current information on SARS-CoV-2 origin and biology, and advances  in the development of therapeutics. The updated information presented here  provides a comprehensive report on the scientific progress made in the past year  in understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology and therapeutics.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is declared as an international emergency in 2020. Its prevalence and fatality rate are rapidly increasing but the  medication options are still limited for this perilous disease. The emergent  outbreak of COVID-19 triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) keeps propagating globally. The present scenario has emphasized the  requirement for therapeutic opportunities to relive and overcome this latest  pandemic. Despite the fact, the deteriorating developments of COVID-19, there is  no drug certified to have considerable effects in the medical treatment for  COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 pandemic requests for the rapid testing of new  treatment approaches. Based on the evidence, hydroxychloroquine is the first  medicine opted for the treatment of disease. Umifenovir, remdesivir, and  fevipiravir are deemed the most hopeful antiviral agent by improving the health  of infected patients. The dexamethasone is a first known steroid medicine that  can save the lives of seriously ill patients, and it is shown in a randomized  clinical trial by the United Kingdom that it reduced the death rate in COVID-19  patients. The current review recapitulates the existing evidence of possible  therapeutic drugs, peptides, humanized antibodies, convulsant plasma, and  vaccination that has revealed potential in fighting COVID-19 infections. Many  randomized and controlled clinical trials are taking place to further validate  these agent's safety and effectiveness in curing COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19 is announced as a global pandemic in 2020. Its mortality and morbidity rate are rapidly increasing, with limited medications. The emergent outbreak of  COVID-19 prompted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  keeps spreading. In this infection, a patient's immune response plays pivotal  role in the pathogenesis. This inflammatory factor was shown by its mediators  that, in severe cases, reach the cytokine at peaks. Hyperinflammatory state may  sparks significant imbalances in transporters and drug metabolic machinery, and  subsequent alteration of drug pharmacokinetics may result in unexpected  therapeutic response. The present scenario has accounted for the requirement for  therapeutic opportunities to relive and overcome this pandemic. Despite the  diminishing developments of COVID-19, there is no drug still approved to have  significant effects with no side effect on the treatment for COVID-19 patients.  Based on the evidence, many antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs have been  authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the COVID-19  patients even though not knowing the possible drug-drug interactions (DDI).  Remdesivir, favipiravir, and molnupiravir are deemed the most hopeful antiviral  agents by improving infected patient's health. Dexamethasone is the first known  steroid medicine that saved the lives of seriously ill patients. Some  oligopeptides and proteins have also been using. The current review summarizes  medication updates to treat COVID-19 patients in an inflammatory state and their  interaction with drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes. It gives an  opinion on the potential DDI that may permit the individualization of these  drugs, thereby enhancing the safety and efficacy.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents an  unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment.  Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the  large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate  evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. OBSERVATIONS:  No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly  expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number  of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir  has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug  Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized  trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are  currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in  patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic  represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and,  potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume  of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19  highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in  the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective to date.

AB  - No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir in treatment of  COVID-19. This was a multicenter randomized controlled study including 96  patients with COVID- 19 who were randomly assigned into a chloroquine (CQ) group  and a favipiravir group. None of the patients in the favipiravir group needed  mechanical ventilation (p = 0.129). One patient (2.3%) in the favipiravir group  and two patients (4.2%) in the CQ group died (p = 1.00). Favipiravir is a  promising drug for COVID-19 that decreases the hospital stay and the need for  mechanical ventilation.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04351295.

AB  - Reactive arthritis (ReA) is typically preceded by sexually transmitted disease or gastrointestinal infection. An association has also been reported with bacterial  and viral respiratory infections. Herein, we report the first case of ReA after  the he severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.  This male patient is in his 50s who was admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia. On the  second day of admission, SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive from nasopharyngeal swab  specimen. Despite starting standard dose of favipiravir, his respiratory  condition deteriorated during hospitalisation. On the fourth hospital day, he  developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and was intubated. On day 11, he  was successfully extubated, subsequently completing a 14-day course of  favipiravir. On day 21, 1 day after starting physical therapy, he developed acute  bilateral arthritis in his ankles, with mild enthesitis in his right Achilles  tendon, without rash, conjunctivitis, or preceding diarrhoea or urethritis.  Arthrocentesis of his left ankle revealed mild inflammatory fluid without  monosodium urate or calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Culture of synovial fluid was  negative. Plain X-rays of his ankles and feet showed no erosive changes or  enthesophytes. Tests for syphilis, HIV, anti-streptolysin O (ASO), Mycoplasma,  Chlamydia pneumoniae, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, anticyclic  citrullinated peptide antibody and Human Leukocyte Antigen-B27 (HLA-B27) were  negative. Gonococcal and Chlamydia trachomatis urine PCR were also negative. He  was diagnosed with ReA. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)s and  intra-articular corticosteroid injection resulted in moderate improvement.

AB  - Currently, there are no treatment options available for the deadly contagious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Drug repurposing is a process of  identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs and it is considered  as a very effective strategy for drug discovery as it involves less time and cost  to find a therapeutic agent in comparison to the de novo drug discovery process.  The present review will focus on the repurposing efficacy of the currently used  drugs against COVID-19 and their mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, dosing,  safety, and their future perspective. Relevant articles with experimental studies  conducted in-silico, in-vitro, in-vivo, clinical trials in humans, case reports,  and news archives were selected for the review. Number of drugs such as  remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, arbidol,  chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab and interferons have shown  inhibitory effects against the SARS-CoV2 in-vitro as well as in clinical  conditions. These drugs either act through virus-related targets such as RNA  genome, polypeptide packing and uptake pathways or target host-related pathways  involving angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors and inflammatory  pathways. Using the basic knowledge of viral pathogenesis and pharmacodynamics of  drugs as well as using computational tools, many drugs are currently in pipeline  to be repurposed. In the current scenario, repositioning of the drugs could be  considered the new avenue for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Favipiravir is an investigational antiviral drug in the US that is being tested for use against the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19. Information from one  patient indicates that milk levels are low with a peak level at about 2 hours.  One infant has reportedly been breastfed by a mother receiving favipiravir and  pumping her breasts after doses with no adverse effects reported in the infant.  Favipiravir has caused liver enzyme abnormalities, gastrointestinal symptoms, and  serum uric acid elevations.[1,2] If favipiravir is used in a nursing mother,  these parameters should be monitored in the breastfed infant.

AB  - An outbreak related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. An extremely  high potential for dissemination resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs  are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19  patients in large-scale studies. Remdesivir is considered the most promising  antiviral agent; it works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase (RdRp). A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of  remdesivir (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily) is on-going. The  other excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being  clinically evaluated for its efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The protease  inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) alone is not shown to provide better  antiviral efficacy than standard care. However, the regimen of LPV/RTV plus  ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in vitro. Another promising  alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg  on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2-5), which showed excellent  clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency  in vitro. The roles of teicoplanin (which inhibits the viral genome exposure in  cytoplasm) and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of  SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation. Avoiding the prescription of non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin  II type I receptor blockers is advised for COVID-19 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Favipiravir possesses high utility for treating patients with COVID-19. However, research examining the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for  patients with COVID-19 is limited. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of  published studies reporting the efficacy of favipiravir against COVID-19. Two  investigators independently searched PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic  Reviews, MedRxiv, and ClinicalTrials.gov (inception to September 2020) to  identify eligible studies. A meta-analysis was performed to measure viral  clearance and clinical improvement as the primary outcomes. RESULTS: Among 11  eligible studies, 5 included a comparator group. Comparing to the comparator  group, the favipiravir group exhibited significantly better viral clearance on  day 7 after the initiation of treatment (odds ratio [OR] = 2.49, 95% confidence  interval [CI] = 1.19-5.22), whereas no difference was noted on day 14 (OR = 2.19,  95% CI = 0.69-6.95). Although clinical improvement was significantly better in  the favipiravir group on both days 7 and 14, the improvement was better on day 14  (OR = 3.03, 95% CI = 1.17-7.80) than on day 7 (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.03-2.49).  The estimated proportions of patients with viral clearance in the favipiravir arm  on days 7 and 14 were 65.42 and 88.9%, respectively, versus 43.42 and 78.79%,  respectively, in the comparator group. The estimated proportions of patients with  clinical improvement on days 7 and 14 in the favipiravir group were 54.33 and  84.63%, respectively, compared with 34.40 and 65.77%, respectively, in the  comparator group. CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir induces viral clearance by 7 days and  contributes to clinical improvement within 14 days. The results indicated that  favipiravir has strong possibility for treating COVID-19, especially in patients  with mild-to-moderate illness. Additional well-designed studies, including  examinations of the dose and duration of treatment, are crucial for reaching  definitive conclusions.

AB  - Mutagenic ribonucleosides can act as broad-based antiviral agents. They are metabolized to the active ribonucleoside triphosphate form and concentrate in  genomes of RNA viruses during viral replication. β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC,  initial metabolite of molnupiravir) is >100-fold more active than ribavirin or  favipiravir against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),  with antiviral activity correlated to the level of mutagenesis in virion RNA.  However, NHC also displays host mutational activity in an animal cell culture  assay, consistent with RNA and DNA precursors sharing a common intermediate of a  ribonucleoside diphosphate. These results indicate highly active mutagenic  ribonucleosides may hold risk for the host.

AB  - In SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), the most common manifestations involve the upper airways; in complicated cases, bilateral interstitial pneumonia, severe  acute respiratory failure and multiple organ failure occur, which require  hospital treatment and ventilatory support with nasal cannula or mask and high  flow oxygen, or orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. There are no  specific antivirals, and thus management is symptomatic, as well as with  antiplatelet drugs (acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole), low molecular weight  heparin when there is hypercoagulability (increased D-dimer), dexamethasone when  inflammation indicators are elevated; experimentally, under informed consent,  antibiotics are used according to microbiological results, as well as interferon  beta 1b, favipiravir, tocilizumab, ivermectin and immunoglobulin G. When  gastroenteritis occurs, nitazoxanide can be indicated. En infección por  SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), las manifestaciones más comunes son las de vías aéreas  superiores; en casos complicados se presenta neumonía intersticial bilateral,  insuficiencia respiratoria aguda grave y falla orgánica múltiple que ameritan  tratamiento hospitalario y soporte ventilatorio por puntas nasales o mascarilla,  así como oxígeno con flujo a presión alta o intubación orotraqueal y ventilación  mecánica. No hay antivirales específicos por lo que el manejo es sintomático, así  como con antiplaquetarios (ácido acetilsalicílico, dipiridamol), heparina de bajo  peso molecular ante hipercoagulabilidad (dímero D aumentado), dexametasona ante  indicadores altos de inflamación. Previo consentimiento informado,  experimentalmente se emplean antibióticos según los resultados microbiológicos,  interferón beta 1b, favipiravir, tocilizumab, ivermectina e inmunoglobulina G.  Cuando se presenta gastroenteritis se puede indicar nitazoxanida.

AB  - The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic stresses the need for effective antiviral drugs that can quickly be applied in order to reduce morbidity, mortality, and ideally  viral transmission. By repurposing of broadly active antiviral drugs and  compounds that are known to inhibit viral replication of related viruses, several  advances could be made in the development of treatment strategies against  COVID-19. The nucleoside analog remdesivir, which is known for its potent in  vitro activity against Ebolavirus and other RNA viruses, was recently shown to  reduce the time to recovery in patients with severe COVID-19. It is to date the  only approved antiviral for treating COVID-19. Here, we provide a mechanism and  evidence-based comparative review of remdesivir and other repurposed drugs with  proven in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Nucleotide analog inhibitors, including broad-spectrum remdesivir and favipiravir, have shown promise in in vitro assays and some clinical studies for  COVID-19 treatment, this despite an incomplete mechanistic understanding of the  viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12 drug interactions. Here, we examine the  molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication by determining the cryo-EM  structures of the stalled pre- and post- translocated polymerase complexes.  Compared with the apo complex, the structures show notable structural  rearrangements happening to nsp12 and its co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 to accommodate  the nucleic acid, whereas there are highly conserved residues in nsp12,  positioning the template and primer for an in-line attack on the incoming  nucleotide. Furthermore, we investigate the inhibition mechanism of the  triphosphate metabolite of remdesivir through structural and kinetic analyses. A  transition model from the nsp7-nsp8 hexadecameric primase complex to the  nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 polymerase complex is also proposed to provide clues for the  understanding of the coronavirus transcription and replication machinery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the rapid, global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, hospitals have become inundated with patients suffering from  coronavirus disease 2019. Consultation-liaison psychiatrists are actively  involved in managing these patients and should familiarize themselves with how  the virus and its proposed treatments can affect psychotropic management. The  only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug to treat COVID-19 is remdesivir,  and other off-label medications used include chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine,  tocilizumab, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, convalescent plasma therapy,  azithromycin, vitamin C, corticosteroids, interferon, and colchicine. OBJECTIVE:  To provide an overview of the major safety considerations relevant to clinicians  who prescribe psychotropics to patients with COVID-19, both related to the  illness and its proposed treatments. METHODS: In this targeted review, we  performed structured literature searches in PubMed to identify articles  describing the impacts of COVID-19 on different organ systems, the  neuropsychiatric adverse effects of treatments, and any potential drug  interactions with psychotropics. The articles most relevant to this one were  included. RESULTS: COVID-19 impacts multiple organ systems, including  gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological, and  hematological systems. This may lead to pharmacokinetic changes that impact  psychotropic medications and increase sensitivity to psychotropic-related adverse  effects. In addition, several proposed treatments for COVID-19 have  neuropsychiatric effects and potential interactions with commonly used  psychotropics. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the need to adjust  existing psychotropics or avoid using certain medications in some patients with  COVID-19. They should also be familiar with neuropsychiatric effects of  medications being used to treat this disease. Further research is needed to  identify strategies to manage psychiatric issues in this population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in adults with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In this  randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, multicenter, phase 3 trial, adults (18-75  years) with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and mild-to-moderate symptoms (including  asymptomatic) were randomized 1:1 to oral favipiravir (day 1: 1800 mg BID and  days 2-14: 800 mg BID) plus standard supportive care versus supportive care  alone. The primary endpoint was time to the cessation of viral shedding; time to  clinical cure was also measured. RESULTS: From May 14 to July 3, 2020, 150  patients were randomized to favipiravir (n = 75) or control (n = 75). Median time  to the cessation of viral shedding was 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 7 days) versus 7  days (95% CI: 5 days, 8 days), P = 0.129, and median time to clinical cure was 3  days (95% CI: 3 days, 4 days) versus 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 6 days), P = 0.030,  for favipiravir and control, respectively. Adverse events were observed in 36% of  favipiravir and 8% of control patients. One control patient died due to worsening  disease. CONCLUSION: The lack of statistical significance on the primary endpoint  was confounded by limitations of the RT-PCR assay. Significant improvement in  time to clinical cure suggests favipiravir may be beneficial in mild-to-moderate  COVID-19.

AB  - Outbreak and pandemic of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in 2019/2020 will challenge global health for the future. Because a vaccine against the virus will not be  available in the near future, we herein try to offer a pharmacological strategy  to combat the virus. There exists a number of candidate drugs that may inhibit  infection with and replication of SARS-CoV-2. Such drugs comprise inhibitors of  TMPRSS2 serine protease and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).  Blockade of ACE2, the host cell receptor for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and  inhibition of TMPRSS2, which is required for S protein priming may prevent cell  entry of SARS-CoV-2. Further, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and off-label  antiviral drugs, such as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, HIV protease  inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs arbidol and  favipiravir as well as antiviral phytochemicals available to date may limit  spread of SARS-CoV-2 and morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),  affecting more than seventeen million people around the world. Diagnosis and  treatment guidelines for clinicians caring for patients are needed. In the early  stage, we have issued "A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment  of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)"; now  there are many direct evidences emerged and may change some of previous  recommendations and it is ripe for develop an evidence-based guideline. We formed  a working group of clinical experts and methodologists. The steering group  members proposed 29 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19  covering the following areas: chemoprophylaxis, diagnosis, treatments, and  discharge management. We searched the literature for direct evidence on the  management of COVID-19, and assessed its certainty generated recommendations  using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation  (GRADE) approach. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of  ungraded consensus-based statement. Finally, we issued 34 statements. Among them,  6 were strong recommendations for, 14 were weak recommendations for, 3 were weak  recommendations against and 11 were ungraded consensus-based statement. They  covered topics of chemoprophylaxis (including agents and Traditional Chinese  Medicine (TCM) agents), diagnosis (including clinical manifestations, reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respiratory tract specimens,  IgM and IgG antibody tests, chest computed tomography, chest x-ray, and CT  features of asymptomatic infections), treatments (including lopinavir-ritonavir,  umifenovir, favipiravir, interferon, remdesivir, combination of antiviral drugs,  hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, interleukin-6 inhibitors, interleukin-1  inhibitors, glucocorticoid, qingfei paidu decoction, lianhua qingwen  granules/capsules, convalescent plasma, lung transplantation, invasive or  noninvasive ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), and  discharge management (including discharge criteria and management plan in  patients whose RT-PCR retesting shows SARS-CoV-2 positive after discharge). We  also created two figures of these recommendations for the implementation purpose.  We hope these recommendations can help support healthcare workers caring for  COVID-19 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An effective treatment option is not yet available for SARS-CoV2, which causes the COVID-19 pandemic and whose effects are felt more and  more every day. Ivermectin is among the drugs whose effectiveness in treatment  has been investigated. In this study; it was aimed to investigate the presence of  gene mutations that alter ivermectin metabolism and cause toxic effects in  patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and to evaluate the effectiveness and  safety of ivermectin use in the treatment of patients without mutation. MATERIALS  AND METHODS: Patients with severe COVID19 pneumonia were included in the study,  which was planned as a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind phase 3  study. Two groups, the study group and the control group, took part in the study.  Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg/day for 5 days in the form of a solution prepared for  enteral use added to the reference treatment protocol -hydroxychloroquine +  favipiravir + azithromycin- of patients included in the study group. Patients in  the control group were given only reference treatment with 3 other drugs without  ivermectin. The presence of mutations was investigated by performing sequence  analysis in the mdr1/abcab1 gene with the Sanger method in patients included in  the study group according to randomization. Patients with mutations were excluded  from the study and ivermectin treatment was not continued. Patients were followed  for 5 days after treatment. At the end of the treatment and follow-up period,  clinical response and changes in laboratory parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: A  total of 66 patients, 36 in the study group and 30 in the control group were  included in the study. Mutations affecting ivermectin metabolism was detected in  genetic tests of six (16.7%) patients in the study group and they were excluded  from the study. At the end of the 5-day follow-up period, the rate of clinical  improvement was 73.3% (22/30) in the study group and was 53.3% (16/30) in the  control group (p = 0.10). At the end of the study, mortality developed in 6  patients (20%) in the study group and in 9 (30%) patients in the control group  (p = 0.37). At the end of the follow-up period, the average peripheral capillary  oxygen saturation (SpO2) values of the study and control groups were found to be  93.5 and 93.0%, respectively. Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/FiO2 ratios were  determined as 236.3 ± 85.7 and 220.8 ± 127.3 in the study and control groups,  respectively. While the blood lymphocyte count was higher in the study group  compared to the control group (1698 ± 1438 and 1256 ± 710, respectively) at the  end of the follow-up period (p = 0.24); reduction in serum C-reactive protein  (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer levels was more pronounced in the study group  (p = 0.02, p = 0.005 and p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: According to the  findings obtained, ivermectin can provide an increase in clinical recovery,  improvement in prognostic laboratory parameters and a decrease in mortality rates  even when used in patients with severe COVID-19. Consequently, ivermectin should  be considered as an alternative drug that can be used in the treatment of  COVID-19 disease or as an additional option to existing protocols.

AB  - RATIONALE: Management of anxiety, delirium, and agitation cannot be neglected in coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Antipsychotics are usually used for the  pharmacological management of delirium, and confusion and behavioral  disturbances. The concurrent use of treatments for COVID-19 and antipsychotics  should consider eventual drug-drug interactions OBJECTIVE: To systematically  review evidence-based available on drug-drug interactions between COVID-19  treatments and antipsychotics. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Three databases were consulted:  Lexicomp® Drug Interactions, Micromedex® Solutions Drugs Interactions, and  Liverpool© Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. To acquire more  information on QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes (TdP), the CredibleMeds®  QTDrugs List was searched. The authors made a recommendation agreed to by  consensus. Additionally, a systematic review of drug-drug interactions between  antipsychotics and COVID-19 treatment was conducted. RESULTS: The main  interactions between COVID-19 drugs and antipsychotics are the risk of  QT-prolongation and TdP, and cytochromes P450 interactions. Remdesivir,  baricinitib, and anakinra can be used concomitantly with antipsychotics without  risk of drug-drug interaction (except for hematological risk with clozapine and  baricinitib). Favipiravir only needs caution with chlorpromazine and quetiapine.  Tocilizumab is rather safe to use in combination with antipsychotics. The most  demanding COVID-19 treatments for coadministration with antipsychotics are  chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir because of  the risk of QT prolongation and TdP and cytochromes interactions. The systematic  review provides highly probable drug interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir plus  quetiapine and ritonavir/indinavir plus risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians  prescribing antipsychotics should be aware of the likely risk of drug-drug  interaction with COVID-19 medication and may benefit from taking into account  present recommendations of use to preserve patient safety.

T2  - Expert opinion on therapeutic patents
AB  - Introduction: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic urgently demands for both prevention and treatment strategies. RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), which  has no counterpart in human cells, is an excellent target for drug development.  Given the time-consuming process of drug development, repurposing drugs approved  for other indications or at least successfully tested in terms of safety and  tolerability, is an attractive strategy to rapidly provide an effective  medication for severe COVID-19 cases.Areas covered: The currently available data  and upcominSg studies on RdRp which can be repurposed to halt SARS-CoV-2  replication, are reviewed.Expert opinion: Drug repurposing and design of novel  compounds are proceeding in parallel to provide a quick response and new specific  drugs, respectively. Notably, the proofreading SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease activity  could limit the potential for drugs designed as immediate chain terminators and  favor the development of compounds acting through delayed termination. While  vaccination is awaited to curb the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, even partially effective  drugs from repurposing strategies can be of help to treat severe cases of  disease. Considering the high conservation of RdRp among coronaviruses, an  improved knowledge of its activity in vitro can provide useful information for  drug development or drug repurposing to combat SARS-CoV-2 as well as future  pandemics.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 has several overlapping phases. Treatments to date have focused on the late stage of disease in hospital. Yet, the pandemic is by  propagated by the viral phase in out-patients. The current public health strategy  relies solely on vaccines to prevent disease.Methods: We searched the major  national registries, pubmed.org, and the preprint servers for all ongoing,  completed and published trial results.Results: As of 2/15/2021, we found 111  publications reporting findings on 14 classes of agents, and 9 vaccines. There  were 62 randomized controlled studies, the rest retrospective observational  analyses. Only 21 publications dealt with outpatient care. Remdesivir and high  titer convalescent plasma have emergency use authorization for hospitalized  patients in the U.S.A. There is also support for glucocorticoid treatment of the  COVID-19 respiratory distress syndrome. Monoclonal antibodies are authorized for  outpatients, but supply is inadequate to treat all at time of diagnosis.  Favipiravir, ivermectin, and interferons are approved in certain countries.Expert  Opinion: Vaccines and antibodies are highly antigen specific, and new SARS-Cov-2  variants are appearing. We call on public health authorities to authorize  treatments with known low-risk and possible benefit for outpatients in parallel  with universal vaccination.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a matter of global concern.  Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions  (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness)  likely increase the severity of COVID-19. Rheumatic manifestations such  as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals.  COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia  (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like  lupus and Sjogren's syndrome. Severe disease in a subset of patients may be  driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic  lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic  arthritis or adult-onset Still's disease. In the absence of high-quality evidence  in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate  potential therapies. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for  viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or  ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease. Preliminary evidence suggests  potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Antiviral drugs like  lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored. Cytokine  storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens.  Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with  rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids  during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used.  Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during  infection episodes as per standard practices. Development of a vaccine may be the  only effective long-term protection against this disease.Key Points• Patients  with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) may have features mimicking rheumatic  diseases, such as arthralgias, acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis,  leucopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and cytokine storm with features akin  to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.• Although preliminary results  may be encouraging, high-quality clinical trials are needed to better understand  the role of drugs commonly used in rheumatology like hydroxychloroquine and  tocilizumab in COVID-19.• Until further evidence emerges, it may be cautiously  recommended to continue glucocorticoids and other disease-modifying antirheumatic  drugs (DMARDs) in patients receiving these therapies, with discontinuation of  DMARDs during infections as per standard practice.

AB  - Currently, there is not any specific effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Although most of the COVID-19 patients have mild or moderate courses, up to  5%–10% can have severe, potentially life threatening course, there is an urgent  need for effective drugs. Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of  therapy. There have been more than 300 clinical trials going on, various  antiviral and immunomodulating agents are in various stages of evaluation for  COVID-19 in those trials and some of them will be published in the next couple of  months. Despite the urgent need to find an effective antiviral treatment for  COVID-19 through randomized controlled studies, certain agents are being used all  over the world based on either in-vitro or extrapolated evidence or observational  studies. The most frequently used agents both in Turkey and all over the world  including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and  remdesivir will be reviewed here .Nitazoxanide and ivermectin were also included  in this review as they have recently been reported to have an activity against  SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and are licensed for the treatment of some other human  infections.

AB  - Antiviral therapeutics is one effective avenue to control and end this devastating COVID-19 pandemic. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of  SARS-CoV-2 has been recognized as a valuable target of antivirals. However, the  cell-free SARS-CoV-2 RdRp biochemical assay requires the conversion of nucleotide  prodrugs into the active triphosphate forms, which regularly occurs in cells yet  is a complicated multiple-step chemical process in vitro, and thus hinders the  utility of this cell-free assay in the rapid discovery of RdRp inhibitors. In  addition, SARS-CoV-2 exoribonuclease provides the proof-reading capacity to viral  RdRp, thus creates relatively high resistance threshold of viral RdRp to  nucleotide analog inhibitors, which must be examined and evaluated in the  development of this class of antivirals. Here, we report a cell-based assay to  evaluate the efficacy of nucleotide analog compounds against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and  assess their tolerance to viral exoribonuclease-mediated proof-reading. By  testing seven commonly used nucleotide analog viral polymerase inhibitors,  Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, Ribavirin, Favipiravir, Penciclovir, Entecavir and  Tenofovir, we found that both Molnupiravir and Remdesivir showed the strong  inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with EC50 value of 0.22 μM and 0.67 μM,  respectively. Moreover, our results suggested that exoribonuclease nsp14  increases resistance of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors. We also  determined that Remdesivir presented the highest resistance to viral  exoribonuclease activity in cells. Therefore, we have developed a cell-based  SARS-CoV-2 RdRp assay which can be deployed to discover SARS-CoV-2 RdRp  inhibitors that are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The novel coronavirus outbreak began in late December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide, critically impacting public health systems. A number of already  approved and marketed drugs are being tested for repurposing, including  Favipiravir. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in  treatment of COVID-19 patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis.  This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported in accordance with the  PRISMA statement. We registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42020180032).  All clinical trials which addressed the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in  comparison to other control groups for treatment of patients with confirmed  infection with SARS-CoV2 were included. We searched electronic databases  including LitCovid/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scientific  Information Database up to 31 December 2020. We assessed the risk of bias of the  included studies using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. All analyses were  performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2, and the risk  ratio index was calculated. Egger and Begg test was used for assessing  publication bias. Nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results of  the meta-analysis revealed a significant clinical improvement in the Favipiravir  group versus the control group during seven days after hospitalization  (RR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41; P = 0.001). Viral clearance was more in 14 days  after hospitalization in Favipiravir group than control group, but this finding  marginally not significant (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25; P = 0.094). Requiring  supplemental oxygen therapy in the Favipiravir group was 7% less than the control  group, (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.67-1.28; P = 0.664). Transferred to ICU and adverse  events were not statistically different between two groups. The mortality rate in  the Favipiravir group was approximately 30% less than the control group, but this  finding not statistically significant. Favipiravir possibly exerted no  significant beneficial effect in the term of mortality in the general group of  patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. We should consider that perhaps the use  of antiviral once the patient has symptoms is too late and this would explain  their low efficacy in the clinical setting.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether favipiravir reduces the time to viral clearance as documented by negative RT-PCR results for severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 in mild cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared to  placebo. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blinded, multicentre, and  placebo-controlled trial, adults with PCR-confirmed mild COVID-19 were recruited  in an outpatient setting at seven medical facilities across Saudi Arabia.  Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either favipiravir 1800 mg  by mouth twice daily on day 1 followed by 800 mg twice daily (n = 112) or a  matching placebo (n = 119) for a total of 5 to 7 days. The primary outcome was  the effect of favipiravir on reducing the time to viral clearance (by PCR test)  within 15 days of starting the treatment compared to the placebo group. The trial  included the following secondary outcomes: symptom resolution, hospitalization,  intensive care unit admissions, adverse events, and 28-day mortality. RESULTS:  Two hundred thirty-one patients were randomized and began the study (median age,  37 years; interquartile range (IQR): 32-44 years; 155 [67%] male), and 112  (48.5%) were assigned to the treatment group and 119 (51.5%) into the placebo  group. The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrolment  because of futility at the interim analysis. The median time to viral clearance  was 10 days (IQR: 6-12 days) in the favipiravir group and 8 days (IQR: 6-12 days)  in the placebo group, with a hazard ratio of 0.87 for the favipiravir group (95%  CI 0.571-1.326; p = 0.51). The median time to clinical recovery was 7 days (IQR:  4-11 days) in the favipiravir group and 7 days (IQR: 5-10 days) in the placebo  group. There was no difference between the two groups in the secondary outcome of  hospital admission. There were no drug-related severe adverse events. CONCLUSION:  In this clinical trial, favipiravir therapy in mild COVID-19 patients did not  reduce the time to viral clearance within 15 days of starting the treatment.

T2  - Advances in chronic kidney disease
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019, the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, was first identified in the Hubei Province of China  in late 2019. Currently, the only role for therapy is treatment of the disease,  as opposed to postexposure prophylaxis, however multiple clinical trials are  currently ongoing for both treatment and prophylaxis. Treating coronavirus  disease 2019 relies on two components; the first is inhibition of the viral  entrance and replication within the body and the second is inhibition of an  exacerbated immune response which can be seen in patients with severe disease.  Many drugs have shown in vitro antiviral activity; however, clinical trials have  not been as promising. This review summarizes the current data for the most  commonly used drugs for coronavirus disease 2019 and will cover the unique  factors that may affect the dosing of these medications in patients with CKD.  While clinical trials are ongoing, most are in patients with normal kidney  function. During a pandemic, when patients with CKD are at higher risk of both  infection and death, it is imperative to include patients these patients in the  clinical trials.

AB  - In December 2019, a novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged, causing an outbreak of life-threatening pneumonia in the Hubei province, China, and has now spread  worldwide, causing a pandemic. The urgent need to control the disease, combined  with the lack of specific and effective treatment modalities, call for the use of  FDA-approved agents that have shown efficacy against similar pathogens.  Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin have all been  successful in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The initial results of a number of  clinical trials involving various protocols of administration of chloroquine or  hydroxychloroquine mostly point towards their beneficial effect. However, they  may not be effective in cases with persistently high viremia, while results on  ivermectin (another antiparasitic agent) are not yet available. Interestingly,  azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic in combination with hydroxychloroquine,  might yield clinical benefit as an adjunctive. The results of clinical trials  point to the potential clinical efficacy of antivirals, especially remdesivir  (GS-5734), lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir. Other therapeutic options that  are being explored involve meplazumab, tocilizumab, and interferon type 1. We  discuss a number of other drugs that are currently in clinical trials, whose  results are not yet available, and in various instances we enrich such efficacy  analysis by invoking historic data on the treatment of SARS, MERS, influenza, or  in vitro studies. Meanwhile, scientists worldwide are seeking to discover novel  drugs that take advantage of the molecular structure of the virus, its  intracellular life cycle that probably elucidates unfolded-protein response, as  well as its mechanism of surface binding and cell invasion, like angiotensin  converting enzymes-, HR1, and metalloproteinase inhibitors.

AB  - An escalating pandemic by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is impacting global health and effective therapeutic options are urgently needed. We evaluated the in vitro  antiviral effect of compounds that were previously reported to inhibit  coronavirus replication and compounds that are currently under evaluation in  clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 patients. We report the antiviral effect of  remdesivir, lopinavir, homorringtonine, and emetine against SARS-CoV-2 virus in  Vero E6 cells with the estimated 50% effective concentration at 23.15 μM,  26.63 μM, 2.55 μM and 0.46 μM, respectively. Ribavirin or favipiravir that are  currently evaluated under clinical trials showed no inhibition at 100 μM. Synergy  between remdesivir and emetine was observed, and remdesivir at 6.25 μM in  combination with emetine at 0.195 μM may achieve 64.9% inhibition in viral yield.  Combinational therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration of compounds  below the therapeutic plasma concentrations and provide better clinical benefits.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global public health crisis, for which antiviral treatments are considered mainstream  therapeutic approaches. With the development of this pandemic, the number of  clinical studies on antiviral therapy, including remdesivir, chloroquine and  hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, arbidol, interferon,  favipiravir, oseltamivir, nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, and camostat mesylate, has  been increasing. However, the efficacy of these antiviral drugs for COVID-19  remains controversial. In this review, we summarize the recent progress and  findings on antiviral therapies, aiming to provide clinical support for the  management of COVID-19. In addition, we analyze the causes of controversy in  antiviral drug research and discuss the quality of current studies on antiviral  treatments. High-quality randomized clinical trials are required to demonstrate  the efficacy and safety of antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus, known as the coronavirus pandemic, is continuing its spread across the world, with over 42 million confirmed cases in 189 countries and more than  1.15 million deaths. Although, scientists focus on the finding novel drugs and  vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, there is no certain treatment for it. Antiviral drugs  such as; oseltamivir, favipiravir, umifenovir, lopinavir, remdesivir,  hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, ascorbic acid, corticosteroids,  are mostly used for patients. They prevent cytokine storm that is the main reason  of deaths related to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, anti-inflammatory agents have  critical roles to inhibit the lung injury and multisystem organ dysfunction. The  combination with anti-viral drugs with other drugs displays high synergistic  effects. In the present study, the drugs used for Covid-19 are analyzed and  compare the efficiency for the Covid-19 patients from the different continents  including USA, South Korea, Italy, Spain, Germany, Russia, Brazil, Turkey, and  China. Nowadays, all countries tried to find vaccine and new drug candidates for  SARS-CoV-2, but anti-viral drugs may be the best candidates for the treatment of  Covid-19 before finding novel anti-Covid drug.

AB  - PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has affected millions all  over the world and has been declared pandemic, as of 11 March 2020. In addition  to the ongoing research and development of vaccines, there is still a dire need  for safe and effective drugs for the control and treatment against the SARS-CoV-2  virus infection. Numerous repurposed drugs are under clinical investigations  whose reported adverse events can raise worries about their safety. The aim of  this review is to illuminate the associated adverse events related to the drugs  used in a real COVID-19 setting along with their relevant mechanism(s). METHOD:  Through a literature search conducted on PubMed and Google Scholar database,  various adverse events suspected to be induced by eight drugs, including  dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir,  lopinavir/ritonavir, ivermectin, and tocilizumab, administered in COVID-19  patients in clinical practice and studies were identified in 30 case reports, 3  case series, and 10 randomized clinical trials. RESULTS: Mild, moderate, or  severe adverse events of numerous repurposed and investigational drugs caused by  various factors and mechanisms were observed. Gastrointestinal side effects such  as nausea, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting were the most frequently  followed by cardiovascular, cutaneous, and hepatic adverse events. Few other rare  adverse drug reactions were also observed. CONCLUSION: In light of their  ineffectiveness against COVID-19 as evident in large clinical studies, drugs  including hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ivermectin should neither  be used routinely nor in clinical studies. While lack of sufficient data, it  creates doubt regarding the reliability of chloroquine and favipiravir use in  COVID-19 patients. Hence, these two drugs can only be used in clinical studies.  In contrast, ample well-conducted studies have approved the use of remdesivir,  tocilizumab, and dexamethasone under certain conditions in COVID-19 patients.  Consequently, it is significant to establish a strong surveillance system in  order to monitor the proper safety and toxicity profile of the potential  anti-COVID-19 drugs with good clinical outcomes.

T2  - Environmental and molecular mutagenesis
AB  - This review considers antiviral nucleoside analog drugs, including ribavirin, favipiravir, and molnupiravir, which induce genome error catastrophe in SARS-CoV  or SARS-CoV-2 via lethal mutagenesis as a mode of action. In vitro data indicate  that molnupiravir may be 100 times more potent as an antiviral agent than  ribavirin or favipiravir. Molnupiravir has recently demonstrated efficacy in a  phase 3 clinical trial. Because of its anticipated global use, its relative  potency, and the reported in vitro "host" cell mutagenicity of its active  principle, β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine, we have reviewed the development of  molnupiravir and its genotoxicity safety evaluation, as well as the genotoxicity  profiles of three congeners, that is, ribavirin, favipiravir, and  5-(2-chloroethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine. We consider the potential genetic risks of  molnupiravir on the basis of all available information and focus on the need for  additional human genotoxicity data and follow-up in patients treated with  molnupiravir and similar drugs. Such human data are especially relevant for  antiviral NAs that have the potential of permanently modifying the genomes of  treated patients and/or causing human teratogenicity or embryotoxicity. We  conclude that the results of preclinical genotoxicity studies and phase 1 human  clinical safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics are critical components of  drug safety assessments and sentinels of unanticipated adverse health effects. We  provide our rationale for performing more thorough genotoxicity testing prior to  and within phase 1 clinical trials, including human PIG-A and error corrected  next generation sequencing (duplex sequencing) studies in DNA and mitochondrial  DNA of patients treated with antiviral NAs that induce genome error catastrophe  via lethal mutagenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on current evidence, recent guidelines of the National Institute of Health, USA indicated the use of remdesivir and dexamethasone for  the treatment of COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease, not requiring  high-flow oxygen. No therapeutic agent directed against the immunologic  pathogenic mechanisms related to the cytokine release syndrome complicating the  disease was indicated. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review was to assess the  clinical impact of different therapies for COVID-19; thus, helping to identify  the optimal management of the disease. To explain the rationale for the different  therapeutic approaches, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenesis of  COVID-19, and the immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection were  reported. METHODS: The efficacy assessment of the different treatments was  performed by a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Available English language  published articles including randomised controlled trials, open-label trials of  antivirals and immune therapies extracted from Medline, Google Scholar, and  MedRxiv databases were analysed. For inclusion, the primary end point of the  trials had to be the efficacy as measured by the improvement of clinical  features, or mortality, or the Intensive Care Unit Admission rate, or the  discharge number. Case reports, paediatric studies, and studies without control  group were excluded. The literature search was extended up to August 15, 2020.  RESULTS: After the removal of duplicate articles, and the exclusion of studies  not meeting the eligibility criteria, 2 trials of lopinavir/ritonavir, 1 of  favipiravir, 3 of remdesivir, 1 of dexamethasone, 3 of hydroxychloroquine, 2 of  colchicine, 6 of tocilizumab, 1 of sarilumab, 1 of siltuximab, 2 of anakinra, 3  of baricitinib, 1 of ruxolitinib, 1 of mavrilimumab, and 1 of itolizumab were  suitable for the review. Among antivirals, only remdesivir significantly reduced  the time to recovery, and mortality. Data for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine  were largely inconclusive. In a large trial, dexamethasone 6 mg/day reduced  mortality by one-third. Trials of tocilizumab and sarilumab did not definitively  demonstrate efficacy. Anakinra significantly reduced the mortality in 2 trials.  Three retrospective trials on a cumulative number of 145 patients, reported the  efficacy of baricitinib, with significant reduction of intensive care unit  admission, and deaths. These results were recently confirmed by the ACTT-2 trial.  Due to paucity of studies and to the small size clinical series, the results of  other immune therapies were not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the supportive  therapy, up to now the best therapeutic approach for COVID-19 may be a three-step  combination therapy, including remdesivir 100 mg/day (200 mg loading dose on  first day) in the first stage of the disease, and combined dexamethasone 6 mg/day  plus baricitinib 4 mg/day to target the immune dysregulation triggered by the  SARS-CoV-2 infection. The promising results of anakinra should be confirmed by  the ongoing RCTs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rising number of infections due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (popularly known as COVID-19) has brought to the fore new  antiviral drugs as possible treatments, including favipiravir. However, there is  currently no data regarding the safety of this drug in patients with kidney  impairment. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to share our experience of the  use of favipiravir in pediatric patients affected by COVID-19 with any degree of  kidney impairment. METHODS: The study enrolled pediatric patients aged under 18  years and confirmed as suffering from COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory  syndrome in children (MIS-C) with any degree of kidney injury, who were treated  with favipiravir at the time of admission. RESULTS: Out of a total of 11  patients, 7 were diagnosed with MIS-C and 4 with severe COVID-19. The median age  of the cases was 15.45 (9-17.8) years and the male/female ratio was 7/4. At the  time of admission, the median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl. Nine patients  were treated with favipiravir for 5 days, and 2 patients for 5 days followed by  remdesivir for 5-10 days despite kidney injury at the time of admission. Seven  patients underwent plasma exchange for MIS-C while 2 severely affected cases  underwent continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) as well. One severe  COVID-19 patient received plasma exchange as well as CKRT. Serum creatinine  values returned to normal in mean 3.07 days. CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir seems a  suitable therapeutic option in patients affected by COVID-19 with kidney injury  without a need for dose adjustment.

AB  - We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis for the effectiveness of Favipiravir on the fatality and the requirement of mechanical ventilation for the  treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. We searched available  literature and reported it by using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Until June 1, 2021, we searched  PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central Register of  Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Google Scholar by using the keywords  "Favipiravir" and terms synonymous with COVID-19. Studies for Favipiravir  treatment compared to standard of care among moderate and severe COVID-19  patients were included. Risk of bias assessment was performed using Revised  Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and ROBINS-I assessment  tool for non-randomized studies. We defined the outcome measures as fatality and  requirement for mechanical ventilation. A total of 2702 studies were  identified and 12 clinical trials with 1636 patients were analyzed. Nine out of  12 studies were randomized controlled trials. Among the randomized studies, one  study has low risk of bias, six studies have moderate risk of bias, and 2 studies  have high risk of bias. Observational studies were identified as having moderate  risk of bias and non-randomized study was found to have serious risk of bias. Our  meta-analysis did not reveal any significant difference between the intervention  and the comparator on fatality rate (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.64-1.94) and mechanical  ventilation requirement (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13-1.95). There is no significant  difference in fatality rate and mechanical ventilation requirement between  Favipiravir treatment and the standard of care in moderate and severe COVID-19  patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with solid malignancies are more vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection than the healthy  population. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in highly immunosuppressed  populations, such as in patients with hematological malignancies, is a point of  interest. We aimed to analyze the symptoms, complications, intensive care unit  admissions, and mortality rates of patients with hematological malignancies  infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this multicenter  study, we included 340 adult and pediatric patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2  from March to November 2020. Diagnosis and status of primary disease, treatment  schedules for hematological malignancies, time from last treatment, life  expectancy related to the hematological disease, and comorbidities were recorded,  together with data regarding symptoms, treatment, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2  infection. RESULTS: Forty four patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis of  SARS-CoV- 2 infection. Among symptomatic patients, fever, cough, and dyspnea were  observed in 62.6%, 48.8%, and 41.8%, respectively. Sixty-nine (20%) patients had  mild SARS-CoV-2 disease, whereas moderate, severe, and critical disease was  reported in 101 (29%), 71 (20%), and 55 (16%) patients, respectively. Of the  entire cohort, 251 (73.8%) patients were hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2. Mortality  related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 26.5% in the entire cohort; this comprised  4.4% of those patients with mild disease, 12.4% of those with moderate disease,  and 83% of those with severe or critical disease. Active hematological disease,  lower life expectancy related to primary hematological disease, neutropenia at  diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, ICU admission, and first-line therapy used for  coronavirus disease-2019 treatment were found to be related to higher mortality  rates. Treatments with hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with  azithromycin were associated with a higher rate of mortality in comparison to  favipiravir use. CONCLUSION: Patients with hematological malignancy infected with  SARS-CoV-2 have an increased risk of severe disease and mortality.

AB  - In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of quercetin in combination with remdesivir and favipiravir, were evaluated in severe hospitalized COVID-19  patients. Our main objective was to assess the ability of quercetin for  preventing the progression of the disease into critical phase, and reducing the  levels of inflammatory markers related to SARS-Cov-2 pathogenesis. Through an  open-label clinical trial, 60 severe cases were randomly divided into control and  intervention groups. During a 7-day period, patients in the control group  received antivirals, i.e., remdesivir or favipiravir, while the intervention  group was treated with 1000 mg of quercetin daily in addition to the antiviral  drugs. According to the results, taking quercetin was significantly associated  with partial earlier discharge and reduced serum levels of ALP, q-CRP, and LDH in  the intervention group. Furthermore, although the values were in normal range,  the statistical outputs showed significant increase in hemoglobin level and  respiratory rate in patients who were taking quercetin. Based on our  observations, quercetin is safe and effective in lowering the serum levels of  ALP, q-CRP, and LDH as critical markers involved in COVID-19 severity. However,  according to the non-significant borderline results in comparing the mortality,  the ICU-admission rate, and the duration of ICU-admission, further studies can be  helpful to compensate the limitations of our study and clarify the therapeutic  potential of quercetin in COVID-19 treatments.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began, resulting in a number of antivirals  and immune modulators being repurposed to treat the associated coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many patients requiring treatment for COVID-19 may have  either pre-existing renal or hepatic disease or experience acute renal/hepatic  injury as a result of the acute infection. Altered renal or hepatic function can  significantly affect drug concentrations of medications due to impaired drug  metabolism and excretion, resulting in toxicity or reduced efficacy. The aim of  this paper is to review the pharmacokinetics and available study data for the  experimental COVID-19 therapies in patients with any degree of renal or hepatic  impairment to make recommendations for dosing. METHODS: COVID-19 agents included  in these recommendations were listed as primaries on the University of Liverpool  COVID-19 drug interaction website ( www.covid19-druginteractions.org ), initially  identified from Clinicialtrials.gov and ChicCTR.org.cn. A literature search was  performed using PubMed and EMBASE as well as product licences and pharmacokinetic  databases. FINDINGS: Remdesivir, dexamethasone, azithromycin, favipiravir,  lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir, hydroxychloroquine, interferon beta, ribavirin,  tocilizumab, anakinra and sarilumab were identified as experimental drugs being  used in COVID-19 trials as of November 2020. Limited study data was found for  these drugs in patients with renal or hepatic impairment for COVID-19 or other  indications. Recommendations were made based on available data, consideration of  pharmacokinetic properties (including variability), the dosing and anticipated  treatment duration of each regimen in COVID-19 and known toxicities. CONCLUSION:  Dosing of drugs used to treat COVID-19 in patients with renal or hepatic  impairment is complex. These recommendations were produced to provide guidance to  clinicians worldwide who are treating patients with COVID-19, many of whom will  have some degree of acute or chronic renal or hepatic impairment.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the late 2019 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a respiratory  disease which could put myasthenia gravis (MG) patients at a greater risk of  developing severe disease course, since infections and some drugs are a  well-recognized trigger of symptom exacerbation in MG patients. Out of ten most  commonly used past and present drugs used in COVID-19 treatment, two (quinolone  derivatives and azithromycin) are known to worsen MG symptoms, whereas another  two (tocilizumab and eculizumab) might have positive effect on MG symptoms.  Colchicine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir seem to be safe to  use, while data are insufficient for bamlanivimab, although it is also probably  safe to use. Considering MG treatment options in patients infected with  SARS-CoV-2, acetylcholine esterase inhibitors are generally safe to use with some  preliminary studies even demonstrating therapeutic properties in regard to  COVID-19. Corticosteroids are in general safe to use, even recommended in  specific circumstances, whereas other immunosuppressive medications  (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate) are probably  safe to use. The only exception is rituximab since the resulting B cell depletion  can lead to more severe COVID-19 disease. Concerning plasmapheresis and  intravenous immunoglobulins, both can be used in COVID-19 while taking into  consideration thromboembolic properties of the former and hemodynamic  disturbances of the latter. As current data suggest, all known COVID-19 vaccines  are safe to use in MG patients.

AB  - Favipiravir is an oral broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is approved for treatment of influenza in Japan. We conducted a  prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of favipiravir for the  treatment of COVID-19 at 25 hospitals across Japan. Eligible patients were  adolescents and adults admitted with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic or mildly ill  and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or  1. Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to early or late favipiravir  therapy (in the latter case, the same regimen starting on day 6 instead of day  1). The primary endpoint was viral clearance by day 6. The secondary endpoint was  change in viral load by day 6. Exploratory endpoints included time to  defervescence and resolution of symptoms. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled, of  whom 69 were virologically evaluable. Viral clearance occurred within 6 days in  66.7% and 56.1% of the early and late treatment groups (adjusted hazard ratio  [aHR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.76 to 2.62). Of 30 patients who  had a fever (≥37.5°C) on day 1, times to defervescence were 2.1 days and 3.2 days  in the early and late treatment groups (aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.81 to 4.35). During  therapy, 84.1% developed transient hyperuricemia. Favipiravir did not  significantly improve viral clearance as measured by reverse transcription-PCR  (RT-PCR) by day 6 but was associated with numerical reduction in time to  defervescence. Neither disease progression nor death occurred in any of the  patients in either treatment group during the 28-day participation. (This study  has been registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials under number  jRCTs041190120.).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 is mostly symptomatic, but a wide range of medications are under investigation against severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although pregnant women are excluded from  clinical trials, they will inevitably receive therapies whenever they seem  effective in nonpregnant patients and even under compassionate use. METHODS: We  conducted a review of the literature on placental transfer and pregnancy safety  data of drugs under current investigation for coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS:  Regarding remdesivir, there are no data in pregnant women. Several other  candidates already have safety data in pregnant women, because they are  repurposed drugs already used for their established indications. Thus, they may  be used in pregnancy, although their safety in the context of coronavirus disease  2019 may differ from conventional use. These include HIV protease inhibitors such  as lopinavir/ritonavir that have low placental transfer, interferon that does not  cross the placental barrier, and hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine that has high  placental transfer. There are also pregnancy safety and placental transfer data  for colchicine, steroids, oseltamivir, azithromycin, and some monoclonal  antibodies. However, some drugs are strictly prohibited in pregnancy because of  known teratogenicity (thalidomide) or fetal toxicities (renin-angiotensin system  blockers). Other candidates including tocilizumab, other interleukin 6  inhibitors, umifenovir, and favipiravir have insufficient data on pregnancy  outcomes. CONCLUSION: In life-threatening cases of coronavirus disease 2019, the  potential risks of therapy to the fetus may be more than offset by the benefit of  curing the mother. Although preclinical and placental transfer studies are  required for a number of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 drugs, several medications can already be used in pregnant women.

AB  - Favipiravir is considered a potential treatment for COVID-19 due its efficacy against different viral infections. We aimed to explore the safety and efficacy  of favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 mild and moderate cases. It was  randomized-controlled open-label interventional phase 3 clinical trial  [NCT04349241]. 100 patients were recruited from 18th April till 18th May. 50  patients received favipiravir 3200 mg at day 1 followed by 600 mg twice (day  2-day 10). 50 patients received hydroxychloroquine 800 mg at day 1 followed by  200 mg twice (day 2-10) and oral oseltamivir 75 mg/12 h/day for 10 days. Patients  were enrolled from Ain Shams University Hospital and Assiut University Hospital.  Both arms were comparable as regards demographic characteristics and  comorbidities. The average onset of SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity was 8.1 and  8.3 days in HCQ-arm and favipiravir-arm respectively. 55.1% of those on HCQ-arm  turned PCR negative at/or before 7th day from diagnosis compared to 48% in  favipiravir-arm (p = 0.7). 4 patients in FVP arm developed transient  transaminitis on the other hand heartburn and nausea were reported in about 20  patients in HCQ-arm. Only one patient in HCQ-arm died after developing acute  myocarditis resulted in acute heart failure. Favipiravir is a safe effective  alternative for hydroxychloroquine in mild or moderate COVID-19 infected  patients.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in December 2019 and has  rapidly spread globally. As the confirmed number of cases has reached 83 million  worldwide, the potential severity and the deadly complications of the disease  requires urgent development of effective drugs for prevention and treatment. No  proven effective treatment for this virus currently exists. Most of the antiviral  discovery efforts are focused on the repurposing of approved or clinical stage  drugs. This review highlights the small-molecule repurposed antiviral agents that  are currently under investigation in clinical trials for COVID-19. These include  viral polymerase and protease inhibitors remdesivir, galidesivir, favipiravir,  ribavirin, sofosbuvir, tenofovir/emtricitabine, baloxavir marboxil, EIDD-2801,  lopinavir/ritonavir; virus-/host-directed viral entry and fusion inhibitors  arbidol chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, chlorpromazine, camostat mesylate,  nafamostat mesylate, bromhexine and agents with diverse/unclear mechanism of  actions as oseltamivir, triazavirin, ivermectin, nitazoxanide, niclosamide and  BLD-2660. The published preclinical and clinical data to date on these drugs as  well as the mechanisms of action are reviewed.

AB  - Favipiravir has antiviral activity against influenza, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus and against flaviviruses. The objective of this pilot study was to  compare three arms: favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; standard care (no specific  SARS-CoV-2 treatment) only, in symptomatic patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in an  open-labelled randomized clinical trial. The trial was registered with Bahrain  National Taskforce for Combatting COVID-19 on the 7th of May 2020 (registration  code: NCT04387760). 150 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 disease were  randomized into one of three arms: favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, or standard  care only. The primary outcome was the clinical scale at the end of study follow  up (day 14 or on discharge/death) based on a points scale. The secondary outcomes  were viral clearance, biochemical parameter changes and mortality at 30-days.  Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. The proportion of  patients who achieved a clinical scale < 2 did not differ between groups. The  favipiravir-treated and hydroxychloroquine-treated group showed increased viral  clearance (OR, 95%CI 2.38, 0.83-6.78, OR, 95%CI 2.15, 0.78-5.92, respectively)  compared to standard care, but this was not significant. The biochemical profile  did not differ between groups, except for the platelet count (P < 0.03) and uric  acid (P < 0.004) that were higher with favipiravir-treatment. Primary or  secondary outcome measures did not differ between favipiravir,  hydroxychloroquine, and standard therapy for mild to moderate COVID-19 disease;  therefore, whilst favipiravir therapy appeared safe with a trend to increased  viral clearance, there was no superior therapeutic utility.Clinical trials  registration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with psychiatric comorbidities leads to a scenario in which the use of psychotropic drugs may be required. This requires  the support of evidence-based medicine to take into account possible interactions  between antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, and coronavirus  infection treatments. METHODS: Three databases were consulted: (a) Lexicomp Drug  Interactions, (b) Micromedex Solutions Drugs Interactions, (c)Liverpool Drug  Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. The CredibleMeds QTDrugs List was also  queried. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir,  remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, anakinra, and dexamethasone -  drugs used for SARS-CoV-2 - were analyzed, and consensus recommendations are  made. RESULTS: The potential interactions of agomelatine, desvenlafaxine,  duloxetine, milnacipran, and vortioxetine with COVID-19 treatments shall be  considered less risky. Antidepressant interactions with hydroxychloroquine,  chloroquine, and azithromycin enhance the risk of QT prolongation, and ECG  monitoring is advised for most antidepressants. Antidepressants with  lopinavir/ritonavir involve multiple CYP enzyme interactions (except with  milnacipran). Gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, topiramate, and zonisamide  are safe treatment options that have no significant interactions with COVID-19  treatments. Lithium is contraindicated with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and  azithromycin. Precaution should be taken in using valproic acid with  lopinavir-ritonavir. The use of benzodiazepines does not present a risk of drug  interaction with COVID-19 treatments, except lopinavir/ritonavir. CONCLUSIONS:  Clinicians prescribing antidepressants, mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants, and  benzodiazepines, should be aware of the probable risk of drug-drug interaction  with COVID-19 medications and may benefit from heeding these recommendations for  use to ensure patient safety.

AB  - Mefenamic acid is a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug exhibiting a wide range of anti‑inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and probable antiviral activities.  The present study evaluated the efficacy of treatment with mefenamic acid  combined with standard medical care vs. standard medical care plus a placebo in  ambulatory patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19; nasal/oropharyngeal  swabs reverse transcription‑PCR test results positive for severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The present study is a phase II prospective,  two‑arm, parallel‑group, randomized, double‑blind placebo‑controlled clinical  trial which analyzed 36 patients. Two aspects were evaluated during the 14‑day  follow‑up period: i) The time for reaching a patient acceptable symptom state  (PASS), and ii) the last day of each COVID‑19 symptom presentation. Adverse  effects were evaluated. The clinical severity for all the patients in the study  was mild (88.9%) and moderate (11.1%). The control (placebo) group achieved PASS  on day 8.0±1.3, compared with day 4.4±0.8 in the mefenamic acid group (P=0.020,  Kaplan‑Meier analyses using log‑rank tests). Patients that received mefenamic  acid plus standard medical care had a ~16‑fold higher probability of achieving  PASS on day 8 (adjusted RR, 15.57; 95% CI, 1.22‑198.71; P=0.035), compared with  the placebo plus standard medical care group. All symptoms lasted for fewer days  in the mefenamic acid group, compared with the placebo group; however, only the  symptoms of headache (P=0.008), retro‑orbital eye pain (P=0.049), and sore throat  (P=0.029) exhibited statistically significant differences. The experimental  treatment produced no severe adverse effects. On the whole, the present study  demonstrates that the administration of mefenamic acid markedly reduced the  symptomatology and time to reach PASS in ambulatory patients with COVID‑19. Due  to its probable antiviral effects and potent anti‑inflammatory mechanisms,  mefenamic acid may prove to be useful in the treatment of COVID‑19, in  combination with other drugs, including the new antivirals (remdesivir,  molnupiravir, or favipiravir). However, future studies are also required to  confirm these findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics and treatment of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 after recovery remained elusive. Effective antiviral  therapy is important for tackling these patients. We assessed the efficacy and  safety of favipiravir for treating these patients. METHODS: This is a  multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial in SARS-CoV-2 RNA  re-positive patients. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive  either favipiravir, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The  primary outcome was time to achieve a consecutive twice (at intervals of more  than 24 h) negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab and  sputum sample. RESULTS: Between March 27 and May 9, 2020, 55 patients underwent  randomization; 36 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 19 were assigned to  the control group. Favipiravir group had a significantly shorter time from start  of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab and sputum than control group  (median 17 vs. 26 days); hazard ratio 2.1 (95% CI [1.1-4.0], p = 0.038). The  proportion of virus shedding in favipiravir group was higher than control group  (80.6% [29/36] vs. 52.6% [10/19], p = 0.030, respectively). C-reactive protein  decreased significantly after treatment in the favipiravir group (p = 0.016). The  adverse events were generally mild and self-limiting. CONCLUSION: Favipiravir was  safe and superior to control in shortening the duration of viral shedding in  SARS-CoV-2 RNA recurrent positive after discharge. However, a larger scale and  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is required to confirm our  conclusion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 causing coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus that utilizes an enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase for its replication. Favipiravir  (FVP) triphosphate, a purine nucleoside analog, inhibits that enzyme. We have  conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy and safety of the  drug FVP as a treatment for COVID-19. METHODS: Databases like Pubmed, Pubmed  Central, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, preprint sites, and clinicaltirals.gov  were searched. The studies with the standard of care (SOC) and FVP as a treatment  drug were considered as the treatment group and the SOC with other antivirals and  supportive care as the control group. Quantitative synthesis was done using  RevMan 5.4. Clinical improvement, negative conversion of reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), adverse effects, and oxygen  requirements were studied. RESULTS: We identified a total of 1798 studies after  searching the electronic databases. Nine in the qualitative studies and four  studies in the quantitative synthesis met the criteria. There was a significant  clinical improvement in the FVP group on the 14th day compared to the control  group (RR 1.29, 1.08-1.54). Clinical deterioration rates were less likely in the  FVP group though statistically not significant (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.30-1.14) at the  endpoint of study (7-15 days). The meta-analysis showed no significant  differences between the two groups on viral clearance (day 14: RR 1.06, 95% CI  0.84-1.33), non-invasive ventilation or oxygen requirement (OR 0.76, 95% CI  0.42-1.39), and adverse effects (OR 0.69, 0.13-3.57). There are 31 randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) registered in different parts of the world focusing FVP  for COVID-19 treatment. CONCLUSION: There is a significant clinical and  radiological improvement following treatment with FVP in comparison to the  standard of care with no significant differences on viral clearance, oxygen  support requirement and side effect profiles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, COVID-19 has spread to almost every corner of the world. In theory, tocilizumab and favipiravir are considered to be reliable  drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 with elevated IL-6. We aimed to assess the  efficacy and safety of tocilizumab combined with favipiravir in patients with  COVID-19. METHODS: This was a multicenter trial in adults with COVID-19. Patients  were randomly assigned (3:1:1) to a 14-day combination of favipiravir combined  with tocilizumab (combination group), favipiravir, and tocilizumab. The primary  outcome was the cumulative lung lesion remission rate (lung CT examination  indicated absorption of lung inflammation). RESULTS: Between Feb 2 and March 15,  2020, 26 patients were recruited; 14 were randomly assigned to the combination  group, 7 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 5 were assigned to the  tocilizumab group. The cumulative lung lesion remission rate at day 14 was  significantly higher in combination group as compared with favipiravir group  (P = 0.019, HR 2.66 95 % CI [1.08-6.53]). And there was also a significant  difference between tocilizumab and favipivavir (P = 0.034, HR 3.16, 95 % CI  0.62-16.10). In addition, there was no significant difference between the  combination group and the tocilizumab group (P = 0.575, HR 1.28 95 %CI  0.39-4.23). Furthermore, combined therapy can also significantly relieve clinical  symptoms and help blood routine to return to normal. No serious adverse events  were reported. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab combined with or without favipiravir can  effectively improve the pulmonary inflammation of COVID-19 patients and inhibit  the deterioration of the disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of favipiravir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Our protocol was registered on  PROSPERO (CRD42020206305). Fourteen databases were searched until February 8(th),  2021. An update search for new RCTs was done on March 2(nd), 2022. Meta-analysis  was done for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. RESULTS: Overall,  157 studies (24 RCTs, 1 non-RCT, 21 observational studies, 2 case series, and 106  case reports) were included. On hospitalized patients, in comparison to standard  of care, favipiravir showed a higher rate of viral clearance at day 5 (RR = 1.60,  p = 0.02), defervescence at day 3-4 (RR = 1.99, p <0.01), chest radiological  improvement (RR = 1.33, p <0.01), hospital discharge at day 10-11 (RR = 1.19, p  <0.01), and shorter clinical improvement time (MD = -1.18, p = 0.05). Regarding  adverse events, favipiravir groups had higher rates of hyperuricemia (RR = 9.42,  p <0.01), increased alanine aminotransferase (RR = 1.35, p <0.01) but lower rates  of nausea (RR = 0.42, p <0.01) and vomiting (R R= 0.19, p=0.02). There were no  differences regarding mortality (RR=1.19, p=0.32), and increased aspartate  aminotransferase (RR = 1.11, p = 0.25). On nonhospitalized patients, no  significant differences were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Adding favipiravir to the  standard of care provides better outcomes for hospitalized patients with  COVID-19. Pregnant, lactating women, and patients with a history of hyperuricemia  should avoid using favipiravir.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exemplified that rigorous evaluation in large animal models is key for translation from promising in vitro results to successful  clinical implementation. Among the drugs that have been largely tested in  clinical trials but failed so far to bring clear evidence of clinical efficacy is  favipiravir, a nucleoside analogue with large spectrum activity against several  RNA viruses in vitro and in small animal models. Here, we evaluate the antiviral  activity of favipiravir against Zika or SARS-CoV-2 virus in cynomolgus macaques.  In both models, high doses of favipiravir are initiated before infection and  viral kinetics are evaluated during 7 to 15 days after infection. Favipiravir  leads to a statistically significant reduction in plasma Zika viral load compared  to untreated animals. However, favipiravir has no effects on SARS-CoV-2 viral  kinetics, and 4 treated animals have to be euthanized due to rapid clinical  deterioration, suggesting a potential role of favipiravir in disease worsening in  SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. To summarize, favipiravir has an antiviral activity  against Zika virus but not against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the cynomolgus macaque  model. Our results support the clinical evaluation of favipiravir against Zika  virus but they advocate against its use against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of several repurposed drugs to prevent hospitalisation or death in patients aged 65 or more with recent symptomatic  SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and no criteria for hospitalisation. TRIAL  DESIGN: Phase III, multi-arm (5) and multi-stage (MAMS), randomized, open-label  controlled superiority trial. Participants will be randomly allocated 1:1:1:1:1  to the following strategies: Arm 1: Control arm Arms 2 to 5: Experimental  treatment arms Planned interim analyses will be conducted at regular intervals.  Their results will be reviewed by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring  Board. Experimental arms may be terminated for futility, efficacy or toxicity  before the end of the trial. New experimental arms may be added if new evidence  suggests that other treatments should be tested. A feasibility and acceptability  substudy as well as an immunological substudy will be conducted alongside the  trial. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria are: 65-year-old or more; Positive test  for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab; Symptoms onset within 3 days before  diagnosis; No hospitalisation criteria; Signed informed consent; Health  insurance. Exclusion criteria are: Inability to make an informed decision to  participate (e.g.: dementia, guardianship); Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale ≥7;  Long QT syndrome; QTc interval > 500 ms; Heart rate <50/min; Kalaemia >5.5 mmol/L  or <3.5 mmol/L; Ongoing treatment with piperaquine, halofantrine, dasatinib,  nilotinib, hydroxyzine, domperidone, citalopram, escitalopram, potent inhibitors  or inducers of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme, repaglinide, azathioprine,  6-mercaptopurine, theophylline, pyrazinamide, warfarin; Known hypersensitivity to  any of the trial drugs or to chloroquine and other 4-aminoquinolines,  amodiaquine, mefloquine, glafenine, floctafenine, antrafenine, ARB; Hepatic  porphyria; Liver failure (Child-Pugh stage ≥B); Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney  disease (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²); Dialysis; Hypersentivity to lactose; Lactase  deficiency; Abnormalities in galactose metabolism; Malabsorption syndrome;  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; Symptomatic hyperuricemia; Ileus;  Colitis; Enterocolitis; Chronic hepatitis B virus disease. The trial is being  conducted in France in the Bordeaux, Corse, Dijon, Nancy, Paris and Toulouse  areas as well as in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Participants are recruited  either at home, nursing homes, general practices, primary care centres or  hospital outpatient consultations. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The four  experimental treatments planned in protocol version 1.2 (April 8(th), 2020) are:  (1) Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, 2 tablets BID on day 0, 2 tablets QD from day 1 to  9; (2) Imatinib 400 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9; (3) Favipiravir 200 mg, 12  tablets BID on day 0, 6 tablets BID from day 1 to 9; (4) Telmisartan 20 mg, 1  tablet QD from day 0 to 9. The comparator is a complex of vitamins and trace  elements (AZINC Forme et Vitalité®), 1 capsule BID for 10 days, for which there  is no reason to believe that they are active on the virus. In protocol version  1.2 (April 8th, 2020): People in the control arm will receive a combination of  vitamins and trace elements; people in the experimental arms will receive  hydroxychloroquine, or favipiravir, or imatinib, or telmisartan. MAIN OUTCOME:  The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with an incidence of  hospitalisation and/or death between inclusion and day 14 in each arm.  RANDOMISATION: Participants are randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to each arm using  a web-based randomisation tool. Participants not treated with an ARB or ACEI  prior to enrolment are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the four  experimental drugs. Participants already treated with an ARB or ACEI are  randomized to receive the comparator or one of the experimental drugs except  telmisartan (i.e.: hydroxychloroquine, imatinib, or favipiravir). Randomisation  is stratified on ACEI or ARBs treatment at inclusion and on the type of residence  (personal home vs. nursing home). BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label  trial. Participants, caregivers, investigators and statisticians are not blinded  to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 1057  participants will be enrolled if all arms are maintained until the final analysis  and no additional arm is added. Three successive futility interim analyses are  planned, when the number of participants reaches 30, 60 and 102 in the control  arm. Two efficacy analyses (interim n°3 and final) will be performed  successively. TRIAL STATUS: This describes the Version 1.2 (April 8(th), 2020) of  the COVERAGE protocol that was approved by the French regulatory authority and  ethics committee. The trial was opened for enrolment on April 15(th), 2020 in the  Nouvelle Aquitaine region (South-West France). Given the current decline of the  COVID-19 pandemic in France and its unforeseeable dynamic in the coming months,  new trial sites in 5 other French regions and in Luxembourg are currently being  opened. A revised version of the protocol was submitted to the regulatory  authority and ethics committee on June 15(th), 2020. It contains the following  amendments: (i) Inclusion criteria: age ≥65 replaced by age ≥60; time since first  symptoms <3 days replaced by time since first symptoms <5 days; (ii) Withdrawal  of the hydroxychloroquine arm (due to external data); (iii) increase in the  number of trial sites. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on Clinical  Trials.gov on April 22(nd), 2020 (Identifier: NCT04356495): and on EudraCT on  April 10(th), 2020 (Identifier: 2020-001435-27). FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol  is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional  file 1). In the interest of expediting dissemination of this material, the  familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the  key elements of the full protocol. The study protocol has been reported in  accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Clinical  Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (Additional file 2).

AB  - BACKGROUND: In late December 2019 and on 1st January 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) infecting humans was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.  Later cases have also been confirmed worldwide. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses  that are phenotypically and genotypically diverse. Globally, as of 6th April  2020, laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported to the World Health  Organisation (WHO) amounted to 1 211 214, including 67 666 deaths. AIM: In the  current study, we performed a literature review on coronavirus outbreak to  summarise details about the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis and the  management strategies for the disease control. PATHOGENESIS: Coronaviruses are  tremendously precise and mature only in differentiated respiratory epithelial  cells, as seen in both organ cultures as well as human volunteers. This virus  will cause the antiviral T-cell response to be erratic, owing to the T-cell  apoptosis activation, triggering the immune system to collapse. TRANSMISSION: The  understanding of the transmission of COVID-19 risk is incomplete. The  transmission mainly occurs through the respiratory droplets once an infected  person sneezes, like the spread of flu and other respiratory infectious agents.  CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Presentations of COVID-19 includes fever, cough, shortness  of breath, malaise and respiratory distress. TREATMENT: There have been no  approved vaccines available for COVID-19 until today. The Ministry of Science and  Technology in the People's Republic of China declared three potential antiviral  medicines suitable for treating COVID-19. Those three medicines are, namely,  favilavir, chloroquine phosphate and remdesivir. Hydroxychloroquine combined with  azithromycin enhances the reduction of the viral load in COVID-19 patients.  CONCLUSION: The corona virus transmits quicker than its two predecessors the  MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has reduced casualty. The global effects of this  latest pandemic are still unclear. Nevertheless, considering that so far no  vaccine has been available; preventive approaches are the best way to fight  against the virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 are still lacking. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes and plasma concentrations of baloxavir  acid and favipiravir in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Favipiravir and baloxavir  acid were evaluated for their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro  before the trial initiation. We conducted an exploratory trial with 3 arms  involving hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomized  assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio into baloxavir marboxil group, favipiravir group, and  control group. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects with viral  negative by Day 14 and the time from randomization to clinical improvement. Virus  load reduction, blood drug concentration and clinical presentation were also  observed. The trial was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR  2000029544). RESULTS: Baloxavir acid showed antiviral activity in vitro with the  half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) of 5.48 μM comparable to arbidol  and lopinavir, but favipiravir didn't demonstrate significant antiviral activity  up to 100 μM. Thirty patients were enrolled. The percentage of patients who  turned viral negative after 14-day treatment was 70%, 77%, and 100% in the  baloxavir marboxil, favipiravir, and control group respectively, with the medians  of time from randomization to clinical improvement was 14, 14 and 15 days,  respectively. One reason for the lack of virological effect and clinical benefits  may be due to insufficient concentrations of these drugs relative to their  antiviral activities. One of the limitations of this study is the time from  symptom onset to randomization, especially in the baloxavir marboxil and control  groups, which is higher than the favipiravir group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings  could not prove a benefit of addition of either baloxavir marboxil or favipiravir  under the trial dosages to the existing standard treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Favipiravir and Molnupiravir, orally available antivirals, have been reported to exert antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. First efficacy data have  been recently reported in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We here report on the  combined antiviral effect of both drugs in a SARS-CoV-2 Syrian hamster infection  model. The infected hamsters were treated twice daily with the vehicle (the  control group) or a suboptimal dose of each compound or a combination of both  compounds. FINDINGS: When animals were treated with a combination of suboptimal  doses of Molnupiravir and Favipiravir at the time of infection, a marked combined  potency at endpoint is observed. Infectious virus titers in the lungs of animals  treated with the combination are reduced by ∼5 log10 and infectious virus are no  longer detected in the lungs of >60% of treated animals. When start of treatment  was delayed with one day a reduction of titers in the lungs of 2.4 log10 was  achieved. Moreover, treatment of infected animals nearly completely prevented  transmission to co-housed untreated sentinels. Both drugs result in an increased  mutation frequency of the remaining viral RNA recovered from the lungs of treated  animals. In the combo-treated hamsters, an increased frequency of C-to-T  mutations in the viral RNA is observed as compared to the single treatment groups  which may explain the pronounced antiviral potency of the combination.  INTERPRETATION: Our findings may lay the basis for the design of clinical studies  to test the efficacy of the combination of Molnupiravir/Favipiravir in the  treatment of COVID-19. FUNDING: stated in the acknowledgment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antiviral medications are being given empirically to some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To support the development of a  COVID-19 management guideline, we conducted a systematic review that addressed  the benefits and harms of 7 antiviral treatments for COVID-19. METHODS: We  searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  (CENTRAL), PubMed and 3 Chinese databases (CNKI, WANFANG and SinoMed) through  Apr. 19, medRxiv and Chinaxiv through Apr. 27, and Chongqing VIP through Apr. 30,  2020. We included studies of ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine,  umifenovir (arbidol), favipravir, interferon and lopinavir/ritonavir. If direct  evidence from COVID-19 studies was not available, we included indirect evidence  from studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East  respiratory syndrome (MERS) for efficacy outcomes and other acute respiratory  viral infections for safety outcomes. RESULTS: In patients with nonsevere  COVID-19 illness, the death rate was extremely low, precluding an important  effect on mortality. We found only very low-quality evidence with little or no  suggestion of benefit for most treatments and outcomes in both nonsevere and  severe COVID-19. An exception was treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, for which  we found low-quality evidence for a decrease in length of stay in the intensive  care unit (risk difference 5 d shorter, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 9 d)  and hospital stay (risk difference 1 d shorter, 95% CI 0 to 2 d). For safety  outcomes, evidence was of low or very low quality, with the exception of  treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir for which moderate-quality evidence suggested  likely increases in diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. INTERPRETATION: To date,  persuasive evidence of important benefit in COVID-19 does not exist for any  antiviral treatments, although for each treatment evidence has not excluded  important benefit. Additional randomized controlled trials involving patients  with COVID-19 will be needed before such treatments can be administered with  confidence.

AB  - In light of the recent pandemic, favipiravir (Avigan(®)), a purine nucleic acid analog and antiviral agent approved for use in influenza in Japan, is being  studied for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Increase in  blood uric acid level is a frequent side effect of favipiravir. Here, we  discussed the mechanism of blood uric acid elevation during favipiravir  treatment. Favipiravir is metabolized to an inactive metabolite M1 by aldehyde  oxidase and xanthine oxidase, and excreted into urine. In the kidney, uric acid  handling is regulated by the balance of reabsorption and tubular secretion in the  proximal tubules. Favipiravir and M1 act as moderate inhibitors of organic anion  transporter 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3), which are involved in uric acid excretion in  the kidney. In addition, M1 enhances uric acid reuptake via urate transporter 1  (URAT1) in the renal proximal tubules. Thus, favipiravir is thought to decrease  uric acid excretion into urine, resulting in elevation of uric acid levels in  blood. Elevated uric acid levels were returned to normal after discontinuation of  favipiravir, and favipiravir is not used for long periods of time for the  treatment of viral infection. Thus, the effect on blood uric acid levels was  subclinical in most studies. Nevertheless, the adverse effect of favipiravir  might be clinically important in patients with a history of gout, hyperuricemia,  kidney function impairment (in which blood concentration of M1 increases), and  where there is concomitant use of other drugs affecting blood uric acid  elevation.

AB  - The virus severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently affecting more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. It has  been declared as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) and the whole world  is suffering from corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, no treatment  for SARS-CoV-2 are approved because of lack of evidence, but a number of clinical  trials are in process and we are expecting fruitful results very soon. This  review focuses on various approaches of treatment and few of the most recent  clinical trials carried out in this field.

AB  - Effective treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed to control this current pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Replication of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the viral  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the likely target of the  investigational nucleotide analogue remdesivir (RDV). RDV shows broad-spectrum  antiviral activity against RNA viruses, and previous studies with RdRps from  Ebola virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have  revealed that delayed chain termination is RDV's plausible mechanism of action.  Here, we expressed and purified active SARS-CoV-2 RdRp composed of the  nonstructural proteins nsp8 and nsp12. Enzyme kinetics indicated that this RdRp  efficiently incorporates the active triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) into RNA.  Incorporation of RDV-TP at position i caused termination of RNA synthesis at  position i+3. We obtained almost identical results with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and  SARS-CoV-2 RdRps. A unique property of RDV-TP is its high selectivity over  incorporation of its natural nucleotide counterpart ATP. In this regard, the  triphosphate forms of 2'-C-methylated compounds, including sofosbuvir, approved  for the management of hepatitis C virus infection, and the broad-acting  antivirals favipiravir and ribavirin, exhibited significant deficits.  Furthermore, we provide evidence for the target specificity of RDV, as RDV-TP was  less efficiently incorporated by the distantly related Lassa virus RdRp, and  termination of RNA synthesis was not observed. These results collectively provide  a unifying, refined mechanism of RDV-mediated RNA synthesis inhibition in  coronaviruses and define this nucleotide analogue as a direct-acting antiviral.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early experience with favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 is promising, but no clinical data have been published in medical journals. This  study aimed to review the experience with favipiravir treatment for COVID-19  pneumonia and to examine whether there are any predictors of treatment response.  METHODOLOGY: Fifty-six patients with severe or progressive pneumonia associated  with COVID-19 who were treated with favipiravir monotherapy for at least five  days were included in this retrospective study. Treatment response was defined as  clinical recovery without any need for admission into the intensive care unit  and/or anti-cytokine therapy. The demographic, clinical, laboratory and  radiographic features of the patients were compared between  favipiravir-responders and non-responders. RESULTS: Of the 56 patients, 34  patients (60.7%) responded to treatment and recovered. There was no difference in  the demographic, clinical, and radiographic findings between the responders and  non-responders. The inflammatory biomarkers were also similar except for the CRP  levels on the day favipiravir was started [74 (36-111) vs. 118.5 (46.5-203) mg/L,  respectively, p = 0.043]. There was also a significant difference in the median  time to defervescence [1 (1-2) vs. 3.5 (1.75-9.25) days, respectively]. Of  clinical interest, 27 (79.4%) and 31 (91.2%) of the responders became afebrile  within two and four days, respectively. The response rate was lower in patients  who presented severe pneumonia associated with respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS:  Patients with non-severe pneumonia at admission and whose fever resolved within  two days of treatment are more likely to improve with favipiravir.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread around the world causing global public health emergency. In the last twenty years, we have witnessed  several viral epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  (SARS-CoV), Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and most recently Middle East  respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). There were tremendous efforts  endeavoured globally by scientists to combat these viral diseases and now for  SARS-CoV-2. Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir  and dexamethasone are adopted for use against COVID-19 and currently clinical  studies are underway to test their safety and efficacy for treating COVID-19  patients. As per World Health Organization reports, so far more than 16 million  people are affected by COVID-19 with a recovery of close to 10 million and deaths  at 600,000 globally. SARS-CoV-2 infection is reported to cause extensive  pulmonary damages in affected people. Given the large number of recoveries, it is  important to follow-up the recovered patients for apparent lung function  abnormalities. In this review, we discuss our understanding about the development  of long-term pulmonary abnormalities such as lung fibrosis observed in patients  recovered from coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and probable  epigenetic therapeutic strategy to prevent the development of similar pulmonary  abnormalities in SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients. In this regard, we address the  use of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved histone deacetylase  (HDAC) inhibitors therapy to manage pulmonary fibrosis and their underlying  molecular mechanisms in managing the pathologic processes in COVID-19 recovered  patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a setting with a limited capacity for hospitalization, "hospitels" have been developed by using hotels as extension healthcare facilities for  patients with mild illness. This study examined the clinical evidence of patients  with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who were treated with favipiravir, the  main medication for treating COVID-19, in the hospitel setting in Thailand.  METHODS: We retrospectively collected demographic and clinical information,  medication treatment, and outcome data for all patients who received favipiravir  for COVID-19 during admission to a hospitel from April 27, 2021, to July 2, 2021.  Risk factors for adults who could not complete treatment in a hospitel and who  required hospitel transfer were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 421 patients were  included in the study. Most patients (94.5%) received favipiravir to treat  COVID-19 pneumonia. Adjunctive corticosteroids were prescribed to 42.3% of  patients. Concerning the treatment outcome, 83.6% of patients completed treatment  at a hospitel, and only two deaths occurred. No serious adverse drug reactions  were observed. On multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.06; 95%  confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.10, P=0.002), dyspnea (OR = 2.84; 95%  CI = 1.25-6.44, P=0.013), loss of taste (OR = 107.63; 95% CI = 1.24-9337.39,  P=0.040), corticosteroid use (OR = 12.56; 95% CI = 3.65-43.18, P < 0.001), and an  extended duration of favipiravir use (OR = 16.91; 95% CI = 7.29-39.24, P < 0.001)  were associated with a higher risk of hospitel transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Low rates  of hospitel transfer and mortality were observed in mild-to-moderate COVID-19  patients treated with favipiravir at hospitel. Caution might be required in  elderly patients, patients with dyspnea or a loss of taste, and patients  receiving a 10-day course of favipiravir or adjunctive corticosteroids because  these patients might require further management in the hospitel.

AB  - The sudden outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, which rapidly grew into a global pandemic, marked the third  introduction of a virulent coronavirus into the human society, affecting not only  the healthcare system, but also the global economy. Although our understanding of  coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective  approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this  article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features,  and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current  epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize  several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle  East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of  disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been  rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on  SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are  currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough  testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing  therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies  happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the  emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their  safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can  directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy  approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate  damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical  studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs,  including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the  viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that  interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current  pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design  approaches based on big data analysis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The pandemic of SARS CoV-2 has required urgent medical treatments for numerous patients. As no specific antiviral agents were available, different  off-the-shelf alternatives have been explored. OBJECTIVE: Here, we review the  rationale behind the use of Favipiravir, and report of the specific studies  supporting this treatment being conducted. METHODS: Here we analyze the relevant  literature to conclude about the present opportunities offered by this  therapeutic agent. RESULTS: This antiviral drug approved influenza in Japan since  2014, has a demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS CoV-2 and is being  investigated in several trials for SARS CoV-2. Signals of benefit were shown in a  small trial for SARS CoV-2. However, in another small study, there was no  advantage. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies, statistically more significant, are  urgently needed to understand the best opportunities offered by this treatment.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) aka SARS-CoV spread over southern China for the first time in 2002-2003 and history repeated again since last year and  took away lives of more than two million people so far. On March 11, 2020  COVID-19 outbreak was officially declared as pandemic by World Health  Organization (WHO). The entire world united to fight back against this ultimate  destruction. Around 90 vaccines are featured against SARS-CoV-2 and more than 300  active clinical trials are underway by several groups and individuals. So far, no  drugs have been currently approved that can completely eliminate the deadly  coronavirus. The promising SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs are favipiravir,  remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and avifavir. In this review, we have discussed  the synthetic approaches elaborately made so far by different groups and chemical  companies all around the world towards top three convincing anti-viral drugs  against SARS-CoV-2, which are favipiravir, remdesivir and lopinavir.

T2  - PloS one
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Post-COVID symptoms are the new concern in the COVID-19 pandemic, where recovered patients experience residual symptoms affecting their quality of  life. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the role of complete vaccination,  prescribed medication, and micronutrients during COVID episodes in the occurrence  of post-COVID symptoms. METHOD: A longitudinal evaluation of Indonesia's  recovered COVID-19 patients was performed using the data collected from July 2021  and extracted in mid-February 2022. All participants were confirmed with a  Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PCR) and/or antigen test. This study  collected demography and comorbidities information, symptoms and treatment of  COVID-19, and collection of self-reported post-COVID symptoms every 30 days  within 90 days after diagnosis/onset. Exposures of interest include vaccination  status, Favipiravir administration, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Zinc. A Generalized  Estimating Equation (GEE) was used to evaluate the longitudinal effect of  exposures, presented with adjusted odds ratios and its 95% confidence interval.  RESULTS: A total of 923 participants (18.2% fully-vaccinated) were involved in  the study, with 79.7% being non-hospitalized. Only 25.7% did not develop any  residual symptoms within 90 days. Fatigue was the most reported post-COVID  symptom in each measurement time (39.5%, 16.3%, and 7.3%). Full-vaccination was  effective against chronic cough (aOR 0.527, 95% CI 0.286-0.971), chronic headache  (aOR 0.317, 95% CI 0.163-0.616), and chronic arthritis (aOR 0.285, 95% CI  0.116-0.703). The combination of micronutrient supplementations and Favipiravir  gave no significant effect on all post-COVID symptoms. However, early initiation  of Favipiravir and delaying vitamin D administration were associated with  arthritis. CONCLUSION: Full vaccination of COVID-19 prevents the disease and the  development of residual symptoms when infected with SARS-COV-2. Hence, it is  crucial to reconsider the prescription of micronutrient supplementation or adjust  the dose of Favipiravir in the current guideline.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and potentially lethal pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No specific antiviral treatment is currently  available. The purpose of this review is to highlight the main repurposed drug  treatments with in-vitro or in-vivo efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2. RECENT  FINDINGS: Recent clinical trials suggested remdesivir, IFN-β-1b and favipiravir  have potential clinical and/or virological benefits on patients with COVID-19.  Short course of stress dose of corticosteroids might be used as adjunctive  treatment to patients who are late presenters with cytokine storm. Convalescent  plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients with high neutralizing antibody might  also be beneficial in the treatment of severe disease. SUMMARY: Early effective  antiviral therapy in COVID-19 patients will suppress the SARS-CoV-2 viral load.  Adjunctive therapy with corticosteroid and convalescent plasma might further  ameliorate the cytokine response. Further randomized clinical trials of  combination therapy are needed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, the capital of Central China's Hubei Province and  has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World  Health Organization since January 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive  search using the PubMed database was carried out to summarize the latest  published information about the epidemiology, definition, pathogenesis, clinical  characteristics, treatment options, prognosis and prevention of coronavirus  disease 2019. DISCUSSION: This new strain of coronavirus, named severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, enters human cells that  express angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptors, which exist in the  respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts and heart,  causing coronavirus disease. Transmission occurs essentially through the  respiratory tract and the main symptoms are fever, cough and dyspnea. Diagnosis  is based on epidemiological, clinical and imaging features and confirmed by  nucleic acid testing. CONCLUSION: Despite intensive research, the exact origin of  the virus and pathophysiology of coronavirus disease is not yet completely known,  and clinically approved vaccines and drugs that target severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 are lacking.

AB  - COVID-19 is a contagious multisystem inflammatory disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied the efficacy of  Aprotinin (nonspecific serine proteases inhibitor) in combination with  Avifavir(®) or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) drugs, which are recommended by the  Russian Ministry of Health for the treatment therapy of moderate COVID-19  patients. This prospective single-center study included participants with  moderate COVID-19-related pneumonia, laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and  admitted to the hospitals. Patients received combinations of intravenous (IV)  Aprotinin (1,000,000 KIU daily, 3 days) and HCQ (cohort 1), inhalation (inh)  treatment with Aprotinin (625 KIU four times per day, 5 days) and HCQ (cohort 2)  or IV Aprotinin (1,000,000 KIU daily for 5 days) and Avifavir (cohort 3). In  cohorts 1-3, the combination therapy showed 100% efficacy in preventing the  transfer of patients (n = 30) to the intensive care unit (ICU). The effect of the  combination therapy in cohort 3 was the most prominent, and the median time to  SARS-CoV-2 elimination was 3.5 days (IQR 3.0-4.0), normalization of the CRP  concentration was 3.5 days (IQR 3-5), of the D-dimer concentration was 5 days  (IQR 4 to 5); body temperature was 1 day (IQR 1-3), improvement in clinical  status or discharge from the hospital was 5 days (IQR 5-5), and improvement in  lung lesions of patients on 14 day was 100%.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus. It is characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2). It has quickly influenced all over the world since it spreads  easily. Common symptoms are fever, cough, difficulty in breathing and muscle  aches. Despite the urgent need to find an effective antiviral treatment, already  available agents are being used alone or in combination all over the world. At  the beginning of the pandemic, death rates of infection caused by COVID-19 are  high but "is COVID-19 responsible for all deaths?", or "are there any  contributions of the frequently used drugs in this period to these deaths?"  Surely herd immunity plays a major role and has contributed to the decline in  mortality rates. Meanwhile, it is kept in mind that due to safety concerns,  changes have also been made in the dosage and combined use of frequently used  drugs. OBJECTIVE: In this review, answers to two questions above and the safety  of treatments, toxicities of agents involving chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine,  remdesivir, favipiravir, lopiravir/ritonavir, sarilumab, tocilizumab, siltuximab,  corticosteroids and bromhexine which are the most frequently used in Turkey and  all over the world will be summarized. CONCLUSION: Among these drugs, favipiravir  seems the most promising drug due to more tolerable adverse effects. More  clinical trials with large sample sizes are needed to find the most effective and  safe drug for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - The outbreak of novel coronavirus (nCoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has posed an  international public health emergency worldwide and forced people to be confined  in their homes. This virus is of high-risk category and is declared a pandemic by  the World Health Organization (WHO). The worldwide researchers and various health  professionals are working together to determine the best way to stop its spread  or halt this virus's spread and circumvent this pandemic condition threatening  millions of human lives. The absence of definitive treatment is possible to  explore to reduce virus infection and enhance patient recovery. Along with  off-label medicines, plasma therapy, vaccines, the researchers exploit the  various plants/herbs and their constituents to effectively treat nCoV infection.  The present study aimed to present brief and most informative salient features of  the numerous facts regarding the SARS-CoV-2, including the structure, genomic  sequence, recent mutation, targeting possibility, and various hurdles in research  progress, and off-labeled drugs, convalescent plasma therapy, vaccine and  plants/herbs for the treatment of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Results  showed that off-labeled drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone,  tocilizumab, antiviral drug (remdesivir, favipiravir), etc., give positive  results and approved for use or approved for restricted use in some countries  like India. Future research should focus on these possibilities that may allow  the development of an effective treatment for COVID-19.

T2  - Expert review of anti-infective therapy
AB  - Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has developed since  December 2019. It has caused a global pandemic with more than three hundred  thousand case fatalities. However, apart from supportive care by respirators, no  standard medical therapy is validated. Areas covered: This paper presents old  drugs with potential in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. The in vitro database,  adverse effects, and potential toxicities of these drugs are reviewed regarding  their feasibility of clinical prescription for the treatment of patients with  COVID-19. To obtain convincing recommendations, we referred to opinions from the  US National Institute of Health regarding drugs repurposed for COVID-19 therapy.  Expert opinion: Although strong evidence of well-designed randomized controlled  studies regarding COVID-19 therapy is presently lacking, remdesivir, teicoplanin,  hydroxychloroquine (not in combination with azithromycin), and ivermectin might  be effective antiviral drugs and are deemed promising candidates for controlling  SARS-CoV-2. In addition, tocilizumab might be considered as the supplementary  treatment for COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome. In future,  clinical trials regarding a combination of potentially effective drugs against  SARS-CoV-2 need to be conducted to establish the optimal regimen for the  treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents an unmet clinical need, due to a high mortality rate, rapid mutation rate in the virus, increased chances of  reinfection, lack of effectiveness of repurposed drugs and economic damage.  COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for effective molecules. Clinically  proven efficacy and safety profiles have made favipiravir (FVP) and remdesivir  (RDV) promising therapeutic options for use against severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Even though both are prodrug  molecules with an antiviral role based on a similar mechanism of action,  differences in pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and pharmacotoxicological  mechanisms have been identified. The present study aims to provide a  comprehensive comparative assessment of FVP and RDV against SARS-CoV-2  infections, by centralizing medical data provided by significant literature and  authorized clinical trials, focusing on the importance of a better understanding  of the interactions between drug molecules and infectious agents in order to  improve the global management of COVID-19 patients and to reduce the risk of  antiviral resistance.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the most infectious diseases which has been caused by coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19). It  has widely spread worldwide and infected more than 28 million people in 215  countries, and more than 920,000 have now died from COVID-19. To date, no  effective antiviral drugs or specific vaccines have been discovered yet.  Considering this situation, the potential therapeutic antiviral drug targets for  the COVID-19 are being repurposed to speed up the discovery of effective  treatment. The most potential drug targets that are continuously being  recommended include Favipiravir, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, and Remdesivir.  Moreover, the antiviral target proteins and anti-host target proteins are being  reported continuously. This review has summarized the current research studies on  potential therapeutic drug targets that are being tested against the SARS-CoV-2.  It will provide information related to potential repurposing drugs for overcoming  COVID-19.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of a new form of pneumonia. It was subsequently named COVID-19  and reported as the source of a respiratory disease occurrence starting in  December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It has been affirmed a public  health emergency of international significance by the World Health Organization.  It is regarded as a subset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and  the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); COVID-19 is triggered by a  betacoronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, which affects the lower respiratory tract and  occurs in humans as pneumonia. A variety of drugs, such as remdesivir and  favipiravir, are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate for the  management of COVID-19. The effect of the pandemic as well as the epidemic that  follows through the life cycles of various recycled plastic is evaluated,  particularly those required for personal safety and health care. In response to  the growth in COVID-19 cases worldwide, the energy and environmental impacts of  these lifecycle management have risen rapidly. However, significant hazardous  waste management concerns arise due to the need to assure the elimination of  residual pathogens in household and medical wastes. This review article  summarizes the preventive and environmental management of COVID-19.

AB  - A cluster of pneumonia (COVID-19) cases have been found in Wuhan China in late December, 2019, and subsequently, a novel coronavirus with a positive stranded  RNA was identified to be the aetiological virus (severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2), which has a phylogenetic similarity to  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV-2 transmits  mainly through droplets and close contact and the elder or people with chronic  diseases are high-risk population. People affected by SARS-CoV-2 can be  asymptomatic, which brings about more difficulties to control the transmission.  COVID-19 has become pandemic rapidly after onset, and so far the infected people  have been above 2 000 000 and more than 130 000 died worldwide according to  COVID-19 situation dashboard of World Health Organization  (https://covid19.who.int). Here, we summarized the current known knowledge  regarding epidemiological, pathogenesis, pathology, clinical features,  comorbidities and treatment of COVID-19/ SARS-CoV-2 as reference for the  prevention and control COVID-19.

AB  - Favipiravir is a potential antiviral drug undergoing clinical trials to manage various viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 (SARS-CoV-2). Favipiravir possesses antiviral properties against RNA viruses,  including SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, these viruses do not have authorized  antiviral drugs for the management of diseases resulting from their infection,  hence the dire need to accentuate the discovery of antiviral drugs that are  efficacious and have a broad spectrum. Favipiravir acts primarily by blocking  inward and outward movements of the virus from cells. Favipiravir is a prodrug  undergoing intracellular phosphorylation and ribosylation to form an active form,  favipiravir-RTP, which binds viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).  Considering the novel mechanism of favipiravir action, especially in managing  viral infections, it is vital to pay more attention to the promised favipiravir  hold in the management of SARS-CoV-2, its efficacy, and dosage regimen, and  interactions with other drugs. In conclusion, favipiravir possesses antiviral  properties against RNA viruses, including COVID- 19. Favipiravir is effective  against SARS-CoV-2 infection through inhibition of RdRp. Pre-clinical and  large-scalp prospective studies are recommended for efficacy and long-term safety  of favipiravir in COVID-19.

AB  - The unprecedented challenge faced by mankind due to emergence of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has obligated researchers across the globe to develop  effective medicine for prevention and treatment of this deadly infection. The aim  of this review is to compile recently published research articles on anti-COVID  19 management with their benefits and risk to facilitate decision making of the  practitioners and policy makers. Unfortunately, clinical outcomes reported for  antivirals are not consistent. Initial favorable reports on lopinavir/ritonavir  contradicted by recent studies. Ostalmovir has conflicting reports. Short term  therapy of remdesivir claimed to be beneficial. Favipiravir demonstrated good  recovery in some of the cases of COVID-19. Umifenovir (Arbidol) was associated  with reduction in mortality in few studies. Overall, until now, U.S. Food and  Drug administration issued only emergency use authorization to remdesivir for the  treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children  hospitalized with severe disease.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected more than seven million individuals in 213 countries worldwide with a basic reproduction number ranging  from 1.5 to 3.5 and an estimated case fatality rate ranging from 2% to 7%. A  substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic; however,  symptomatic cases might present with fever, cough, and dyspnoea or severe  symptoms up to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently, RNA RT-PCR is the  screening tool, while bilateral chest CT is the confirmatory clinical diagnostic  test. Several drugs have been repurposed to treat COVID-19, including chloroquine  or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir  combination, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, and EIDD-1931. Recently,  Remdesivir gained FDA emergency approval based on promising early findings from  the interim analysis of 1063 patients. The recently developed serology testing  for SARSCoV-2 antibodies opened the door to evaluate the actual burden of the  disease and to determine the rate of the population who have been previously  infected (or developed immunity). This review article summarizes current data on  the COVID-19 pandemic starting from the early outbreak, viral structure and  origin, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, discharge criteria, and future  research.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus responsible for the current global pandemic, which first emerged in  December 2019. This coronavirus has affected 217 countries worldwide, most of  which have enacted non-remedial preventive measures, such as nationwide  lockdowns, work from home, travel bans, and social isolation. Pharmacists,  doctors, nurses, technologists, and other healthcare professionals have played  pivotal roles during this pandemic. Unfortunately, confirmed drugs have not been  identified for the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  caused by SARSCoV2; however, favipiravir and remdesivir have been reported as  promising antiviral drugs. Some vaccines have already been developed, and  vaccination is ongoing globally. Various nanotechnologies are currently being  developed in many countries for preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread and treating  COVID-19 infections. In this article, we present an overview of the COVID-19  pandemic situation and discuss nanotechnology-based approaches and  investigational therapeutics for COVID-19.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city of China in late December 2019 and identified as a novel coronavirus. Due to  its contagious nature, the virus spreads rapidly and causes coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19). The global tally of COVID-19 was 28 million in early September  2020. The fears and stress associated with SARS-CoV-2 has demolished the  socio-economic status worldwide. Researchers are trying to identify treatments,  especially antiviral drugs and/or vaccines, that could potentially control the  viral spread and manage the ongoing unprecedented global crisis. To date, more  than 300 clinical trials have been conducted on various antiviral drugs, and  immunomodulators are being evaluated at various stages of COVID-19. This review  aims to collect and summarize a list of drugs used to treat COVID-19, including  dexamethasone, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir,  remdesivir, tociluzimab, nitazoxanide and ivermectin. However, some of these  drugs are not effective and their use has been suspended by WHO.

AB  - COVID-19, a dreaded and highly contagious pandemic, is flagrantly known for its rapid prevalence across the world. Till date, none of the treatments are  distinctly accessible for this life-threatening disease. Under the prevailing  conditions of a medical emergency, one creative strategy for the identification  of novel and potential antiviral agents gaining momentum in research institutions  and progressively being leveraged by pharmaceutical companies is target-based  drug repositioning/repurposing. Continuous monitoring and recording of results  offer anticipation that this strategy may help to reveal new medications for  viral infections. This review recapitulates the neoteric illation of COVID-19,  its genomic dispensation, molecular evolution via phylogenetic assessment, drug  targets, the most frequently worldwide used repurposed drugs and their  therapeutic applications, and a recent update on vaccine management strategies.  The available data from solidarity trials exposed that the treatment with several  known drugs, viz. lopinavir-ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, etc. had  displayed various antagonistic effects along with no impactful result in the  diminution of mortality rate. The drugs, like remdesivir, favipiravir, and  ribavirin, have proved to be quite safer therapeutic options for treatment  against COVID-19. Similarly, dexamethasone, convalescent plasma therapy and oral  administration of 2DG are expected to reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19  patients.

No effective approaches are found as yet for the therapy  and epidemiological control of this new virus. We searched the literature in  PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and MeSH, for articles and  abstracts describing SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, pneumonia, clinical trials, drug,  treatment, and medicine.Areas covered: The present study aimed to comprehensively  overview the current literature on effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.Expert  opinion: Since the beginning of this pandemic disease, many studies have been  conducted to find effective drugs to prevent COVID-19, because there are no  specific drugs for the treatment of this disease. Most of these drugs with the  antiviral potential effect toward COVID-19 are already used as the treatment of  other infectious diseases. Some drugs that show the promising therapeutic  potential in the initial clinical studies include remdesivir as an inhibitor of  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and favipiravir as an inhibitor of virus  replication. Currently, remdesivir received the FDA authorizes to use as an  experimental drug for emergency use in COVID-19 patients.

Based on early experience, different treatment such as anti-viral  drugs (remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir), corticosteroids  (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone) or convalescent plasma therapy are  recommended in addition to supportive care and symptomatic therapy. There are  several treatments currently being investigated to address the pathological  conditions associated with COVID-19. This review provides currently available  information and insight into pathophysiology of the disease, potential targets,  and relevant clinical trials for COVID-19.

AB  - The novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has quickly spread across the world and pose serious threat to public health because it can infect people very easily. The  major clinical symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection include fever, dry cough, myalgia,  fatigue, and diarrhea. The 2019-nCoV belongs to the betacoronavirus family, and  gene sequencing results demonstrate that it is a single-stranded RNA virus,  closely related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle  East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). It has been observed that the virus  invades human body mainly through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  (ACE2) receptors similar to SARS-CoV and the main protease (Mpro) acts as a  critical protease for digesting the polyprotein into functional polypeptides  during the replication and transcription process of 2019-nCoV. In this review, we  summarized the real-time information of 2019-nCoV treatment methods and mainly  focused on the chemical drugs including lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir and other potential  innovative active molecules. Their potential targets, activity, clinical status  and side effects are described. In addition, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM),  Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) and biological reagents available, as well as  the promising vaccine candidates against 2019-nCoV are also discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Corona virus disease is caused by the enveloped, single stranded RNA virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  becoming the deadliest disease of the century. Its global outbreak has led  researchers to develop drugs or vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease.  Favipiravir is an approved orally administered antiviral drug that selectively  inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, used off-label to treat COVID-19.  Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of  this drug for severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This was an observational  retrospective study, carried out at the ICU of King Saud Medical City (KSMC) from  June 2020 to August 2020. Including a total of one thousand six hundred and  ninety-nine patients (n=1699). Categorized into a treatment group (193 patients)  who received Favipiravir along with standard care, and non-treatment group (1506  patients) who received standard care only. RESULTS: ICU all-cause mortality was  similar in both groups i.e., (Treated group 38.3% Vs Untreated group 39.4%, 95%  CI of difference: -6.6% to +8.4%; p = 0.8). The subgroup analysis of survivors as  compared to deceased in the treatment group showed that survivors had  significantly lower age, international normalising ratio (INR), blood urea  nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine. The mean ICU length of stay (LOS) was shorter for  survivors compared to deceased (11.2± 8.03 Vs 16.7±9.8 days respectively), while  hospital LOS was almost similar between the two groups. Advanced age (OR 1.03  [95% CI: 1.01-1.06]; p=0.004), higher INR and BUN were significantly associated  with increased odds of mortality. Comparison of lab investigations at day 1 and  day 10 in the treatment group (regardless of outcome) showed that there was a  significant increase in Alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALK),  and Bilirubin, while an insignificant trend of increase in Aspartate transaminase  (AST) and creatinine was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, Favipiravir showed  better therapeutic responses in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, in terms  of average duration of stay in the intensive care unit and was well tolerated in  the younger age, but showed no mortality benefit. However, elevated levels of  inflammatory markers, including increased ALT, AST, BUN, bilirubin, and  creatinine, needs to be carefully examined.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to a large family of zoonotic supercapsid viruses, including about 40 species of RNA-containing viruses with several strains capable  of causing damage to the lungs and respiratory tract. The severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was responsible for the worldwide  SARS outbreak in 2003. The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause  of significant health concerns and thousands of deaths in 2019-2020 and outlined  the need for novel antivirals. The present review is devoted to the development  of effective and selective nucleoside drugs for the treatment of coronavirus  infections. To date, about half of antivirals have been created based on  nucleosides. The majority of drugs based on nucleosides have been approved by  FDA. This indicates a fruitful area for the development of novel antivirals based  on nucleosides. The review describes the main features of pathogenic SARS-CoV,  MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 strains, presents their comparison, considers promising  approaches to creating nucleoside drugs for the treatment of coronavirus  infections and provides a systematic evaluation of all the known nucleoside  derivatives, which inhibit the reproduction of coronaviruses in cells. To date,  two known nucleoside drugs (Remdesivir, Favipiravir) have been recommended for  the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and nine hit compounds based on nucleosides  and their analogues have been found, one of which efficiently suppressing  SARS-CoV-2 replication and eight others inhibiting SARS-CoV replication.

AB  - CONTEXT: Drug repurposing is a relevant approach during the COVID-19 pandemic, because development of new drugs is time-consuming and costly, and the safety of  new drugs is paramount. Drug repurposing focuses on researching new indications  for existing drugs and can reduce the challenges faced in drug development.  OBJECTIVE: The current review intended to examine the current status of drugs  being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. DESIGN: The research team performed a  literature review, searching relevant literature databases to find abstracts of  relevant articles in journals published from 2010 until May 16, 2020. The sources  of data included Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. The search terms used  included repositioning of drugs, repurposing of drugs and COVID-19 therapy, and  SARS-CoV-2 therapy. SETTING: The research team conducted this study at the  Department of Pharmacology, Punjab University College of Pharmacy, University of  the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan; Mangalbare Hospital, Morang, Nepal; and Dr Iwamura  Memorial Hospital, Bhaktapur, Nepal. RESULTS: Repurposing of drugs from different  pharmacological groups including antivirals like remdesivir, lopinavir,  ritonavir, arbidol, oseltamivir, penciclovir, favipiravir, ganciclovir, and  ribavirin; other antibiotics like azithromycin, ivermectin, eravacycline,  valrubicin, streptomycin, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, caspofungin, and colistin;  and other agents like hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, tocilizumab, camostat,  nafamostat, carfilzomib, interferon, aprepitant, and dexamethasone can be  considered for COVID-19 therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although current results are  promising, limitations to drug repurposing, such as a low success rate and the  possibility of adverse events, can't be overlooked. With continuous research and  technical advancements, repurposing will no doubt provide a notable scientific  contribution to innovation in drug development and pharmacotherapy practice for  the treatment of new diseases or existing diseases in a new way.

AB  - Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses known to cause illnesses that vary between the common cold and more severe diseases to include severe acute  respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). A novel  coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.  This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in  humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel  coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global  containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise,  with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths  worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19  patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to  quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review,  we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available  medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is  approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat  symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine,  drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the  National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of  COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation  by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for COVID-19. The  first COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to be ready for clinical trials before the  end of the year.

AB  - By December 2019, humanity was challenged by a new infectious respiratory disease named coronavirus disease of 2019 or COVID-19. This is a viral infection based on  the presence of the previously non-problematic coronavirus with assigned number  2. This virus causes severe acute respiratory distress and is known now as  SARS-CoV2. Since SARS-CoV2 is an RNA virus, remdesivir and favipiravir, both  broad-spectrum RNA polymerase inhibitors, were repurposed for treating COVID-19  patients. Remdesivir and favipiravir are antimetabolites, and they are  structurally related to the naturally occurring structural elements of RNA. Both  agents are prodrugs and must be activated intracellularly to exert their effects  through numerous and different mechanisms of action. Efforts have been exerted to  determine their efficacy and safety against COVID-19 through clinical trials.  Clinical trials have shown an association of remdesivir with increased frequency  of adverse effects (in comparison to favipiravir). Nevertheless, the data  obtained with remdesivir resulted in its approval by the FDA on the 22(nd) of  October 2020 for COVID-19 treatment. At present, remdesivir is being recommended  by several treatment guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The  evidence in favor of favipiravir is compromised by the small number and  low-quality of trials conducted. Favipiravir has shown various benefits when  administered in mild and moderate cases of COVID-19, while remdesivir was more  beneficial in more severe cases of the disease. Since the two agents are suitable  for different groups of patients, both drugs can play a significant role in  fighting this pandemic. The goal of this work is to summarize the information  available on two antimetabolites - remdesivir and favipiravir - and to compare  clinical experience obtained so far with these two agents in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - A global outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected millions of people over a short period of time. The communicability and increased mortality from the  SARS-CoV-2 infection mandated the WHO to declare COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic.  The virus outbreak has spread when there are no approved vaccines, treatments, or  prophylactic therapies available. Researchers from all over the world have  prioritised development of vaccines and antivirals. Several vaccine projects have  seen successes in preclinical, phase I, and phase II clinical trials using  recombinant DNA, mRNA, live attenuated virus, S-protein subunits, virus like  particles, and viral vectors. Initial findings from antivirals such as  remdesivir, favipiravir, danoprevir or lopinavir with ritonavir are presented.  Immunomodulatory molecules such as sarilumab, tocilizumab, janus kinase  inhibitors, and hyperimmune convalescent plasma have mixed outcomes from initial  clinical findings; however, pending randomised controlled trials will assist  national health institutions to make treatment recommendations for COVID-19.  Where compassionate use of remdesivir has shown some benefits, therapies such as  hydroxychloroquine have proven harmful due to their toxicities. This review  discusses pharmacological interventions at play and evidence-based successes and  limitations of non-pharmacological therapies such as social distancing, personal  protective equipment, and ventilator support associated with the prevention and  treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has prompted the repurposing of  drugs on the basis of promising in vitro and therapeutic results with other human  coronavirus diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle  East respiratory syndrome (MERS). These repurposed drugs have mainly included  remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin, interferons, and  hydroxychloroquine. Unfortunately, the first open-label, randomized, controlled  trials are showing poor efficacy of these repurposed drugs. These results  highlight the necessity of identifying and characterizing specific and potent  SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.

AB  - Therapeutic options for coronavirus disease 2019 are desperately needed to respond to the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic.  Both antiviral drugs and immunomodulators might have their place in the  management of coronavirus disease 2019. Unfortunately, no drugs have been  approved yet to treat infections with human coronaviruses. As it will take years  to develop new therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the  current focus is on the repurposing of drugs that have been approved or are in  development for other conditions. Several clinical trials have already been  conducted or are currently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of such drugs. Here,  we discuss the potential of these therapies for the treatment of coronavirus  disease 2019.

The infection has now catapulted into a full-blown pandemic across the world,  which has affected more than 2 million people and has led to approximately  150,000 fatalities all over the world (WHO). In this review, we elaborate all  currently available data that shed light on possible methods for treatment of  COVID-19, such as antiviral drugs, corticosteroids, convalescent plasma, and  potentially effective vaccines. Additionally, ongoing and discontinued clinical  trials that have been carried out for validating probable treatments for COVID-19  are discussed. The review also elaborates the prospective approach and the  possible advantages of using convalescent plasma and stem cells for the  improvement of clinical symptoms and meeting the demand for an instantaneous  cure.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak poses a major global threat to the public health worldwide. The infectious disease caused  by the virus that affected the entire world was named as the Coronavirus  disease-2019 (COVID-19). The knowledge regarding the wide clinico-biological  aspects of the COVID-19 continues to evolve very rapidly, given the growing data  from all over the world. During this complicated process, healthcare  professionals have benefited from each other’s experiences in combatting against  the COVID-19 syndrome. COVID-19 related studies have been performed by a wide  variety of research groups in Turkey as well as the rest of the world. The aim of  this paper is to outline Turkish COVID-19 research indexed in the LitCovid  system. LitCovid is a curated literature hub for tracking up-to-date scientific  data about the SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19’s first case was detected in Turkey, on March  11th, 2020. Six months after the first case was observed, the total number of  COVID-19 patients was reported to be as 286,455, and the total number of deaths  due to SARS-CoV-2 was 6895. The genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus showed  significant identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Numerous drugs including  lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, neuraminidase inhibitors, remdesivir,  umifenovir, azithromycin, and chloroquine have been suggested for the management  of COVID-19 although the exact treatment is yet to be determined.

AB  - COVID-19 has grown into a global pandemic that has strained healthcare throughout the world. There is a sense of urgency in finding a cure for this deadly virus.  In this study, we reviewed the empiric options used in common practice for  COVID-19, based on the literature available online, with an emphasis on human  experiences with these treatments on severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated  coronavirus (SARS-COV-1) and other viruses. Convalescent blood products are the  most promising potential treatment for use in COVID-19. The use of chloroquine or  hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, and tocilizumab are some of the other  promising potential therapies; however, they are yet to be tested in randomized  clinical trials (RCTs). The use of lopinavir-ritonavir did not prove beneficial  in a large RCT. The use of corticosteroids should be avoided in COVID-19  pneumonia unless used for other indications, based on the suggestion of harm in  patients with SARS-COV-1 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)  infection. The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material  section.

AB  - An outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by an infection of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred  in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This new virus belongs to the group of  enveloped RNA beta-coronaviruses. Symptoms may differ in various infected  persons, but major presentations include dry cough, nasal congestion, shortness  of breath, fever, and general malaise. The disease appears to be more severe in  patients above the age of 60 years and those with underlying conditions such as  diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory disease, and  hypertension. There is still no approved vaccine against COVID-19, but more than  a hundred are at different stages of development. It is known that the  development of new drugs takes a relatively long time, so several known and  already-approved drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of this disease. In  this review, we explore the therapeutic and vaccine options that are available  for COVID-19 6 months after its outbreak. Most noteworthy among the therapeutic  options are dexamethasone, remdesivir, Avigan (favipiravir) and convalescent  plasma.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic is highly contagious and has spread rapidly across the globe. To date there have been no specific treatment options available for this  life-threatening disease. During this medical emergency, target-based drug  repositioning/repurposing with a continuous monitoring and recording of results  is an effective method for the treatment and drug discovery. This review  summarizes the recent findings on COVID-19, its genomic organization, molecular  evolution through phylogenetic analysis and has recapitulated the drug targets by  analyzing the viral molecular machinery as drug targets and repurposing of most  frequently used drugs worldwide and their therapeutic applications in COVID-19.  Data from solidarity trials have shown that the treatment with Chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir had no effect in reducing the  mortality rate and also had adverse side effects. Remdesivir, Favipiravir and  Ribavirin might be a safer therapeutic option for COVID-19. Recent clinical trial  has revealed that dexamethasone and convalescent plasma treatment can reduce  mortality in patients with severe forms of COVID-19.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a causal factor of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Drug repurposing, portraying patented  drugs as a successful drug development technique, could shorten the period and  minimize costs relative to de novo drug exploration. Recently several drugs have  been used as anti-SARS-CoV-2 such as Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine,  Azithromycin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Nafamostat mesylate and so on. Despite such  efforts, there is currently no successful broad-spectrum antiviral  countermeasures to combat SARS-CoV-2 or possibly potential CoVs pandemic.  Therefore it is desperately important to recognize and test widely efficient,  reliable anti-CoV therapies now and in the future. Remdesivir and Favipiravir  were more promising despite having side effects; it had prominent efficacy and  efficiency while still not yet approved as the official anti-viral drug for SARS  CoV-2. In this review, we summarizes the current drug and vaccine discovery  status against SARS-CoV-2, predicting that these efforts will help create  effective drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - COVID-19 is a clinical outcome of viral infection emerged due to strain of beta coronavirus which attacks the type-2 pneumocytes in alveoli via  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. There is no satisfactory drug  developed against 'SARS-CoV2', highlighting an immediate necessity  chemotherapeutic repurposing plan COVID-19. Drug repurposing is a method of  selection of approved therapeutics for new use and is considered to be the most  effective drug finding strategy since it includes less time and cost to obtain  treatment compared to the de novo drug acquisition process. Several drugs such as  hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, teicoplanin, darunavir, ritonavir, nitazoxanide,  chloroquine, tocilizumab and favipiravir (FPV) showed their activity against  'SARS-CoV2' in vitro. This review has emphasized on repurposing of drugs, and  biologics used in clinical set up for targeting COVID-19 and to evaluate their  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety with their future aspect. The key  benefit of drug repurposing is the wealth of information related to its safety,  and easy accessibility. Altogether repurposing approach allows access to  regulatory approval as well as reducing sophisticated safety studies.

AB  - The need for proven disease-specific treatments for the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 necessitates a worldwide search for therapeutic options.  Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus shares extensive homology with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,  effective therapies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may also have therapeutic potential  for the current COVID-19 outbreak. To identify therapeutics that might be  repositioned for treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19, we strategically  reviewed the literature to identify existing therapeutics with evidence of  efficacy for the treatment of the three coronaviruses that cause severe  respiratory illness (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Mechanistic and in  vitro analyses suggest multiple promising therapeutic options with potential for  repurposing to treat patients with COVID-19. Therapeutics with particularly high  potential efficacy for repurposing include camostat mesylate, remdesivir,  favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, convalescent plasma, and humanized  monoclonal antibodies. Camostat mesylate has shown therapeutic potential, likely  by preventing viral entry into epithelial cells. In early research, the targeted  antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir appear to benefit patients by decreasing  viral replication; clinical trials suggest that remdesivir speeds recovery from  COVID-19. Tocilizumab and baricitinib appear to improve mortality by preventing a  severe cytokine storm. Convalescent plasma and humanized monoclonal antibodies  offer passive immunity and decreased recovery time. This review highlights  potential therapeutic options that may be repurposed to treat COVID-19 and  suggests opportunities for further research.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: At this time, there is no specific therapeutic or vaccine for treatment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).  Hence, available drugs for treatment of other viral infections may be useful to  treat COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: The focus of the current review was studying the  main characteristics of favipiravir and its usefulness to treat COVID-19. An  electronic search was done by using Pubmed and Google scholar. EXPERT OPINION:  Based on the mechanism of action and safety of favipiravir, the drug may be a  promising candidate for compassionate use against the SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Favipiravir has a wide range of activity against many single-stranded RNA  viruses, is well tolerated in humans and has a high barrier to resistance.  However, high doses of the agent are necessary to obtain an efficient antiviral  activity. Favipiravir is teratogen in pregnant women and associated with the  hyperuricemia. Therefore, the administration of the drug should be well  controlled. Investigating the antiviral prophylactic potency of favipiravir and  search for its pro-drugs and/or analogs showing improved activity and/or safety  are critical.

AB  - The emerging pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents an unprecedented  challenge for healthcare systems globally. The clinical course of COVID-19 and  its ability to rapidly create widespread infection has major implications,  warranting vigorous infection prevention and control measures. As the confirmed  number of cases has surpassed 5.6 million worldwide and continues to grow, the  potential severity of the disease and its deadly complications requires urgent  development of novel therapeutic agents to both prevent and treat COVID-19.  Although vaccines and specific drug therapies have yet to be discovered, ongoing  research and clinical trials are being conducted to investigate the efficacy of  repurposed drugs for treating COVID-19. In the present review, the drug  candidates that have been suggested to treat COVID-19 will be discussed. These  include anti-viral agents (remdesivir, ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir,  favipiravir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, oseltamivir, umifenovir),  immunomodulatory agents (tocilizumab, interferons, plasma transfusions), and  adjunctive agents (azithromycin, corticosteroids), among other miscellaneous  agents. The mechanisms of action and further pharmacological properties will be  explored, with a particular focus on the evidence-based safety and efficacy of  each agent.

AB  - The emergence of the global pandemic caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has put a challenge to identify or derive the  therapeutics for its prevention and treatment. Despite the unprecedented advances  in the modern medicinal system, currently, there are no proven effective  therapies. However, rapid research on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology help unveiling some  new targets for potential drug therapies. Many drugs have been screened, and even  their clinical trials are going on at an exceptional pace. Amongst these  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors (favipiravir and remdesivir) and steroids  especially dexamethasone showed promising effects. The biological agents like  tocilizumab, interferons, and convalescent plasma prove to be beneficial in viral  clearance. Moreover, many immunomodulatory and viral S protein targeting vaccines  have their ongoing clinical trials. The establishment of various in vitro and in  vivo models for preclinical studies can additionally help the current research.  The volume and the pace of the clinical trials launched to evaluate the safety  and efficacy of various agents against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  reflect the need for high-quality evidence for various therapies to be practiced  by clinicians. This study aims to sum up all the current advances in the global  medicinal system against the COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant recipients appear to be particularly high risk for critical COVID-19 illness owing to chronic immunosuppression and coexisting  conditions. The aim of this study is to present the clinical characteristics and  outcomes of our hospital's kidney transplant recipients who were hospitalized due  to COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In our retrospective observational study of  COVID-19 PCR-positive patients, 31 of them were hospitalized with COVID-19  pneumonia and they were evaluated using demographics, laboratory data, treatment,  and outcome. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI), which is calculated using  the serum albumin concentration and total lymphocytic count, was also evaluated.  The baseline immunosuppressive therapy of patients at the time of admission and  the treatments they received during their hospitalization were recorded. All  patients were treated with favipiravir. RESULTS: Of the 31 renal transplant  patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 20 were male and the mean age was 52.7 ± 13.4.  Nine (29%) of the patients died. All patients were treated with favipiravir for 5  days; laboratory tests were recorded before and after treatment. The mean PNI of  the patients who survived was higher than the patients who died. CONCLUSIONS: The  9 patients who died had lower PNI and higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio  (NLR), creatinine, l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and C-reactive  protein (CRP) levels. Hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19  have higher rates of mortality. The PNI exhibited good predictive performance and  may be a useful clinical marker that can be used for estimating survival in  COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic hit the world lately and caused acute respiratory syndrome in humans. The causative agent of the disease was soon identified by  scientists as SARS-CoV-2 and later called a novel coronavirus by the general  public. Due to the severity and rapid spread of the disease, WHO classifies the  COVID-19 pandemic as the 6th public health emergency even after taking efforts  like worldwide quarantine and restrictions. Since only symptomatic treatment is  available, the best way to control the spread of the virus is by taking  preventive measures. Various types of antigen/antibody detection kits and  diagnostic methods are available for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In  recent years, various phytochemicals and repurposing drugs showing a broad range  of anti-viral activities with different modes of actions have been identified.  Repurposing drugs such as arbidol, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir,  favipiravir, remdesivir, hexamethylene amiloride, dexamethasone, tocilizumab,  interferon-β, and neutralizing antibodies exhibit in vitro anti-coronaviral  properties by inhibiting multiple processes in the virus life cycle. Various  research groups are involved in drug trials and vaccine development. Plant-based  antiviral compounds such as baicalin, calanolides, curcumin, oxymatrine, matrine,  and resveratrol exhibit different modes of action against a wide range of  positive/negative sense-RNA/DNA virus, and future researches need to be conducted  to ascertain their role and use in managing SARS-CoV-2. Thus this article is an  attempt to review the current understanding of COVID- 19 acute respiratory  disease and summarize its clinical features with their prospective control and  various aspects of the therapeutic approach.

AB  - In December 2019, when the whole world is waiting for Christmas and New Year, the physicians of Wuhan, China, are astounded by clusters of patients suffering from  pneumonia from unknown causes. The pathogen isolated from the respiratory  epithelium of the patients is similar to previously known coronaviruses with some  distinct features. The disease was initially called nCoV-2019 or SARS-nCoV-2 and  later termed as COVID-19 by WHO. The infection is rapidly propagating from the  day of emergence, spread throughout the globe and now became a pandemic which  challenged the competencies of developed nations in terms of health care  management. As per WHO report, 216 countries are affected with SARS-CoV-19 by  August 5, 2020 with 18, 142, 718 confirmed cases and 691,013 deaths reports. Such  huge mortality and morbidity rates are truly threatening and calls for some  aggressive and effective measures to slow down the disease transmission. The  scientists are constantly engaged in finding a potential solution to diagnose and  treat the pandemic. Various FDA approved drugs with the previous history of  antiviral potency are repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. Different drugs and  vaccines are under clinical trials and some rapid and effective diagnostic tools  are also under development. In this review, we have highlighted the current  epidemiology through infographics, disease transmission and progression, clinical  features and diagnosis and possible therapeutic approaches for COVID-19. The  article mainly focused on the development and possible application of various FDA  approved drugs, including chloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, nefamostate  mesylate, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, ribavirin etc., vaccines under development  and various registered clinical trials exploring different therapeutic measures  for the treatment of COVID-19. This information will definitely help the  researchers to understand the in-line scientific progress by various clinical  agencies and regulatory bodies against COVID-19.

AB  - The whole world is battling through coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is a fatal pandemic. In the early 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared  it as a global health emergency without definitive treatments and preventive  approaches. In the absence of definitive therapeutic agents, this thorough review  summarizes and outlines the potency and safety of all molecules and therapeutics  which may have potential antiviral effects. A number of molecules and  therapeutics licensed or being tested for some other conditions were found  effective in different in vitro studies as well as in many small sample-sized  clinical trials and independent case studies. However, in those clinical trials,  there were some limitations which need to be overcome to find the most promising  antiviral against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).  In conclusion, many of above-mentioned antivirals seems to have some therapeutic  effects but none of them have been shown to have a strong evidence for their  proper recommendation and approval in the treatment of COVID-19. Constantly  evolving new evidences, exclusive adult data, language barrier, and type of study  (observational, retrospective, small-sized clinical trials, or independent case  series) resulted to the several limitations of this review. The need for  multicentered, large sample-sized, randomized, placebo-controlled trials on  COVID-19 patients to reach a proper conclusion on the most promising antiviral  agent is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only has a long-term effect on its survivors, it also affects their quality of life, including inducing depression  as a possible manifestation of central nervous system disruption. Favipiravir  shows promising efficacy as an antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19.  However, its effect on the sequelae of COVID-19 has not been explored. Therefore,  this study aims to assess the impact of Favipiravir and address the factors  associated with post-COVID depression in Indonesia. METHOD: This cohort study  conducted a post-COVID-19 survey on Indonesian patients who were diagnosed by  using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antigen tests until  January 2022. An online questionnaire was distributed to obtain information on  demographics, comorbidities, health behavior, symptoms, and treatment. The  propensity technique was used to allocate the participants into the favipiravir  and nonrecipient groups (1:1). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was  used for outcome measurement. The cohort was followed up biweekly for 60 days  after onset/diagnosis to determine the occurrence of depression. Cox regression  analysis with an adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval was used to  estimate the effect of favipiravir on post-COVID-19 depression. RESULTS: The data  included the information of 712 participants, of whom 18.54% had depression  within 60 days after onset/diagnosis. Depression was higher in the nonrecipient  group (21.06%) than in the favipiravir group (16.01%). After adjustment by other  factors, favipiravir prescription was found to be associated with depression (aOR  0.488, 95% CI 0.339-0.701 p < 0.001). In accordance with the PHQ-9 subset,  favipiravir exerted a significant protective effect against depressive mood and  loss of interest. However, patients living alone were prone to experiencing loss  of interest (aOR 2.253, 95% CI 1.329-3.818, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The data  obtained in this preliminary survey suggested that favipiravir may be useful for  preventing post-COVID depression. However, further study is needed. Moreover, the  provision of mental health support, particularly to those who live alone, must be  ensured. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registry NCT05060562.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In December 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection broke out in Wuhan, China. However, we still lack a  comprehensive understanding of this emerging virus. In this manuscript, we  collected relevant articles and reviewed the characteristics about SARS-CoV-2.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an online search on PubMed and Web of Science  with the keywords COVID-19, 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV-2, and summarized the  epidemiology, virology, clinical features and treatments of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  RESULTS: We retrieved 157 published papers about SARS-CoV-2 from January, 2020 to  April, 2020. We found that SARS-CoV-2 was a kind of virus with low mortality rate  and high infectivity. This virus can enter human cells through  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in alveoli and activate immune response in  human body. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be classified as asymptomatic, mild, common,  severe, and critical. We summarized antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, such as  remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir. Because the vaccine of SARS-CoV-2  is developing, more clinical studies are needed to verify the safety and efficacy  of these treatments. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has  caused a global pandemic. We should pay more attention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 and  try to control it sooner.

AB  - Favipiravir, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor, is used to treat patients infected with influenza virus and most recently with SARS-CoV-2.  However, poor accumulation of favipiravir in lung tissue following oral  administration has required an alternative method of administration that directly  targets the lungs. In this study, an inhalation solution of favipiravir at a  concentration of 2 mg mL(-1) was developed and characterized for the first time.  The chemical stability of inhaled favipiravir solution in two different media,  phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and normal saline (NS), was investigated under  different conditions: 5 ± 3 °C, 25 ± 2 °C/60% RH ± 5% RH, and 40 ± 2 °C/75% RH ±  5% RH; in addition to constant light exposure. As a result, favipiravir solution  in PBS revealed superior stability over 12 months at 5 ± 3 °C. Antiviral activity  of favipiravir was assessed at the concentrations between 0.25 and 3 mg mL(-1)  with real time cell analyzer on Vero-E6 that were infected with  SARS-CoV-2/B.1.36. The optimum concentration was found to be 2 mg mL(-1), where  minimum toxicity and sufficient antiviral activity was observed. Furthermore,  cell viability assay against Calu-3 lung epithelial cells confirmed the  biocompatibility of favipiravir at concentrations up to 50 μM (7.855 mg mL(-1)).  The in vitro aerodynamic profiles of the developed inhaled favipiravir  formulation, when delivered with soft-mist inhaler indicated good lung targeting  properties. These results suggest that favipiravir solution prepared with PBS  could be considered as a suitable and promising inhalation formulation for  pulmonary delivery in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

AB  - We propose a unique theoretical methodology because of the global high priority rating to search for the repurposed drugs that outfit clinical suitability to  SARS-CoV-2. The approach is based on the exploration of structural analysis,  computation of biothermodynamics, interactions and the prediction of entropy sign  successively via molecular dynamics. We tested this methodology for  Favipiravir/Dolutegravir drugs on the apo form of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. This  theoretical exploration not only suggested the presence of strong interactions  between (SARS-CoV-2 + Favipiravir/Dolutegravir) but also emphasized the clinical  suitability of Favipiravir over Dolutegravir to treat SARS-CoV-2 main protease.  The supremacy of Favipiravir over Doultegravir is well supported by the results  of global clinical trials on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, this work will pave the  way for incremental advancement towards future design and development of more  specific inhibitors to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.Communicated by  Ramaswamy H.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread globally since it outbroke in December 2019. The urgent pandemic presents an  unprecedented challenge to develop and identify effective medication therapy  strategies to combat the COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: Here, we summarized and  evaluated the current treatment drugs and regimens, and put forward the treatment  recommendations, including using the potential repurposed or experimental drugs  against COVID-19, e.g. chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ),  lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), remdesivir (RDV), and favipiravir (FPV). We also  analyzed the specific drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 ongoing development  and formulated the comprehensive treatment regimens based on condition of  patients, diseases and drugs as well as concomitant medications. EXPERT OPINION:  No drugs and vaccines have been proven to be particularly effective against  SARS-CoV-2 up to now. The recommended comprehensive medication therapy strategies  have already displayed favorable effect in the fight against COVID-19. Research  should be focused on the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and vaccines based  on high-quality clinical trial evidence, treatment guidelines and expert  consensus.

AB  - The lack of a vaccine or any effective treatment for the aggressive novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created a sense of urgency for the discovery  of effective drugs. Several repurposing pharmaceutical candidates have been  reported or envisaged to inhibit the emerging infections of severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but their binding sites, binding  affinities and inhibitory mechanisms are still unavailable. In this study, we use  the ligand-protein docking program and molecular dynamic simulation to ab initio  investigate the binding mechanism and inhibitory ability of seven clinically  approved drugs (Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Ritonavir,  Beclabuvir, Indinavir and Favipiravir) and a recently designed α-ketoamide  inhibitor (13b) at the molecular level. The results suggest that Chloroquine has  the strongest binding affinity with 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) among clinically  approved drugs, indicating its effective inhibitory ability for SARS-CoV-2.  However, the newly designed inhibitor 13b shows potentially improved inhibition  efficiency with larger binding energy compared with Chloroquine. We further  calculate the important binding site residues at the active site and demonstrate  that the MET 165 and HIE 163 contribute the most for 13b, while the MET 165 and  GLN 189 for Chloroquine, based on residual energy decomposition analysis. The  proposed work offers a higher research priority for 13b to treat the infection of  SARS-CoV-2 and provides theoretical basis for further design of effective drug  molecules with stronger inhibition.

T2  - Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry
AB  - Among antiviral drugs, the vast majority targets only one or two related viruses. The conventional model, one virus - one drug, significantly limits therapeutic  options. Therefore, in the strategy of controlling viral infections, there is a  necessity to develop compounds with pleiotropic effects. Favipiravir (FPV)  emerged as a strong candidate to become such a drug. The aim of the study is to  present up-to-date information on the role of favipiravir in the treatment of  viral respiratory infections. The anti-influenza activity of favipiravir has been  confirmed in cell culture experiments, animal models, and clinical trials.  Thoroughly different - from the previously registered drugs - mechanism of action  suggests that FVP can be used as a countermeasure for the novel or re-emerging  influenza virus infections. In recent months, favipiravir has been broadly  investigated due to its potential efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. Based on  preclinical and clinical studies and a recently published meta-analysis it seems  that favipiravir may be a promising antiviral drug in the treatment of patients  with COVID-19. FPV is also effective against other RNA respiratory viruses and  may be a candidate for the treatment of serious infections caused by human  rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses  and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could develop severe disease requiring critical care admission. Case reports indicated high incidence of  hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2,  which might be related to the drugs. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the risk  factors associated with HTG in this population and to investigate the  relationship between HTG and lipase. METHODS: A retrospective observational study  was conducted at our hospital between March 1 and June 30, 2020. Patients were  included if they were ≥18 years old, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU),  tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and had triglycerides (TG) checked during their  hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 111 critically ill patients, 103 patients were  included. Males comprised 88.3% of the sample. The median TG at baseline was  197.4 (IQR: 139.8-283) mg/dL. The lipase median level at baseline was 23.00 (IQR:  0.00-69.50) IU/L. The results of the mixed-effects logistic regression analysis  indicated that patient-level variables, favipiravir use, blood glucose level, and  propofol use were significantly associated with HTG. There was no relationship  between lipase and TG levels over time. Furthermore, TG concentrations over time  showed a similar trend to inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The  incidence of clinically significant HTG was high and was associated with propofol  and favipiravir use. HTG might reflect the high inflammatory state in these  patients. Clinicians should look at the full picture before changing therapies  based only on HTG. Our findings need to be replicated in a larger prospective  study.

AB  - Teratogenicity and hyperuricemia are considered as the major adverse effects of favipiravir, but less is known about other possible side effects which includes  drug-induced liver damage and renal injury. In the current research, assessment  of favipiravir-induced liver injury was performed by evaluating liver enzymes  among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection. A prospective cohort  study was conducted on 66 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19  infection who were treated with favipiravir for 5 days. During this period, a  baseline assessment of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase - AST, alanine  transaminase - ALT and alkaline phosphatase - ALP) in addition to bilirubin  before initiation of therapy and after 1 day of completion of therapy were  carried out. The comparison of all measured parameters among all patients before  and after receiving the treatment showed that non-significant differences were  obtained in their levels. It was noticed that COVID-19 patients demonstrated high  AST levels in which only 16 patients out of the all-subjected cases (66 patients)  had AST levels of less than 45 U/L whereas the majority of patients showed normal  ALT, ALP, and bilirubin levels. It was concluded that 5 days administration of  favipiravir in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients who had no previous liver  diseases did not affect the liver enzymes significantly and only transient  elevations were occurred.

T2  - European review for medical and pharmacological sciences
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There have been significant changes to the management of COVID-19 in recent months, including protocols and guidelines designed to prevent, diagnose,  and treat the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Several management options have been  suggested and have since gained popularity, though we expect additional  modifications to be made, as well as more new cases in the coming months, given a  lack of definitive treatment and well-controlled experiments. This review  highlights the available and potential treatments, along with the challenges  associated with each. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive  overview of all peer-reviewed studies, editorial comments, and letters to the  editor based on a search in PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus.  The following terms were used: "COVID-19," "SARS-CoV-2," "drug," "treatment,"  "medication," and "management." All searches were done between March and May 20,  2020. RESULTS: There are several potential medications available for COVID-19,  such as Interferon α (IFN-α), Teicoplanin, Ribavirin, Galidesivir,  Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Chloroquine phosphate, Arbidol, Velpatasvir, Favipiravir,  Ledipasvir, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Darunavir, Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QPD), and  Imatinib. However, we do not have a definitive and specific treatment yet.  CONCLUSIONS: We are expecting to have more cases in the coming weeks/months.  Therefore, further research is needed to characterize the disease behavior, to  find the absolute drug, and to refine the treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of favipiravir (FVP) as a COVID-19 treatment is recognized but not fully elucidated. We aimed to evaluate whether FVP has definite clinical  efficacy and safety in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: International and  Chinese databases were searched for randomized controlled clinical trials  evaluating FVP for the treatment of COVID-19. A meta-analysis was performed and  published literature was synthesized to evaluate the corresponding therapeutic  effects. RESULTS: We included 13 studies (1430 patients in total). Meta-analysis  showed that patients with mild-to-moderate disease treated with FVP had a  significantly higher viral clearance rate than those in the control group 10 and  14 days after initiation of treatment [RR: 1.13 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.28), P = 0.04;  I(2) = 39% for day 10 and RR: 1.16 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.30), P = 0.008; I(2) = 38%  for day 14] and a significantly shorter hospital stay [MD: -1.52 (95% CI: -2.82,  -0.23), P = 0.02; I(2) = 0%]. CONCLUSIONS: FVP significantly promotes viral  clearance and reduces the hospitalization duration in mild-to-moderate COVID-19  patients, which can reduce the risk of severe disease outcomes in patients.  However, more importantly, the results showed no benefit of FVP in severe  patients, and caution should be taken regarding the treatment options of FVP in  severe patients.

AB  - The guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of COVID-19. The clinical manifestations of the disease are described and indication  criteria for hospital admission of patients with COVID-19 are listed. Polymerase  chain reaction and antigen testing are used in direct diagnostics. Indirect  detection of infection by antibodies is currently of limited value. There are a  number of hematological and biochemical laboratory test used to diagnose  COVID-19. Pathological values of some laboratory parameters are associated with  severity of COVID-19. Of the imaging studies, chest X-ray, chest computer  tomography and lung ultrasound are used. COVID-19 therapy includes symptomatic  and specific therapy (antivirals, immunotherapeutics and anticoagulants) and  intensive care in the severe and critical forms of the disease. Remdesivir and  favipiravir are available as antiviral agents. Immunotherapeutics include  monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab/imdevimab, bamlanivimab/etesevimab),  dexamethas one, baricitinib and tocilizumab. Low-molecular-weight heparin is a  dominant form of anticoagulant therapy. The guidelines provide specific  therapeutic recommendations for each stage of the disease. Antibiotics are  recommended only if bacterial superinfection is suspected or demonstrated, which  is not common in the early stages of the disease.

AB  - The last couple of months have witnessed the world in a state of virtual standstill. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has overtaken the globe to economic and social  lockdown. Many patients with COVID-19 have compromised immunity, especially in an  aged population suffering from Parkinson 's disease (PD). Alteration in  dopaminergic neurons and deficiency of dopamine in PD patients are the most  common symptoms affecting 1% population above the age of 60 years. The  compromised immune system and inflammatory manifestation in PD patients make them  an easy target. The most common drugs under trial for COVID-19 are remdesivir,  favipiravir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin along with adjunct  drugs like amantadine with some monoclonal antibodies. Presently, clinically US  FDA approved drugs in PD include Levodopa, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT)  inhibitors, (Entacapone and Tolcapone), dopamine agonists (Bromocriptine,  Ropinirole, Pramipexole, and Rotigotine), monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors  (Selegiline and Rasagiline), amantadine and antimuscarinic drugs. The drugs have  established mechanisms of action on PD patients with known pharmacodynamics and  pharmacokinetic properties along with dose and adverse effects. Conclusion and  relevance of this review focus on the drugs that can be tried on PD patients with  SAR CoV-2 infection, in particular, amantadine that has been approved by all the  developed countries as a common drug possessing both antiviral properties by  downregulation of CTSL, lysosomal pathway disturbance and change in pH necessary  to uncoat the viral proteins and anti- Parkinson properties. To deal with the  significant prognostic adverse effect of SARS-CoV-2 on PD, the present-day  treatment options, clinical presentation and various mechanisms are the need of  the hour.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 is a β-CoV, which is enveloped by non-segmented positive-stranded RNA virüs. When β-CoV infects the respiratory tract, it can cause mild and/or  severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with consequent release of  cytokines/mediators, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7,  IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-10, IP10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, IL-33, IL-25, IL-37, IL-38, GCSF,  GM-CSF, HGF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α (also known as CCL3), IFN-γ, IFN-α, TRAIL,  MCSF, and TNF-α. Our hypothesis of writing this article can be summarized as; if  the monoclonal antibody (mAb) administered by us does not inhibit the immune  response for the β-CoV and inhibits uncontrolled-adaptive/hyperimmune responses  (also called cytokine storm) on endothelium level, then it may cause severe  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Anakinra is a human IL-1 receptor  antagonist. By inhibiting IL-1α/IL-1β competitively from binding to the IL-1  type-I receptor, anakinra, neutralizes the activity that pertains to these key  mediators of autoinflammatory and/or immune processes. Tocilizumab is a blocker  of IL-6R that can effectively block IL-6 signal transduction pathway. Omalizumab  that binds to the CH3 domain is near to the binding site for the high-affinity  IgE Fc receptors type-I of human IgE. Myocardial, lung and hepatorenal injury in  patients with COVID-19 could be due to cytokine storm, hypoxic injury, or/and  direct endothelial/vascular injury. We propose combination of mAbs with  remdesivir and/or favipiravir in severe COVID-19 cases, such as septic shock,  acute respiratory deficiency syndrome, and/or multiple organ failure. Finally, we  highlight the therapeutic mAbs that target patients with severe COVID-19.

AB  - Since December 2019 SARS-Cov-2 was found responsible for the disease COVID-19, which has spread worldwide. No specific therapies/vaccines are yet available for  the treatment of COVID-19. Drug repositioning may offer a strategy and a number  of drugs have been repurposed, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir,  favipiravir and tocilizumab. This paper describes the main pharmacological  properties of such drugs administered to patients with COVID-19, focusing on  their antiviral, immune-modulatory and/or anti-inflammatory actions. Where  available, data from clinical trials involving patients with COVID-19 are  reported. Preliminary clinical trials seem to support their benefit. However,  such drugs in COVID-19 patients have peculiar safety profiles. Thus, adequate  clinical trials are necessary for these compounds. Nevertheless, while waiting  for effective preventive measures i.e. vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs  belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway. Their results  will help us in defining the best way to treat COVID-19 and reducing its symptoms  and complications.

AB  - Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide that is produced by the lymphoid cells and plays a major role in immunological functions for controlling  the homeostasis of the immune system. VIP has been identified as a potent  anti-inflammatory factor, in boosting both innate and adaptive immunity. Since  December 2019, SARS-Cov-2 was found responsible for the disease COVID-19 which  has spread worldwide. No specific therapies or 100% effective vaccines are yet  available for the treatment of COVID-19. Drug repositioning may offer a strategy  and several drugs have been repurposed, including lopinavir/ritonavir,  remdesivir, favipiravir, and tocilizumab. This paper describes the main  pharmacological properties of synthetic VIP drug (Aviptadil) which is now under  clinical trials. A patented formulation of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide  (VIP), named RLF-100 (Aviptadil), was developed and finally got approved for  human trials by FDA in 2001 and in European medicines agency in 2005. It was  awarded Orphan Drug Designation in 2001 by the US FDA for the treatment of acute  respiratory distress syndrome and for the treatment of pulmonary arterial  hypertension in 2005. Investigational new drug (IND) licenses for human trials of  Aviptadil was guaranteed by both the US FDA and EMEA. Preliminary clinical trials  seem to support Aviptadil's benefit. However, such drugs like Aviptadil in  COVID-19 patients have peculiar safety profiles. Thus, adequate clinical trials  are necessary for these compounds.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: SARS-CoV-2, a ribonucleic acid coronavirus, rapidly spread worldwide within a short timeframe. Although different antiviral,  antiinflammatory, and immunomodulatory drugs are used, current evidence is  insufficient as to which drug is more efficient. Our study compared favipiravir  and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) therapies in inpatient care for coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic data, test  results, treatments, and latest status of patients receiving inpatient COVID-19  pneumonia therapy were recorded. The initial favipiravir and LPV/RTV receiving  groups were compared regarding the need for intensive care units (ICU) and  mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed by including variables  showing significant differences as a result of paired comparisons into the model.  RESULTS: Of the 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 59 (28.9%), 131 (64.2%),  and 14 were administered LPV/RTV, favipiravir, and favipiravir with LPV/RTV,  respectively. No difference was found in age, sex, presence of comorbidity, and  tocilizumab, systemic corticosteroid, and plasma therapy use between patients  administered with these three different treatment regimens. The mean mortality  age of the patients was 71 ± 14.3 years, which was substantially greater than  that of the survivors (54.2 ± 15.5 years). Compared with patients administered  with LPV/RTV, ICU admission and mortality rates were lower in patients  administered with favipiravir. CK-MB, AST, CRP, LDH, and creatinine levels were  higher, whereas lymphocyte counts were lower in patients who died. Age, AST, CRP,  LDH, and neutrophil counts were higher in patients needing ICU, and eosinophil  and lymphocyte counts were significantly lower. Logistic regression analysis  showed that favipiravir use independently decreased mortality (p = 0.006).  CONCLUSION: The use of favipiravir was more effective than LPV/RTV in reducing  mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory  illness. COVID-19 has now become a global public health crisis causing alarming  numbers of morbidity and mortality. Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic started  scientists, researchers, universities, companies, and institutions all around the  world have been endeavoring to discover a potential treatment for COVID-19.  Numerous studies and clinical trials on vaccines and drugs for the prevention and  treatment of COVID-19 are underway across the world. However, the uncertainty  around the efficacy and safety of various treatment regimens have become one of  the biggest challenges in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2. This paper is a  narrative review of articles regarding the various treatments and vaccines being  tested for the SARS-CoV-2, available in the PubMed database along with Google  Scholar. There are ongoing clinical trials on potential drugs such as remdesivir,  favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine,  corticosteroids tocilizumab, azithromycin, anakinra, etc. and other therapeutic  modalities like convalescent plasma therapy. Likewise, vaccines against  SARS-CoV-2 are being developed and tested, including mRNA, non-replicating viral  vector, DNA, protein subunit candidate vaccines, etc. Although some early-stage  clinical trials and studies on these drugs and vaccines have shown positive  results, definitive and conclusive results are yet to be obtained. Keywords:  COVID-19; antiviral drugs; COVID-19 treatment; COVID-19 vaccine; SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, large in silico screening studies and numerous in vitro studies have assessed the antiviral activity of various  drugs on SARS-CoV-2. In the context of health emergency, drug repurposing  represents the most relevant strategy because of the reduced time for approval by  international medicines agencies, the low cost of development and the well-known  toxicity profile of such drugs. Herein, we aim to review drugs with in vitro  antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, combined with molecular docking data and  results from preliminary clinical studies. Finally, when considering all these  previous findings, as well as the possibility of oral administration, 11  molecules consisting of nelfinavir, favipiravir, azithromycin, clofoctol,  clofazimine, ivermectin, nitazoxanide, amodiaquine, heparin, chloroquine and  hydroxychloroquine, show an interesting antiviral activity that could be  exploited as possible drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a contagious acute respiratory infectious disease whose causative agent has been demonstrated to be a novel  virus of the coronavirus family, SARSCoV-2. A recent PRE-print study has showed a  heme attack on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin by COVID19. Beta-thalassemia  results of a default in the hemoglobin beta-chain synthesis. 1,5% global  population are heterozygotes for this disease. In this study, by a multiple  linear regression, we have analyzed the evolution of COVID-19 infection in three  Italian regions (Puglia, Sardinia, Sicilia) with different beta-thalassemic  prevalences, in order to search a link. The results have showed that  betathalassemic heterozygote population prevalence is correlated to immunity  against COVID-19, by a regression. This paper is only for academic discussion,  the hypotheses and conclusions needs to be confirmed by further research.

AB  - AIMS: Limited data about disease management strategies are available for pediatric patients with coronavirus disease-2019, particularly in Turkey. This  study aimed to share the data on patients aged under 18 years in our country to  be beneficial for understanding the disease course in children. METHODS: A  retrospective review of the medical records of pediatric patients aged under 18  years who were confirmed as coronavirus disease-2019 between March 11, and June  23, 2020, and were admitted to our hospitals was conducted. RESULTS: A total of  220 pediatric patients with coronavirus disease-2019 were evaluated, of which  48.2% were boys, with a median age of 10 years, and 9.5% had underlying diseases.  Patients were classified according to severity, with the percentages of  asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and critical/severe cases determined to be 25.5%,  45%, 26.8%, and 2.7%, respectively. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was  required in two patients (0.9%) and mechanical ventilation in three (1.4%).  Targeted therapies were used in six patients (2.7%), with hydroxychloroquine  being the most commonly used agent either alone (one patient) or in combination  with favipiravir (five patients). Two patients (0.9%) died, and nine (4.1%) were  still hospitalized during the study period. CONCLUSION: Although the disease  course of coronavirus disease-2019 seems to be mild in children, critical illness  is significant, and the treatment strategy primarily should consist of supportive  care according to our preliminary observations.

AB  - In late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, several patients with viral pneumonia were identified as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). So far, there are no specific  treatments for patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), and the  treatments available today are based on previous experience with similar viruses  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle  East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Influenza virus. In this  article, we have tried to reach a therapeutic window of drugs available to  patients with COVID-19. Cathepsin L is required for entry of the 2019-nCoV virus  into the cell as target teicoplanin inhibits virus replication.  Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) in soluble form as a recombinant protein  can prevent the spread of coronavirus by restricting binding and entry. In  patients with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine decreases the inflammatory response  and cytokine storm, but overdose causes toxicity and mortality. Neuraminidase  inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for  2019-nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as  lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS-CoV disease and can  be useful for patients of COVID-19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct  antiviral effect on early replication of SARS-CoV. Ribavirin reduces hemoglobin  concentrations in respiratory patients, and remdesivir improves respiratory  symptoms. Use of ribavirin in combination with LPV/r in patients with SARS-CoV  reduces acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, which has a  significant protective effect with the addition of corticosteroids. Favipiravir  increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger  antiviral effect than LPV/r. currently, appropriate treatment for patients with  COVID-19 is an ACE2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as  favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.

AB  - The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is causing a worldwide pandemic that may lead to a highly morbid and potentially fatal coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is currently no drug that has been proven as an  effective therapy for COVID-19. Several candidate drugs are being considered and  evaluated for treatment. This includes clinically available drugs, such as  chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir, which are being  repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. Novel experimental therapies, such as  remdesivir and favipiravir, are also actively being investigated for antiviral  efficacy. Clinically available and investigational immunomodulators, such as the  interleukin 6 inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab and the  anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor lenzilumab, are being  tested for their anticipated effect in counteracting the pro-inflammatory  cytokine environment that characterizes severe and critical COVID-19. This review  article examines the evidence behind the potential use of these leading drug  candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. The authors conclude, based on this  review, that there is still no high-quality evidence to support any of these  proposed drug therapies. The authors, therefore, encourage the enrollment of  eligible patients to multiple ongoing clinical trials that assess the efficacy  and safety of these candidate therapies. Until the results of controlled trials  are available, none of the suggested therapeutics is clinically proven as an  effective therapy for COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in China. There are no available vaccines or antiviral drugs for COVID-19  patients. Herein, we represented possible therapeutic agents that may stand as a  potential therapy against COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: We searched PubMed, Google  Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov for relevant papers. We showed some agents with  potentially favorable efficacy, acceptable safety as well as good pharmacokinetic  profiles. Several therapies are under assessment to evaluate their efficacy and  safety for COVID-19. However, some drugs were withdrawn due to their side effects  after demonstrating some clinical efficacy. Indeed, the most effective therapies  could be organ function support, convalescent plasma, anticoagulants, and immune  as well as antiviral therapies, especially anti-influenza drugs due to the  similarities between respiratory viruses regarding viral entry, uncoating, and  replication. We encourage giving more attention to favipiravir, remdesivir, and  measles vaccine. EXPERT OPINION: A combination, at least dual or even triple  therapy, of the aforementioned efficacious and safe therapies is greatly  recommended for COVID-19. Further, patients should have a routine assessment for  their coagulation and bleeding profiles as well as their inflammatory and  cytokine concentrations.

AB  - Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in December 2019, more than 2,500,000 people worldwide have been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 as of  April 22. In response to this epidemic, China has issued seven trial versions of  diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19. According to the information that  we have collected so far, this article provides an overview of potential  therapeutic drugs and compounds with much attention, including favipiravir and  hydroxychloroquine, as well as traditional Chinese medicine, which have been  reported with good clinical treatment effects. Moreover, with further  understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virus, new drugs targeting specific SARS-CoV-2 viral  components arise and investigations on these novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents are  also reviewed.

AB  - Despite no or limited pre-clinical evidence, repurposed drugs are massively evaluated in clinical trials to palliate the lack of antiviral molecules against  SARS-CoV-2. Here we use a Syrian hamster model to assess the antiviral efficacy  of favipiravir, understand its mechanism of action and determine its  pharmacokinetics. When treatment is initiated before or simultaneously to  infection, favipiravir has a strong dose effect, leading to reduction of  infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation of the disease. Antiviral  effect of favipiravir correlates with incorporation of a large number of  mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity. Antiviral  efficacy is achieved with plasma drug exposure comparable with those previously  found during human clinical trials. Notably, the highest dose of favipiravir  tested is associated with signs of toxicity in animals. Thereby, pharmacokinetic  and tolerance studies are required to determine whether similar effects can be  safely achieved in humans.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly challenging due to a lack of established therapies and treatment guidelines. With the rapid  transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been  impeded by limited availability. Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics  are being considered for treatment at this time. The purpose of this literature  review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for  COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals. OBJECTIVES: This  narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy  options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,  and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a  combination of the keywords "COVID 19," "SARS-CoV-2," and "treatment." All types  of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and  clinical guidelines. DISCUSSION: There are currently no therapeutic drugs  available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several  antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies. Current guidelines  recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or  chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate  disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence. Remdesivir  and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory  failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited. Interleukin-6 (IL-6)  antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release  syndrome (CRS). Corticosteroids should be avoided unless there is evidence of  refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another  compelling indication for their use. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be  discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever. CONCLUSION: There  are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and  combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are  under development. Until the results of these trials become available, we must  use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.  Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around  the world to combat this pandemic.

AB  - Experiments with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are limited by the need for biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions. A SARS-CoV-2  replicon system rather than an in vitro infection system is suitable for  antiviral screening since it can be handled under BSL2 conditions and does not  produce infectious particles. However, the reported replicon systems are  cumbersome because of the need for transient transfection in each assay. In this  study, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome vector (the replicon-BAC  vector) including the SARS-CoV-2 replicon and a fusion gene encoding Renilla  luciferase and neomycin phosphotransferase II, examined the antiviral effects of  several known compounds, and then established a cell line stably harboring the  replicon-BAC vector. Several cell lines transiently transfected with the  replicon-BAC vector produced subgenomic replicon RNAs (sgRNAs) and viral  proteins, and exhibited luciferase activity. In the transient replicon system,  treatment with remdesivir or interferon-β but not with camostat or favipiravir  suppressed the production of viral agents and luciferase, indicating that  luciferase activity corresponds to viral replication. VeroE6/Rep3, a stable  replicon cell line based on VeroE6 cells, was successfully established and  continuously produced viral proteins, sgRNAs and luciferase, and their production  was suppressed by treatment with remdesivir or interferon-β. Molnupiravir, a  novel coronavirus RdRp inhibitor, inhibited viral replication more potently in  VeroE6/Rep3 cells than in VeroE6-based transient replicon cells. In summary, our  stable replicon system will be a powerful tool for the identification of  SARS-CoV-2 antivirals through high-throughput screening.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been on the agenda of humanity for more than 2 years. In the meantime, the pandemic has caused economic  shutdowns, halt of daily lives and global mobility, overcrowding of the  healthcare systems, panic, and worse, more than 6 million deaths. Today, there is  still no specific therapy for COVID-19. Research focuses on repurposing of  antiviral drugs that are licensed or currently in the research phase, with a  known systemic safety profile. However, local safety profile should also be  evaluated depending on the new indication, administration route and dosage form.  Additionally, various vaccines have been developed. But the causative virus,  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has undergone  multiple variations, too. The premise that vaccines may suffice to eradicate new  and all variants is unreliable, as they are based on earlier versions of the  virus. Therefore, a specific medication therapy for COVID-19 is crucial and  needed in order to prevent severe complications of the disease. Even though there  is no specific drug that inhibits the replication of the disease-causing virus,  among the current treatment options, systemic antivirals are the most medically  appropriate. As SARS-CoV-2 directly targets the lungs and initiates lung damage,  treating COVID-19 with inhalants can offer many advantages over the  enteral/parenteral administration. Inhaled drug delivery provides higher drug  concentration, specifically in the pulmonary system. This enables the reduction  of systemic side effects and produces a rapid clinical response. In this article,  the most frequently (systemically) used antiviral compounds are reviewed  including Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Umifenovir,  Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine and Heparin. A comprehensive literature search  was conducted to provide insight into the potential inhaled use of these  antiviral drugs and the current studies on inhalation therapy for COVID-19 was  presented. A brief evaluation was also made on the use of inhaler devices in the  treatment of COVID-19. Inhaled antivirals paired with suitable inhaler devices  should be considered for COVID-19 treatment options.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA enveloped viruses, members of the family Coronaviridae, that cause infections in a broad range of mammals including  humans. Several CoV species lead to mild upper respiratory infections typically  associated with common colds. However, three human CoV (HCoV) species: Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome  (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, are responsible for severe respiratory diseases at  the origin of two recent epidemics (SARS and MERS), and of the current  COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19), respectively. The easily transmissible  SARS-CoV-2, emerging at the end of 2019 in China, spread rapidly worldwide,  leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 a pandemic. While  the world waits for mass vaccination, there is an urgent need for effective drugs  as short-term weapons to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context, the  drug repurposing approach is a strategy able to guarantee positive results  rapidly. In this regard, it is well known that several nucleoside-mimicking  analogs and nucleoside precursors may inhibit the growth of viruses providing  effective therapies for several viral diseases, including HCoV infections.  Therefore, this review will focus on synthetic nucleosides and nucleoside  precursors active against different HCoV species, paying great attention to  SARS-CoV-2. This work covers progress made in anti-CoV therapy with nucleoside  derivatives and provides insight into their main mechanisms of action.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Kidney transplant recipients are among the high-risk groups for severe COVID-19. To date, no specific antiviral agent has proved uniformly  effective against SARS-CoV-2. Favipiravir, the recommended drug by the Turkish  Ministry of Health, was uniformly supplied to all patients diagnosed with  COVID-19 by a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test. The  aim of our study was to retrospectively compare our kidney transplant recipients  treated with favipiravir who developed COVID-19 infection versus those not  treated with favipiravir during the clinical course of the disease, with a  special emphasis on the occurrence of side effects and adverse events. MATERIALS  AND METHODS: We included 37 consecutive kidney transplant recipients with a  median age of 46 years (62.2% women). Recipients included 8 with deceased donors  and 29 with living related donors; median posttransplant survival was 8.0 years  (IQR, 5.5-12.5 years). RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (70.3%) received favipiravir,  and 11 (29.7%) did not. There were no statistically significant differences  between the groups for baseline demographic characteristics and clinical and  laboratory data, except that the favipiravir-treated patients were older and had  a higher requirement of oxygen treatment. There were no statistically significant  differences between the 2 groups for the course and outcome of COVID-19 infection  with regard to adverse side effects/events associated with favipiravir.  Laboratory data at baseline, day 7, and day 30 were also comparable between the  groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although the efficacy of favipiravir for treatment of  COVID-19 infection remains controversial, favipiravir is safe for kidney  transplant recipients.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Betacoronavirus group, an unusually large RNA genome characterized by club-like spikes that project from their surface. An  outbreak of a novel coronavirus 2019 (nCOVID-19) already showed a unique  replication strategy and infection that has posed significant threat to  international health and the economy around the globe. Scientists around the  world are investigating few previously used clinical drugs for the treatment of  COVID-19. This review provides synthesis and mode of action of recently  investigated drugs like Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, Selamectin,  Remdesivir, Baricitinib, Darunavir, Favipiravir, Lopinavir/ ritonavir and  Mefloquine hydrochloride that constitute an option for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several reports linked the use of repurposed drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir with  QT interval prolongation in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Little is known  about the risk factors for QT interval prolongation in this population. We sought  to describe the prevalence and identify the main risk factors associated with  clinically significant corrected QT (QTc) prolongation in this population.  METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of critically ill patients who  were admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU), had at least one  electrocardiogram performed during their ICU stay, and tested positive for  SARs-CoV-2. Clinically significant QTc interval prolongation was defined as QTc  >500 milliseconds (ms). RESULTS: Out of the 111 critically ill patients with  SARS-CoV-2 infection, QTc was significantly prolonged in 47 cases (42.3%).  Patients with a clinically significant QTc prolongation had significantly higher  proportions of history of cardiac diseases/surgery (22 [46.8%] vs. 10 [15.6%], P  < .001), hypokalemia (10 [21.3] vs. 5 [7.8%], P = .04), and male gender (95% vs.  82.8%, P = .036) than patients with QTc ≤500 ms, respectively. A total of 46  patients (41.4%) received HCQ, 28 (25.2%) received lopinavir/ritonavir, and 5  (4.5%) received azithromycin. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed  that a history of cardiac disease was the only independent factor associated with  clinically significant QTc prolongation (P = .004 for the likelihood-ratio test).  CONCLUSION: The prevalence of clinically significant QTc prolongation in  critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was high and independent of  drugs used. Larger prospective observational studies are warranted to elucidate  independent risk factors associated with clinically significant QTc prolongation  in this study population.

AB  - COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease at first was  identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Being a human infectious  disease, it causes high fever, cough, breathing problems. In some cases it can be  fatal, especially in people with comorbidities like heart or kidney problems and  diabetes. The current COVID-19 treatment is based on symptomatic therapy, so  finding an appropriate drug against COVID-19 remains an immediate and crucial  target for the global scientific community. Two main processes are thought to be  responsible for the COVID-19 pathogenesis. In the early stages of infection,  disease is determined mainly by virus replication. In the later stages of  infection, by an excessive immune/inflammatory response, leading to tissue  damage. Therefore, the main treatment options are antiviral and  immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory agents. Many clinical trials have been  conducted concerning the use of various drugs in COVID-19 therapy, and many are  still ongoing. The majority of trials examine drug reposition (repurposing),  which seems to be a good and effective option. Many drugs have been repurposed in  COVID-19 therapy including remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab and baricitinib.  The aim of this review is to highlight (based on existing and accessible clinical  evidence on ongoing trials) the current and available promising drugs for  COVID-19 and outline their characteristics.

AB  - Favipiravir, a broad-spectrum RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, inhibits the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  at significantly lower concentrations than the plasma trough levels achieved by  the dosage adopted for influenza treatment and exhibits efficacy against  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Although high doses of favipiravir  are required due to the molecule being a purine analog, its conversion into the  active form in infected cells with active viral RNA synthesis enhances the  antiviral specificity and selectivity as a chain terminator with lethal  mutagenesis. Another characteristic feature is the lack of generation of  favipiravir-resistant virus. COVID-19 pneumonia is caused by strong cell-mediated  immunity against virus-infected cells, and the inflammatory response induced by  adaptive immunity continues to peak for 3 to 5 days despite antiviral treatment.  This has also been observed in herpes zoster (HZ) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)  pneumonia. Inflammation due to an immune response may mask the effectiveness of  favipiravir against COVID-19 pneumonia. Favipiravir significantly shortened the  recovery time in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia by 3 days with the start  of treatment by the 5th day of symptom onset. Since both CMV and COVID-19  pneumonia are caused by adaptive immunity and prevention of cytomegalovirus  pneumonia is the standard treatment due to difficulties in treating refractory  CMV pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia should be prevented with early treatment as  well. In the present study, we have comprehensively reviewed the optimal  antiviral therapy for COVID-19 based on clinical trials of favipiravir for the  treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia and the concurrently established therapies for  other viral infections, particularly HZ and CMV pneumonia. Optimally, antivirals  should be administered immediately after COVID-19 diagnosis, similar to that  after influenza diagnosis, to prevent COVID-19 pneumonia and complications  resulting from microangiopathy.

Here we report the structure of favipiravir ribonucleoside triphosphate  (favipiravir-RTP) in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  (RdRp) bound to a template:primer RNA duplex, determined by electron  cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to a resolution of 2.5 Å. The structure shows clear  evidence for the inhibitor at the catalytic site of the enzyme, and resolves the  conformation of key side chains and ions surrounding the binding pocket.  Polymerase activity assays indicate that the inhibitor is weakly incorporated  into the RNA primer strand, and suppresses RNA replication in the presence of  natural nucleotides. The structure reveals an unusual, nonproductive binding mode  of favipiravir-RTP at the catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, which explains its  low rate of incorporation into the RNA primer strand. Together, these findings  inform current and future efforts to develop polymerase inhibitors for SARS  coronaviruses.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global pandemic. Up to  now, numerous medicines have been applied or approved for the prevention and  control of the virus infection. However, the efficiency of each medicine or  combination is completely different or still unknown. In this review, we discuss  the types, characteristics, antiviral mechanisms, and shortcomings of recommended  candidate medicines for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as perspectives of the  drugs for the disease treatment, which may provide a theoretical basis for drug  screening and application.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Favipiravir (FPV) is an orally administrable antiviral drug that selectively inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and has been repurposed for  COVID-19 treatment. There is limited information on the use of FPV in kidney  transplant recipients (KTx), who often have multiple comorbidities and run a  higher risk for death from COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all KTx  at our institution who got sick with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and May 31,  2021, and who received FPV (loading dose of 1800 mg × 2 on day 1, maintenance  dose 2  ×  800 mg/d for 5-14 days) as part of their COVID treatment. We analyzed  demographics, clinical course, laboratory data, management, and outcome. RESULTS:  Nine KTx with COVID-19 received FPV; all were hospitalized. The median age was 52  years (range, 32-60 years), and women were predominant (77.7%). Eight KTx had  pulmonary involvement on chest radiograph. On admission 1 patient had mild, 5 had  moderate, 2 had severe, and 1 had critical disease. Leukopenia and increased  creatinine were universally noted. Three patients had disease progression under  treatment. Seven patients (77.7%) required additional oxygen, and 4 (57.1%)  needed intensive care unit admission. Three KTx died, resulting in an overall  mortality of 33.3%. Survivors did not show increased transaminases or creatinine  during or after FPV treatment; leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets improved on  discharge compared with admission values. CONCLUSIONS: FPV appears well tolerated  by KTx with COVID-19, but its clinical benefit remains unclear. Larger analyses  are needed.

AB  - We retrospectively studied nasopharyngeal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  patients who were hospitalized between January 13 and April 1, 2020. Quantitative  real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted  using primers and probes targeting the ORF1ab and N genes. All patients were  classified in the following groups: Group 1: received favipiravir + chloroquine  or hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir for 5-10 days,  Group 2: received chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir or  darunavir/ritonavir for 5-10 days, and Group 3: no antiviral medication. Among  the 115 patients, 38 (33%), 54 (47%), and 23 (20%) were in Groups 1, 2, and 3,  respectively. The median (IQR) baseline viral loads on day 0 of Groups 1, 2, and  3 were 7.2 (6.0-8.1), 6.9 (5.8-7.8), and 6.9 (5.8-7.6) log(10) copies/mL,  respectively. The reductions of mean viral loads on day 3 from baseline were  2.41, 1.38, and 2.19 log(10) copies/mL in the corresponding groups (P < 0.05).  There were no differences in the reduction of mean viral loads from baseline  among the three groups on days 5 and 10 (P > 0.05). Multiple logistic regression  analysis showed that receiving favipiravir was associated with nasopharyngeal  viral load reduction at three days (P = 0.001). Significant nasopharyngeal  SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduction was achieved in COVID-19 patients who received a  favipiravir-containing regimen.

T2  - Current opinion in virology
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of nucleoside analogs to treat respiratory virus infections, with remdesivir being the first compound to  receive worldwide authorization and three other nucleoside analogs (i.e.  favipiravir, molnupiravir, and bemnifosbuvir) in the pipeline. Here, we summarize  the current knowledge concerning their clinical efficacy in suppressing the virus  and reducing the need for hospitalization or respiratory support. We also mention  trials of favipiravir and lumicitabine, for influenza and respiratory syncytial  virus, respectively. Besides, we outline how nucleoside analogs interact with the  polymerases of respiratory viruses, to cause lethal virus mutagenesis or  disturbance of viral RNA synthesis. In this way, we aim to convey the key  findings on this rapidly evolving class of respiratory virus medication.

AB  - An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus capable of causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was  declared as a global public health emergency on January 30, 2020, by the World  Health Organization. In this devastating situation, precautionary measures, early  diagnosis, and repurposed drugs appear to be timely and decisive factors by which  to handle this problem until the discovery of an effective, dedicated vaccine or  medicine is made. Currently, some researchers and clinicians have claimed  evidence exists in favor of the use of some antimalarial drugs (chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine) antiviral drugs (remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir,  ritonavir, umifenovir) vitamins, traditional Chinese medicines, and herbal  medicines against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the available literature, this  review article sought to highlight the current understanding of the origin,  transmission, diagnosis, precautionary measures, infection and drug action  mechanisms, therapeutic role, and toxicities of targeted drugs for the prevention  and cure of COVID-19. This review may be useful for developing further strategies  as a blueprint and understanding the mentioned drugs' mechanisms to elucidate the  possible target of action by which to successfully freeze the replication of the  SARS-CoV-2 virus.

AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 outbreak has infected 34.20 million people with 1019 thousand deaths in more than 125 countries till 30 September 2020. Due to the  unavailability of vaccine or targeted novel drug therapy against Severe Acute  Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), screening of existential medical  treatments facilitates identification of promising drugs for the treatment and  management of COVID-19.Areas covered: The review article highlights repurposing  of antiviral, antimalarial, antineoplastic, antidiabetic, analgesic, and  immunomodulatory drugs. Furthermore, clinical trials, in-vitro studies, benefits,  adverse effects, toxicities, mechanisms of action, and regulatory status of drugs  are covered in this article.Expert opinion: Lack of conclusive results from  randomized clinical trials indicates absence of specific drugs for treatment of  COVID-19. Unavailability of complete data regarding safety, efficacy, and adverse  reactions of drugs restricts the recommendation of clinical advice on dose and  duration of the drug therapy. Remdesivir and favipiravir show promising outcomes  but more clinical evidence is required for use in large populations. Experimental  and repurposed drug therapies targeting spike and envelope proteins, Mpro,  3CL(pro) and PL(pro) enzymes, and RdRp and TMPRSS2 genes show capability to  produce effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 action. Development of vaccine against  SARS-CoV-2 will offer long-term solution to terminate spread of this global  pandemic.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is the worst worldwide pandemic with more than 12,000,000 cases and 560,000 deaths until 14th July 2020. Men were more  infected by COVID-19 than women, and male subjects with underlying conditions,  including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases developed a severe  form of the affection, with increased mortality rate. Many factors can contribute  to the disparity in disease outcomes, such as hormone-specific reaction and  activity of X-linked genes, which modulate the innate and adaptive immune  response to virus infection. Until now, only the Remdesivir was approved by FDA  (Food Drug Administration) for COVID-19 treatment, although several clinical  trials are ongoing worldwide also on other drugs. In this review, we analyzed  published studies on several drugs (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine,  remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir-ritonavir in combination, tocilizumab, plasma,  and immunoglobulins) with some efficacy to COVID-19 in humans, and evaluated if  there were a gender analysis of the available data. In our opinion, it is  essential to report data about COVID-19 disaggregated by sex, age, and race,  because the knowledge of gender differences is fundamental to identify effective  and customized treatments to reduce hospitalizations, admissions to intensive  care units, and mortality.

AB  - Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are powerful theoretical methods that can reveal biomolecular properties, such as structure, fluctuations, and ligand  binding, at the level of atomic detail. In this review article, recent MD  simulation studies on these biomolecular properties of the RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase (RdRp), which is a multidomain protein, of severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are presented. Although the tertiary  structures of RdRps in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are almost identical, the RNA  synthesis activity of RdRp of SARS-CoV is higher than SARS-CoV-2. Recent MD  simulations observed a difference in the dynamic properties of the two RdRps,  which may cause activity differences. RdRp is also a drug target for Coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nucleotide analogs, such as remdesivir and favipiravir,  are considered to be taken up by RdRp and inhibit RNA replication. Recent MD  simulations revealed the recognition mechanism of RdRp for these drug molecules  and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The ligand-recognition ability of RdRp  decreases in the order of remdesivir, favipiravir, and ATP. As a typical  recognition process, it was found that several lysine residues of RdRp transfer  these ligand molecules to the binding site such as a "bucket brigade." This  finding will contribute to understanding the mechanism of the efficient ligand  recognition by RdRp. In addition, various simulation studies on the complexes of  SARS-CoV-2 RdRp with several nucleotide analogs are reviewed, and the molecular  mechanisms by which these compounds inhibit the function of RdRp are discussed.  The simulation studies presented in this review will provide useful insights into  how nucleotide analogs are recognized by RdRp and inhibit the RNA replication.

TI  - Potential Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Therapeutics That Target the Post-Entry Stages of the Viral Life Cycle: A Comprehensive Review.
AU  - Al-Horani, Rami A.

T2  - Viruses
AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to challenge health care systems around the world. Scientists and pharmaceutical companies have  promptly responded by advancing potential therapeutics into clinical trials at an  exponential rate. Initial encouraging results have been realized using remdesivir  and dexamethasone. Yet, the research continues so as to identify better  clinically relevant therapeutics that act either as prophylactics to prevent the  infection or as treatments to limit the severity of COVID-19 and substantially  decrease the mortality rate. Previously, we reviewed the potential therapeutics  in clinical trials that block the early stage of the viral life cycle. In this  review, we summarize potential anti-COVID-19 therapeutics that block/inhibit the  post-entry stages of the viral life cycle. The review presents not only the  chemical structures and mechanisms of the potential therapeutics under clinical  investigation, i.e., listed in clinicaltrials.gov, but it also describes the  relevant results of clinical trials. Their anti-inflammatory/immune-modulatory  effects are also described. The reviewed therapeutics include small molecules,  polypeptides, and monoclonal antibodies. At the molecular level, the therapeutics  target viral proteins or processes that facilitate the post-entry stages of the  viral infection. Frequent targets are the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  (RdRp) and the viral proteases such as papain-like protease (PL(pro)) and main  protease (M(pro)). Overall, we aim at presenting up-to-date details of  anti-COVID-19 therapeutics so as to catalyze their potential effective use in  fighting the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Remdesivir, which was first developed for the treatment of Ebola disease but failed to meet expectations, has become hope in the fight against the  COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors for mortality and  prognosis of adult moderate/severe COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir, and  safety and tolerability of 5 days of remdesivir treatment. METHODS: This  multicenter prospective observational study was conducted in 14 centers in  Turkey. Pregnancy or breastfeeding, multiorgan failure, or usage of vasopressors  for septic shock, ALT > 5 × the upper limit of the normal range, or eGRF <30  mL/min or dialysis and receiving favipiravir were the exclusion criteria of the  study. RESULTS: Among 500 patients, 494 patients were included in the study. On  admission, 392 (79.3%) patients had moderate and 102 (20.6%) patients had severe  COVID-19. The 28-day mortality was 10.1%. The median of the scores of the  seven-category ordinal scale assessed on days 0, 3, 5, 7 were 4 and 3 on day 14.  When the survival status of the patients was evaluated according to the time  between the remdesivir start date and the end date of the symptoms, no  statistically significant difference was found between the medians of the groups  (p = 0.404). In multivariable analysis, age (OR, 1.05; 95%CI, 1.02-1.08; p =  0.003), SpO2 level on admission (OR, 3.03; 95%CI, 1.35-6.81; p = 0.007), heart  rate (OR, 2.48; 95%CI, 1.01-6.07; p = 0.047), follow-up site at the hospital  (clinic/ICU) (OR, 26.4; 95%CI, 11.6-60.17; p < 0.001) were independently  associated with increased mortality. Grade 3 adverse event (AE) was observed in 4  (0.8%) patients. None of the patients experienced grade 4 or 5 AEs. DISCUSSION:  Remdesivir is a safe and well-tolerated drug and older age, low SpO2 level on  admission, tachycardia, and ICU admission are independently associated with  increased mortality among patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 receiving  remdesivir treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Favipiravir is one of the essential antiviral drugs used for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in some countries. However, there is  not enough information about used, especially in pregnancy. Therefore, in this  study, it was aimed to determine the developmental toxicity of favipiravir on  fetal bone development and embryonic development. METHODS: In this study, 16  pregnant wistar albino rats were used. The rats were divided into four groups:  Control (saline) and Group A (50 mg/kg × 5 days), Group B  (50 mg/kg × 1 days + 20 mg/kg × 4 days), Group C (20 mg/kg × 5 days). Solutions  were administered to the rats by oral gavage from the 10th to 14th days of  pregnancy, twice a day. The skeletal system development of fetuses was examined  with double skeletal staining and immunohistochemical staining methods. RESULTS:  A total of 72 fetuses from pregnant rats, 18 in each group, were included in the  study. As a result, depending on favipiravir dose increase, in experimental  groups, it was determined that the statistically significant decrease on the  ossification rates of anterior and posterior extremity bones, and length and  weight of fetuses. CONCLUSION: Exposure to favipiravir during pregnancy impairs  bone metabolism and bone formation-resorption stages and may cause developmental  delay.

AB  - Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been an international public health emergency. The possibility of COVID-19 should be  considered primarily in patients with new-onset fever or respiratory tract  symptoms. However, these symptoms can occur with other viral respiratory  illnesses. We reported a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  and influenza A virus coinfection. During the epidemic, the possibility of  COVID-19 should be considered regardless of positive findings for other  pathogens.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since then, the virus has stretched  its grip to almost all the countries in the world, affecting millions of people  and causing enormous casualties. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared  COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2019. As of June 12, 2020, almost 7.30 million  people have already been infected globally, with 413,000 reported casualties. In  the United States alone, 2.06 million people have been infected and 115,000 have  succumbed to this pandemic. A multipronged approach has been launched toward  combating this pandemic, with the main focus on exhaustive screening, developing  efficacious therapies, and vaccines for long-term immunity. Several  pharmaceutical companies in collaboration with various academic institutions and  governmental organizations have started investigating new therapeutics and  repurposing approved drugs so as to find fast and affordable treatments against  this disease. The present communication is aimed at highlighting the efforts that  are currently underway to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, with details on  the science, clinical status, and timeline for selected investigational drugs and  vaccines. This article is going to be of immense help to the scientific community  and researchers as it brings forth all the necessary clinical information of the  most-talked-about therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. All the details pertaining to  the clinical status of each therapeutic candidate have been updated as of June  12, 2020.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, high consumption of antivirals, antibiotics, antiparasitics, antiprotozoals, and glucocorticoids used in the treatment of this  virus has been reported. Conventional treatment systems fail to efficiently  remove these contaminants from water, becoming an emerging concern from the  environmental field. Therefore, the objective of the present work is to address  the current state of the literature on the presence and removal processes of  these drugs from water bodies. It was found that the concentration of most of the  drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 increased during the pandemic in water  bodies. Before the pandemic, Azithromycin concentrations in surface waters were  reported to be in the order of 4.3 ng L(-1), and during the pandemic, they  increased up to 935 ng L(-1). Laboratory scale studies conclude that adsorption  and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can be effective in the removal of these  drugs. Up to more than 80% removal of Azithromycin, Chloroquine, Ivermectin, and  Dexamethasone in aqueous solutions have been reported using these processes.  Pilot-scale tests achieved 100% removal of Azithromycin from hospital wastewater  by adsorption with powdered activated carbon. At full scale, treatment plants  supplemented with ozonation and artificial wetlands removed all Favipiravir and  Azithromycin, respectively. It should be noted that hybrid technologies can  improve removal rates, process kinetics, and treatment cost. Consequently, the  development of new materials that can act synergistically in technically and  economically sustainable treatments is required.

AB  - The novel SARS-CoV-2 is a new disease that has caused severe destruction to human lives across the globe, including infection, mortality and financial crises, for  which, scientific researchers have been directed towards the development of  treatment and controlling measures against coronavirus. Currently, there has been  no approved drug for the treatment of the disease, but several antiviral drugs  have shown therapeutic effects from which, remdesivir and favipiravir are two  such drugs. These drugs have shown some therapeutic potential in the treatment of  COVID-19 by inhibiting viral enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The purpose of  this systematic review is to provide an overview of the effectiveness of these  two drugs based on the clinical trials reported in current published data.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aims to evaluate changes in hematological parameters after the follow-up of patients who received treatment with favipiravir due to  COVID-19 infections. METHODS: Sixty-two cases receiving favipiravir treatment for  at least five days due to COVID-19 infection were evaluated retrospectively.  Parameters including age, gender, nasopharyngeal swab positivity, and chronic  diseases were analyzed. Hematologic parameters were analyzed before and after the  treatment. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients receiving treatment with  favipiravir was 63.7±12.3 years. Nasopharyngeal swab positivity was detected in  67.7%. The most common comorbid conditions detected in patients were hypertension  in 25 cases (40.3%) and diabetes in 16 cases (25.8%). In the statistical analysis  of the hematological parameters before and after treatment with favipiravir, WBC,  PT-PTT-INR levels were found to be unaffected; the mean RBC was found to have  decreased from 4.33 ± 0.58 M/uL to 4.16 ± 0.54 M/uL (p:0.003); the median  hemoglobin level was found to have decreased from 12.3 g/dl to 11.9 g/dl  (p:0.041); the hematocrit level decreased from 38.1% ± 4.8 to 36.9% ± 4.2  (p:0.026); the median neutrophil count decreased from 4.57 K/uL to 3.85 K/uL  (p:0.001); the mean lymphocyte count increased from 1.22 ± 0.53 K/uL to 1.84 ±  1.19 K/uL (p:0.000); and the mean platelet count increased from 244.1 ± 85.1 K/uL  to 281.9 ± 103.3 K/uL (p:0.005). CONCLUSION: We concluded that the pathological  effect of treatment with favipiravir on the hematologic system was the  suppression in the erythrocyte series, and there were no adverse effects in other  hematologic parameters.

AB  - The antiretroviral drug favipiravir (FPV) inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It has been developed for the treatment of the novel coronavirus (severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection disease, coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19). However, its pharmacokinetics in patients with COVID-19 is poorly  understood. In this study, we measured FPV serum concentration by liquid  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and conducted population pharmacokinetic  analysis. A total of 39 patients were enrolled in the study: 33 were administered  FPV 1600 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) on the first day followed by 600 mg b.i.d., and  6 were administered FPV 1800 mg b.i.d. on the first day followed by 800 mg or  600 mg b.i.d. The median age was 68 years (range, 27-89 years), 31 (79.5%)  patients were men, median body surface area (BSA) was 1.72 m(2) (range, 1.11-2.2  m(2) ), and 10 (25.6%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at  the start of FPV. A total of 204 serum concentrations were available for  pharmacokinetic analysis. A one-compartment model with first-order elimination  was used to describe the pharmacokinetics. The estimated mean  clearance/bioavailability (CL/F) and distribution volume/bioavailability (V/F)  were 5.11 L/h and 41.6 L, respectively. Covariate analysis revealed that CL/F was  significantly related to dosage, IMV use, and BSA. A simulation study showed that  the 1600 mg/600 mg b.i.d. regimen was insufficient for the treatment of COVID-19  targeting the 50% effective concentration (9.7 µg/mL), especially in patients  with larger BSA and/or IMV. A higher FPV dosage is required for COVID-19, but  dose-dependent nonlinear pharmacokinetics may cause an unexpected significant  pharmacokinetic change and drug toxicity. Further studies are warranted to  explore the optimal FPV regimen.

AB  - The risk-benefit ratio associated with the use of repurposed drugs to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related infectious  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is complicated because benefits are awaited,  not proven. A thorough literature search was conducted to source information on  the pharmacological properties of 5 drugs and 1 combination (azithromycin,  chloroquine, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and  lopinavir/ritonavir) repurposed to treat COVID-19. A risk assessment of  drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) associated with COVID-19 repurposed drugs  was performed and compared with 23 well-known torsadogenic and 10 low  torsadogenic risk compounds. Computer calculations were performed using  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, including affinity to block the rapid  component of the delayed rectifier cardiac potassium current (I(Kr) ) encoded by  the human ether-a-go-go gene (hERG), propensity to prolong cardiac repolarization  (QT interval) and cause torsade de pointes (TdP). Seven different LQTS indices  were calculated and compared. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse  Event Reporting System (FAERS) database was queried with specific key words  relating to arrhythmogenic events. Estimators of LQTS risk levels indicated a  very high or moderate risk for all COVID-19 repurposed drugs with the exception  for azithromycin, although cases of TdP have been reported with this drug. There  was excellent agreement among the various indices used to assess risk of  drug-induced LQTS for the 6 repurposed medications and 23 torsadogenic compounds.  Based on our results, monitoring of the QT interval shall be performed when some  COVID-19 repurposed drugs are used, as such monitoring is possible for  hospitalized patients or with the use of biodevices for outpatients.

AB  - Elevation of serum hepatic enzymes are common during the course of COVID–19. There are three possible mechanisms behind this phenomenon: 1) direct and  indirect cytotoxic effects of SARS-CoV-2, 2) pharmacological side effects of  COVID–19 drugs (e.g., remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, systemic  corticosteroids, etc.) and 3) the progression of chronic hepatic diseases. Both  the differential diagnosis and the clinical decision-making may pose difficulty  for the the astute clinician, as an inappropriate treatment may result in  COVID–19 progression or liver function deterioration. This review aims to provide  basic guidance on the clinical decision-making for physicians managing patients  with COVID–19.

AB  - While the number of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases is increasing day by day, there is limited information known about the hematological and laboratory  findings of the disease. We aimed to investigate whether serum ferritin level  predicts mortality is a marker for rapid progression for inpatients. Our study  included 56 patients who were died due to COVID-19 as the study group, and 245  patients who were hospitalized and recovered as the control group. The laboratory  data of the patients were evaluated from the first blood tests (pre) taken from  the first moment of admission to the hospital and the blood tests taken from  before the patient's discharge or exitus (post) were evaluated retrospectively.  The mean age of the nonsurvivor group was 62.0 ± 15.7 and the mean age of the  control group was 54.34 ± 13.03. Age and length of stay are significantly higher  in the nonsurvivor group. When comparing the pre- and postvalues of ferritin,  according to the two groups separately, there was no significant difference in  the control group and a high level of significance was observed in the  nonsurvivor group (p < .01). COVID-19 disease caused by severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus-2 causes high mortality with widespread inflammation and  cytokine storm. Ferritin is a cheap and widespread available marker, ferritin,  which can be used for its predictivity of the mortality and hope it would be a  useful marker for clinicians for the management of the disease.

AB  - Non-Structural Protein 16 (nsp-16), a viral RNA methyltransferase (MTase), is one of the highly viable targets for drug discovery of coronaviruses including  SARS-CoV-2. In this study, drug discovery of SARS-CoV-2 nsp-16 has been performed  by a virtual drug repurposing approach. First, drug shape-based screening (among  FDA approved drugs) with a known template of MTase inhibitor, sinefungin was done  and best compounds with high similarity scores were selected. In addition to the  selected compounds, 4 nucleoside analogs of anti-viral (Raltgravir, Maraviroc and  Favipiravir) and anti-inflammatory (Prednisolone) drugs were selected for further  investigations. Then, binding energies and interaction modes were found by  molecular docking approaches and compouds with lower energy were selected for  further investigation. After that, Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried  to test the potential selected compounds in a realistic environment. The results  showed that Raltegravir and Maraviroc among other compounds can bind strongly to  the active site of the protein compared to sinefungin, and can be potential  candidates to inhibit NSP-16. Also, the MD simulation results suggested that the  Maraviroc and Raltegravir are more effective drug candidates than Sinefungin for  inhibiting the enzyme. It is concluded that Raltegravir and Maraviroc which may  be used in the treatment of COVID-19 after Invitro and invivo studies and  clinical trial for final confirmation of drug effectiveness.

TI  - Cyanorona-20: The first potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent.
AU  - Rabie, Amgad M.
T2  - International immunopharmacology
AB  - Explicit hindrance and blockade of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered one of the most promising and efficient approaches  for developing highly potent remedies for COVID-19. However, almost all of the  reported viral RdRp inhibitors (either repurposed or new antiviral drugs) lack  specific selectivity against the novel coronaviral RdRp and still at a beginning  phase of advancement. Herein, I discovered and introduce a new pyrazine  derivative, (E)-N-(4-cyanobenzylidene)-6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide  (cyanorona-20), as the first potent SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor with very high  selectivity (209- and 45-fold more potent than favipiravir and remdesivir,  respectively). This promising selective specific anti-COVID-19 compound is also  deemed to be the first distinctive derivative of favipiravir. Cyanorona-20, the  unprecedented nucleoside/nucleotide analog, was designed, synthesized,  characterized, computationally studied, and biologically evaluated for its  anti-COVID-19 actions (through a precise in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay). The  results of the biological assay displayed that cyanorona-20 surprisingly  exhibited very high and largely significant anti-COVID-19 activities  (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC(50) = 0.45 μM), and, in addition, it could be also a very  promising guide and lead compound for the design and synthesis of new  anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-COVID-19 agents through structural modifications and  further computational studies. Further appraisal for the improvement of  cyanorona-20 medication is a prerequisite requirement in the coming days. In a  word, the ascent of the second member (cyanorona-20 "Corona Antidote") of the  novel and promising class of anti-COVID-19 pyrazine derivatives would drastically  make a medical uprising in the pharmacotherapeutic treatment regimens and  protocols of the recently-emerged SARS-CoV-2 infection and its accompanying  COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) induced Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has currently become pandemic  worldwide. Though drugs like remdesivir, favipiravir, and dexamethasone found  beneficial for COVID-19 management, they have limitations clinically, and vaccine  development takes a long time. The researchers have reported key proteins which  could act as druggable targets. Among them, the major protease M(pro) is first  published, plays a prominent role in viral replication and an attractive  drug-target for drug discovery. Hence, to target M(pro) and inhibit it, we  accomplished the virtual screening of US-FDA approved drugs using well-known drug  repurposing approach by computer-aided tools. METHODS: The protein M(pro), PDB-ID  6LU7 was imported to Maestro graphical user interphase of Schrödinger software.  The US-FDA approved drug structures are imported from DrugBank and docked after  preliminary protein and ligand preparation. The drugs are shortlisted based on  the docking scores in the Standard Precision method (SP-docking) and then based  on the type of molecular interactions they are studied for molecular dynamics  simulations. RESULTS: The docking and molecular interactions studies, five drugs  emerged as potential hits by forming hydrophilic, hydrophobic, electrostatic  interactions. The drugs such as arbutin, terbutaline, barnidipine, tipiracil and  aprepitant identified as potential hits. Among the drugs, tipiracil and  aprepitant interacted with the M(pro) consistently, and they turned out to be  most promising. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the possible exploration for drug  repurposing using computer-aided docking tools and the potential roles of  tipiracil and aprepitant, which can be explored further in the treatment of  COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Due to the importance of early outpatient treatment to prevent hospitalization and disease progression, we examined the effects of  hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir, which were initiated in early period, on the  clinical course of COVID-19 outpatients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of confirmed  COVID-19 outpatients over a 4-month period were analyzed retrospectively. Public  Health Management System (HSYS) was used for the case-based follow-up. Patients  on antiviral therapy for at least five days, including hydroxychloroquine and /  or favipiravir and patients who were followed-up for 30 days were included in  this analysis. RESULTS: We enrolled 1489 patients in this study. Overall, 775  (52%) patients were male and a mean age of patients was 38.9 ± 11.1 years. Of  these patients, 537 of them were received favipiravir, 545 of them were received  hydroxychloroquine and 407 of them were received both favipiravir and  hydroxychloroquine. Symptoms improvement on the 14th day of follow-up was 1.8  times higher in the group of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine compared to  patients who received favipiravir (p = 0.003). On the 3rd day of follow- up, PCR  negativity rate was higher in patients who received hydroxychloroquine (p =  0.004). Hospitalization rates were similar in patients receiving favipiravir and  hydroxychloroquine (p = 0.144). However, in the presence of pneumonia at the time  of diagnosis, the hospitalization rate was 6.6 times higher in patients who  received favipiravir than those who received hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: The  subgroups of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and/or favipiravir did not  have similar disease severities in our study. Therefore, further studies with  homogeneous patient groups to be arranged prospectively are needed.

AB  - The present work aimed to develop an optimized liposomal formulation for enhancing the anti-viral activity of propolis against COVID-19. Docking studies  were performed for certain components of Egyptian Propolis using Avigan,  Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir as standard antivirals against both COVID-19  3CL-protease and S1 spike protein. Response surface methodology and modified  injection method were implemented to maximize the entrapment efficiency and  release of the liposomal formulation. The optimized formulation parameters were  as follow: LMC of 60 mM, CH% of 20% and DL of 5 mg/ml. At those values the E.E%  and released % were 70.112% and 81.801%, respectively with nanosized particles  (117 ± 11 nm). Docking studies revealed that Rutin and Caffeic acid phenethyl  ester showed the highest affinity to both targets. Results showed a significant  inhibitory effect of the optimized liposomal formula of Propolis against  COVID-3CL protease (IC50 = 1.183 ± 0.06) compared with the Egyptian propolis  extract (IC50 = 2.452 ± 0.11), P < 0.001. Interestingly, the inhibition of viral  replication of COVID-19 determined by RT_PCR has been significantly enhanced via  encapsulation of propolis extract within the liposomal formulation (P < 0.0001)  and was comparable to the viral inhibitory effect of the potent antiviral  (remdesivir). These findings identified the potential of propolis liposomes as a  promising treatment approach against COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several clinical studies have reported the efficacy of favipiravir in reducing viral load and shortening the duration of symptoms. However, the  viability of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of favipiravir therapy and the potential  for resistance development is unclear. METHODS: We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 in  nasopharyngeal specimens collected from patients who participated in a randomized  clinical trial of favipiravir at hospitals across Japan between March and May  2020. Paired genomes were sequenced from those who remained RT-PCR-positive 5-8  days into favipiravir therapy. Daily nasopharyngeal specimens from 69 patients  who were RT-PCR-positive at randomization were examined for a cytopathic effect  (CPE). RESULTS: Some strains early in the trial belonged to clade 19 B, whereas  the majority belonged to clade 20 B. The median time from the disease onset to  negative CPE was 9 days. CPE was strongly correlated with the time from disease  onset, viral load, age, and male sex. Among 23 patients for whom paired genomes  were available, all except one had identical genomes. Two mutations were observed  in one patient who received favipiravir, neither in the RdRp gene. CONCLUSIONS:  The SARS-CoV-2 genome distribution in this clinical trial conducted in Japan  reflected the early influx of strains from China followed by replacement by  strains from Europe. CPE was significantly associated with age, male sex, and  viral loads but not with favipiravir therapy. There was no evidence of resistance  development during favipiravir therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Favipiravir has shown promising results for COVID-19 globally. Though many Indian patients have received favipiravir, there is a lack of  realworld data for its clinical use by the practicing physicians. Hence, a  qualitative survey was conducted to understand real-world use of favipiravir in  management of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based, qualitative survey  was conducted between September 2020 to October 2020, among Indian physicians  from various specialties involved in COVID-19 care and using favipiravir in their  practice. Physicians were provided survey link having a structured questionnaire  with 32 questions. They were enquired on- 1) demographics,practice information,  2) place of favipiravir in clinical practice, 3) treatment protocol for mild to  moderate COVID-19, 4) dosage and duration of favipiravir, 5) effectiveness of  favipiravir, 6) tolerability of favipiravir 7) global efficacy and safety  assessment of favipiravir. RESULTS: A total of 500 physicians were contacted, of  which 50 physicians completed the questionnaire. 25(50.0%) were from south zone  followed by 12(24.0%) from west. . Majority physicians (47, 97.9%) stated that  favipiravir was used for COVID-19 in outpatient setting. Favipiravir was  considered as the current drug of choice for ' mild COVID-19 with fever(86.6%).  All physicians agreed that favipiravir was being used as per the recommended  dose.. A total of 75% & 62.5% physicians agreed to observed clinical improvement  by around 3-5 days & 5-7 days in symptomatic mild & moderate COVID-19  respectively. CONCLUSION: Majority of the physicians considered favipiravir to be  safe and effective in treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19.

AB  - After the outbreak of COVID-19, many novel drugs have been introduced to improve patients' conditions. Remdesivir and Favipiravir are among the most common drugs  used against SARS-CoV-2. Although promising, cardiovascular side effects of these  drugs should be considered by physicians and nurses. In this study, we searched  databases for assessing the cardiovascular side effects of Remdesivir and  Favipiravir. It seems that despite the beneficial effects of these drugs, due to  the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 and cardiovascular side effects of  these drugs, which can overlap with each other, the use of these drugs can be a  challenging issue in the cardiovascular practice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging the management of cancer patients. In this article, we present two patients diagnosed with  anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) + non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCL CA),  infected with COVID-19, who had a previous multi-line therapy with Brigatinib and  Lorlatinib, and received Favipiravir for their current infection. CASE REPORTS: A  58-year-old man and a 65-year-old woman were diagnosed as ALK ( + ) NSCL CA. Both  patients received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for lung cancer when diagnosed  with COVID-19. No adverse effects were observed with the concurrent use of  Favipiravir, an antiviral drug currently used for COVID-19 and TKI. MANAGEMENT  AND OUTCOME: Considering the pharmacokinetic effects of favipiravir and the ALK  inhibitor TKI's used on our cases (Brigatinib-Lorlatinib), the concurrent use of  these drugs was safe and prevented the delay in the primary treatment of the  malignancy of our patients. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, these are the only  reported cases diagnosed as ALK ( + ) NSCL CA who received favipiravir because of  COVID-19 while using TKI, and both patients recovered completely without any side  effects.

TI  - Favipiravir exposure and pregnancy outcome of COVID-19 patients.
AU  - Tırmıkçıoğlu, Zeynep
T2  - European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology
AB  - OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading disease and many people have been infected in a short time. Favipiravir is under investigation for the treatment of  COVID-19 and given to patients in many countries following emergency use  approval. Based on data from animal studies, favipiravir use is contraindicated  during pregnancy. Currently, there is no human data except for a single case  report on use of favipiravir in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This article includes  the outcomes of 29 pregnancies reported to the Clinical Pharmacology and  Toxicology Unit regarding favipiravir use in pregnancy. For drug risk assessment,  maternal characteristics were obtained at first contact. After the expected day  of delivery, follow-up is conducted by phone call and all relevant data regarding  pregnancy and newborn outcome were documented. RESULTS: Of the 29 pregnancies  exposed to favipiravir, 5 were electively terminated and 24 resulted in live  birth. There were no miscarriages or no stillbirths. There were 25 live births  including one pair of twins. Three children were born premature, and one infant  had patent foramen ovale. Birth weights, lengths and head circumferences of all  infants were within normal range. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate  that favipiravir is unlikely to be a major human teratogen, but experience is  still limited for a well-grounded risk assessment. Although these findings may be  useful for the physicians and patients, larger studies are needed due to small  number of cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic remains an immediate and present concern, yet as of now there is still no approved therapeutic available for the treatment of  COVID-19.This study aimed to investigate and report evidence concerning  demographic characteristics and currently-used medications that contribute to the  ultimate outcomes of COVID-19 ICU patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study  was conducted among all COVID-19 patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of  Asir Central Hospital in Saudi Arabia between the 1st and 30th of June 2020. Data  extracted from patients' medical records included their demographics, home  medications, medications used to treat COVID-19, treatment durations, ICU stay,  hospital stay, and ultimate outcome (recovery or death).Descriptive statistics  and regression modelling were used to analyze and compare the results. The study  was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees at both Asir Central Hospital  and King Khalid University. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients with median age of  57 years having definite clinical and disease outcomes were included in the  study. Male patients accounted for 87% of the study population, and more than 65%  experienced at least one comorbidity. The mean hospital and ICU stay was 11.4 and  9.8 days, respectively. The most common drugs used were tocilizumab (31.4%),  triple combination therapy (45.8%), favipiravir (56.8%), dexamethasone (86.7%),  and enoxaparin (83%). Treatment with enoxaparin significantly reduced the length  of ICU stay (p = 0.04) and was found to be associated with mortality reduction in  patients aged 50-75 (p = 0.03), whereas the triple regimen therapy and  tocilizumab significantly increased the length of ICU stay in all patients (p =  0.01, p = 0.02 respectively). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 tends to affect males more  significantly than females. The use of enoxaparin is an important part of  COVID-19 treatment, especially for those above 50 years of age, while the use of  triple combination therapy and tocilizumab in COVID-19 protocols should be  reevaluated and restricted to patients who have high likelihood of benefit.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of minocycline (MIN) and favipiravir combination therapy in patients with coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19) admitted to our hospital in Fukui Prefecture, Japan, in March and  April of 2020. In this retrospective study, a favipiravir monotherapy group  (Control group, n = 9) was compared with a combined favipiravir plus MIN therapy  group (MIN group, n = 12). No severe cases were present. The primary comparative  endpoints evaluated were duration of fever, duration of hospitalization, duration  from treatment initiation to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative results, and changes in cytokine and  chemokine production. Median duration from start of treatment to negative PCR  test was significantly shorter in the MIN group than in the Control group. Mean  rates of cytokine and chemokine reduction were significantly greater for  interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in the MIN group. No difference in adverse event  rates were seen between groups, and only minor adverse events were encountered.  MIN has been reported to have not only broad antibacterial activity, but also  antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. The present results support the  efficacy and safety of MIN plus favipiravir therapy for the treatment of  COVID-19.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of early antiviral treatment in preventing clinical deterioration in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected (COVID-19) patients in home  isolation and to share our experiences with the ambulatory management of  nonsevere COVID-19 patients. This retrospective study included mild COVID-19  adult patients confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain  reaction. They received care via an ambulatory management strategy between July  2021 and November 2021. Demographic data, clinical progression, and outcomes were  collected. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were performed to  illustrate the cohort's characteristic and outcomes of the study. Univariable and  multivariable logistic regression models were employed to investigate the  associations between clinical factors and disease progression. A total of 1940  patients in the Siriraj home isolation system met the inclusion criteria. Their  mean age was 42.1 ± 14.9 years, with 14.2% older than 60 years, 54.3% female, and  7.1% with a body weight ≥ 90 kg. Only 115 patients (5.9%) had deterioration of  clinical symptoms. Two-thirds of these could be managed at home by dexamethasone  treatment under physician supervision; however, 38 of the 115 patients (2.0% of  the study cohort) needed hospitalization. Early favipiravir outpatient treatment  (≤ 5 days from onset of symptoms) in nonsevere COVID-19 patients was  significantly associated with a lower rate of symptom deterioration than late  favipiravir treatment (50 [4.6%] vs 65 [7.5%] patients, respectively; P = .008;  odds ratio 1.669; 95% confidence interval, 1.141-2.441). The unfavorable  prognostic factors for symptom deterioration were advanced age, body  weight ≥ 90 kg, unvaccinated status, higher reverse transcription-polymerase  chain reaction cycle threshold, and late favipiravir treatment. The early  delivery of essential treatment, including antiviral and supervisory  dexamethasone, to ambulatory nonsevere COVID-19 patients yielded favorable  outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this trial is to assess whether early antiviral therapy in outpatients with COVID-19 with either favipiravir plus  lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir alone, or favipiravir alone, is  associated with a decrease in viral load of SARS-CoV-2 compared with placebo.  TRIAL DESIGN: FLARE is a phase IIA randomised, double-blind, 2x2 factorial  placebo-controlled, interventional trial. PARTICIPANTS: This trial is being  conducted in the United Kingdom, with Royal Free Hospital, London as the lead  site. Participants are non-hospitalised adults with highly suspected COVID-19  within the first 5 days of symptom onset, or who have tested positive with  SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 within the first 7 days of symptom onset, or who are  asymptomatic but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for the first time within the  last 48 hours. Inclusion criteria are as follows: 1. Any adult with the  following: Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 disease (Fever >37.8°C on at least  one occasion AND either cough and/ or anosmia) within the first 5 days of symptom  onset (date/time of enrolment must be within the first 5 days of symptom onset)  OR ANY symptoms compatible with COVID-19 disease (may include, but are not  limited to fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise, myalgia, headache, coryza)  and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the first 7 days of symptom onset)  (date/time of enrolment must be within the first 7 days of symptom onset) OR no  symptoms but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the last 48 hours (date/time  of test must be within 48 hours of enrolment) 2. Male or female aged 18 years to  70 years old inclusive at screening 3. Willing and able to take daily saliva  samples 4. Able to provide full informed consent and willing to comply with  trial-related procedures Exclusion criteria are as follows: 1. Known  hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients or excipients in favipiravir  and matched placebo, and in lopinavir/ritonavir and matched placebo (See Appendix  2) 2. Chronic liver disease at screening (known cirrhosis of any aetiology,  chronic hepatitis (e.g. autoimmune, viral, steatohepatitis), cholangitis or any  known elevation of liver aminotransferases with AST or ALT > 3 X ULN)* 3. Chronic  kidney disease (stage 3 or beyond) at screening: eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m(2) * 4.  HIV infection, if untreated, detectable viral load or on protease inhibitor  therapy 5. Any clinical condition which the investigator considers would make the  participant unsuitable for the trial 6. Concomitant medications known to interact  with favipiravir and matched placebo, and with lopinavir/ritonavir and matched  placebo, and carry risk of toxicity for the participant 7. Current severe illness  requiring hospitalisation 8. Pregnancy and/ or breastfeeding 9. Eligible female  participants of childbearing potential and male participants with a partner of  childbearing potential not willing to use highly effective contraceptive measures  during the trial and within the time point specified following last trial  treatment dose. 10. Participants enrolled in any other interventional drug or  vaccine trial (co-enrolment in observational studies is acceptable) 11.  Participants who have received the COVID-19 vaccine *Considering the importance  of early treatment of COVID-19 to impact viral load, the absence of known chronic  liver/ kidney disease will be confirmed verbally by the participant during  pre-screening and Screening/Baseline visit. Safety blood samples will be  collected at Screening/Baseline visit (Day 1) and test results will be examined  as soon as they become available and within 24 hours.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The aim of this descriptive article is to share the experience in Ege University, Turkey with favipiravir in the treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2  pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study included  patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who presented with or developed severe  pneumonia. RESULTS: Forty patients who completed a full course (at least 5 days)  of favipiravir were included in the study. At baseline, 30 (75%) patients  required treatment for respiratory distress. Thirty-three patients (82.5%) were  discharged from the hospital with full recovery, 6 patients (15%) died and 1 case  (2.5%) was still at the intensive care unit (ICU) when this paper was written.  CONCLUSION: This study provides relevant information for the treatment of  COVID-19, suggesting that favipiravir was associated with significant clinical  and laboratory improvements in the majority of the patients, is a safe drug with  no serious side effects and would merit further investigation.

AB  - A novel coronavirus, SARS- CoV-2 (2019-nCoV), emerged in December 2019 as an immediate global challenge. Comprehensive efforts at the present time are focused  simultaneously on containing the spread of this virus and extenuating the ill  effects. There is an immediate need for drugs that can help before a vaccine can  be developed. Researchers are endeavoring to find antiviral therapies specific to  the virus. As the condition is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and  development of new drugs is a long process, and is unfeasible to face the  immediate global challenge. Strategy to reposition the previously used drugs can  prove to be effective to combat this difficult to treat pandemic. Several drugs  such as Hydroxychloroquine, Umifenovir, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ Ritonavir,  interferon, Darunavir, Favipiravir, Nitazoxanide, etc. are currently undergoing  clinical studies to test the safety and efficacy of the drug against this  pandemic. The present review gives a snapshot look at the current clinical  experience with repurposed antiviral drugs.

AU  - Pamukçu, Burak
T2  - Anatolian journal of cardiology
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2' (SARS-CoV-2) infection emerged in Wuhan, a city of China, and  spread to the entire planet in early 2020. The virus enters the respiratory tract  cells and other tissues via ACE2 receptors. Approximately 20% of infected  subjects develop severe or critical disease. A cytokine storm leads to over  inflammation and thrombotic events. The most common clinical presentation in  COVID-19 is pneumonia, typically characterized by bilateral, peripheral, and  patchy infiltrations in the lungs. However multi-systemic involvement including  peripheral thromboembolic skin lesions, central nervous, gastrointestinal,  circulatory, and urinary systems are reported. The disease has a higher mortality  compared to other viral agents causing pneumonia and unfortunately, no approved  specific therapy, nor vaccine has yet been discovered. Several clinical trials  are ongoing with hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, and low molecular  weight heparins. This comprehensive review aimed to summarize coagulation  abnormalities reported in COVID-19, discuss the thrombosis, and  inflammation-driven background of the disease, emphasize the impact of thrombotic  and inflammatory processes on the progression and prognosis of COVID-19, and to  provide evidence-based therapeutic guidance, especially from antithrombotic and  anti-inflammatory perspectives.

AB  - Favipiravir finished dosage was approved for emergency use in many countries to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients. A specific, accurate, linear, robust, simple, and  stability-indicating HPLC method was developed and validated for the  determination of degradation impurities present in favipiravir film-coated  tablets. The separation of all impurities was achieved from the stationary phase  (Inert sustain AQ-C18, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle) and mobile phase. Mobile  phase A contained KH(2) PO(4) buffer (pH 2.5 ± 0.05) and acetonitrile in the  ratio of 98:2 (v/v), and mobile phase B contained water and acetonitrile in the  ratio of 50:50 (v/v). The chromatographic conditions were optimized as follows:  flow rate, 0.7 mL/min; UV detection, 210 nm; injection volume, 20 μL; and column  temperature, 33°C. The proposed method was validated per the current  International Conference on Harmonization Q2 (R1) guidelines. The recovery study  and linearity ranges were established from the limit of quantification to 150%  optimal concentrations. The method validation results were found to be between  98.6 and 106.2% for recovery and r(2)  = 0.9995-0.9999 for linearity of all  identified impurities. The method precision results were achieved below 5% of  relative standard deviation. Forced degradation studies were performed in  chemical and physical stress conditions. The compound was sensitive to chemical  stress conditions. During the study, the analyte degraded and converted to  unknown degradation impurities, and its molecular mass was found using the LC-MS  technique and established degradation pathways supported by reaction of  mechanism. The developed method was found to be suitable for routine analysis of  research and development and quality control.

AB  - COVID-19 respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global health issue since it  emerged in December 2019. While great global efforts are underway to develop  vaccines and to discover or repurpose therapeutic agents for this disease, as of  this writing only the nucleoside drug remdesivir has been approved under  Emergency Use Authorization to treat COVID-19. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  (RdRP), a viral enzyme for viral RNA replication in host cells, is one of the  most intriguing and promising drug targets for SARS-CoV-2 drug development.  Because RdRP is a viral enzyme with no host cell homologs, selective SARS-CoV-2  RdRP inhibitors can be developed that have improved potency and fewer off-target  effects against human host proteins and thus are safer and more effective  therapeutics for treating COVID-19. This review focuses on biochemical enzyme and  cell-based assays for RdRPs that could be used in high-throughput screening to  discover new and repurposed drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - PURPOSE: The development of effective treatments for coronavirus infectious disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Coronavirus-2 was hindered by the little  data available about this virus at the start of the pandemic. Drug repurposing  provides a good strategy to explore approved drugs' possible SARS-CoV-2 antiviral  activity. Moreover, drug synergism is essential in antiviral treatment due to  improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. In this work, we studied the effect of  approved and investigational drugs on one of SARS-CoV-2 essential proteins, the  main protease (M(pro)), in search of antiviral treatments and/or drug  combinations. METHODS: Different possible druggable sites of M(pro) were  identified and screened against an in-house library of more than 4000 chemical  compounds. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to explore  conformational changes induced by different ligands' binding. Subsequently, the  inhibitory effect of the identified compounds and the suggested drug combinations  on the M(pro) were established using a 3CL protease (SARS-CoV-2) assay kit.  RESULTS: Three potential inhibitors in three different binding sites were  identified; favipiravir, cefixime, and carvedilol. Molecular dynamics simulations  predicted the synergistic effect of two drug combinations: favipiravir/cefixime,  and favipiravir/carvedilol. The in vitro inhibitory effect of the predicted drug  combinations was established on this enzyme. CONCLUSION: In this work, we could  study one of the promising SARS-CoV-2 viral protein targets in searching for  treatments for COVID-19. The inhibitory effect of several drugs on M(pro) was  established in silico and in vitro assays. Molecular dynamics simulations showed  promising results in predicting the synergistic effect of drug combinations.

AB  - PURPOSE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted primarily via respiratory droplets and enters host cells through  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors. ACE-2 receptors have been  identified in many tissues including testes. The aim of the study has been to  investigate the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and its  relative treatment on male reproductive health. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis  has been performed on 49 recovered COVID-19 patients who had semen analysis prior  to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who had a recovery time lag of at least 3 months  have been re-examined, and 29 eligible patients with no andrological problems  have been enrolled in the study. Following a detailed physical examination and  retrieval of medical history, the values of semen analysis and serum sex hormone  parameters have been collected and compared before and after COVID-19 infection.  The p value of <0.05 has been considered significant. RESULTS: The average age of  the 29 patients has been 31.21 ± 5.48 (range: 18-41) years. Favipiravir has been  co-administered with hydroxychloroquine in 17 patients, while the remaining 12  received favipiravir treatment without hydroxychloroquine. The average time  between clinical recovery from COVID-19 and collection of semen has been 4.52 ±  1.36 (range: 3-8) months. Before and after COVID-19, serum follicle-stimulating  hormone, luteinizing hormone, total testosterone, and prolactin levels, as well  as all semen parameters, have been comparable. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated  that COVID-19 and its treatment with favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine did not  affect spermatogenesis and serum androgen levels in the long-term period. Further  clinical studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm and support our  findings.

AB  - The pandemic outbreak of a new coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV-2, has captured the world's attention, demonstrating that CoVs represent a continuous global threat.  As this is a highly contagious virus, it is imperative to understand  RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), the key component in virus replication.  Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome shares 80% sequence identity with severe acute  respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV, their RdRps and nucleotidyl-transferases (NiRAN)  share 98.1% and 93.2% identity, respectively. Sequence alignment of six  coronaviruses demonstrated higher identity among their RdRps (60.9%-98.1%) and  lower identity among their Spike proteins (27%-77%). Thus, a 3D structural model  of RdRp, NiRAN, non-structural protein 7 (nsp7), and nsp8 of SARS-CoV-2 was  generated by modeling starting from the SARS counterpart structures. Furthermore,  we demonstrate the binding poses of three viral RdRp inhibitors (Galidesivir,  Favipiravir, and Penciclovir), which were recently reported to have clinical  significance for SARS-CoV-2. The network of interactions established by these  drug molecules affirms their efficacy to inhibit viral RNA replication and  provides an insight into their structure-based rational optimization for  SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.

AB  - The sudden outbreak of a novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China, that rapidly provoked a global concern, marked as the third attack of corona virus in the  human society that affected the global healthcare system as well as the global  economy. Until and unless an effective vaccine is discovered against the virus,  the pharmacological intervention by different antivirals is in the run for  remedy. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the role of favipiravir  along with its safety and efficacy for the patients who are suffering from severe  acute respiratory distress syndrome due to CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as  re-purposeful use. We searched PubMed, EMBASE for randomized controlled trials  (RCTs), cilicaltrial.com for registered on going trails to evaluate the pros and  cons of using favipiravir in COVID-19. After vigorous searching, screening and  sorting of 314 articles for completed and published scientific evidences in  electronic database, there were only 2 completed and published randomized control  trials (RCT) and 17 ongoing or unpublished trials found until June 2020. The main  outcome measures were viral clearance, clinical improvement and adverse events  reported and published on 147 patients infected with SARS-CoV2. The 2 completed  RCTs showed significantly better treatment effects on disease progression, viral  clearance, improved the latency to relief for pyrexia and cough on favipiravir  treated patients. Adverse effects caused Favipiravir are mild and manageable.  Although 9 more RCTs and cohort studies are supposed to be completed by this time  that may unveil some evidence for use of anti-RNA-viral drug favipiravir against  influenza or Ebola to re-purposing against COVID-19 as adopted in different  treatment guidelines.

T2  - Viruses
AB  - In RNA viruses, a small increase in their mutation rates can be sufficient to exceed their threshold of viability. Lethal mutagenesis is a therapeutic strategy  based on the use of mutagens, driving viral populations to extinction. Extinction  catastrophe can be experimentally induced by promutagenic nucleosides in cell  culture models. The loss of HIV infectivity has been observed after passage in  5-hydroxydeoxycytidine or 5,6-dihydro-5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine while producing a  two-fold increase in the viral mutation frequency. Among approved nucleoside  analogs, experiments with polioviruses and other RNA viruses suggested that  ribavirin can be mutagenic, although its mechanism of action is not clear.  Favipiravir and molnupiravir exert an antiviral effect through lethal  mutagenesis. Both drugs are broad-spectrum antiviral agents active against RNA  viruses. Favipiravir incorporates into viral RNA, affecting the G→A and C→U  transition rates. Molnupiravir (a prodrug of β-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine) has been  recently approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Its triphosphate  derivative can be incorporated into viral RNA and extended by the coronavirus RNA  polymerase. Incorrect base pairing and inefficient extension by the polymerase  promote mutagenesis by increasing the G→A and C→U transition frequencies. Despite  having remarkable antiviral action and resilience to drug resistance,  carcinogenic risks and genotoxicity are important concerns limiting their  extended use in antiviral therapy.

AB  - New treatment against SARS-CoV-2 now is a must. Nowadays, the world encounters a huge health crisis by the COVID-19 viral infection. Nucleotide inhibitors gave a  lot of promising results in terms of its efficacy against different viral  infections. In this work, molecular modeling, docking, and dynamics simulations  are used to build a model for the viral protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  (RdRp) and test its binding affinity to some clinically approved drugs and drug  candidates. Molecular dynamics is used to equilibrate the system upon binding  calculations to ensure the successful reproduction of previous results, to  include the dynamics of the RdRp, and to understand how it affects the binding.  The results show the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Galidesivir,  Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Cefuroxime, Tenofovir, and Hydroxychloroquine, in  binding to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Additionally, Setrobuvir, YAK, and IDX-184, show  better results, while four novel IDX-184 derivatives show promising results in  attaching to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. There is an urgent need to specify drugs that  can selectively bind and subsequently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The  availability of a punch of FDA-approved anti-viral drugs can help us in this  mission, aiming to reduce the danger of COVID-19. The compounds 2 and 3 may  tightly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and so may be successful in the treatment of  COVID-19.

The antiviral  treatment acts as one of the most important means of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Alteration of physiological characteristics in special populations may lead to  the change in drug pharmacokinetics, which may result in treatment failure or  increased adverse drug reactions. Some potential drugs have shown antiviral  effects on SARS-CoV-2 infections, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine,  favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, interferon alpha, and remedsivir.  Here, we reviewed the literature on clinical effects in COVID-19 patients of  these antiviral agents and provided the potential antiviral agent options for  pregnant women, elderly patients, liver or renal dysfunction patients, and severe  or critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy or ECMO after  SARS-CoV-2 infection.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the children with COVID-19. METHOD: We conducted a  retrospective review of the medical records of pediatric patients on March 11 and  May 23, 2020. RESULTS: We evaluated 77 COVID-19 pediatric patients, of whom 45.5%  were male, with a median age of 8 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2-13), and  6.4% had underlying diseases. Patients were classified according to severity,  with the percentages of asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and critical/severe cases  determined to be 24.7%, 41.6%, 29.9%, and 3.9%, respectively. Extracorporeal  membrane oxygenation and mechanic ventilation were only required for 1 patient.  Targeted therapies were used in 3 patients. CONCLUSION: The disease course of  COVID-19 appears to be milder in children than in adults, and the treatment  course primarily consists of supportive care.

AB  - Despite aggressive efforts on containment measures for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic around the world, severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuously spreading. Therefore, there is an  urgent need for an effective antiviral agent. To date, considerable research has  been conducted to develop different approaches to COVID-19 therapy. In addition  to early observational studies, which could be limited by study design, small  sample size, non-randomized design, or different timings of treatment, an  increasing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the  clinical efficacy and safety of antiviral agents are being carried out. This  study reviews the updated findings of RCTs regarding the clinical efficacy of  eight antiviral agents against COVID-19, including remdesivir,  lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir,  baloxavir, umifenovir, darunavir/cobicistat, and their combinations. Treatment  with remdesivir could accelerate clinical improvement; however, it lacked  additional survival benefits. Moreover, 5-day regimen of remdesivir might show  adequate effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Favipiravir  was only marginally effective regarding clinical improvement and virological  assessment based on the results of small RCTs. The present evidence suggests that  sofosbuvir/daclatasvir may improve survival and clinical outcomes in patients  with COVID-19. However, the sample sizes for analysis were relatively small, and  all studies were exclusively conducted in Iran. Further larger RCTs in other  countries are warranted to support these findings. In contrast, the present  findings of limited RCTs did not indicate the use of lopinavir/ritonavir,  sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, baloxavir, umifenovir, and darunavir/cobicistat in the  treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

AB  - Lung cancer patients are at heightened risk for developing COVID-19 infection as well as complications due to multiple risk factors such as underlying malignancy,  anti-cancer treatment induced immunosuppression, additional comorbidities and  history of smoking. Recent literatures have reported a significant proportion of  lung cancer patients coinfected with COVID-19. Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine,  lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and  umifenovir represent the major repurposed drugs used as potential experimental  agents for COVID-19 whereas azithromycin, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, sarilumab,  famotidine and ceftriaxone are some of the supporting agents that are under  investigation for COVID-19 management. The rationale of this review is to  identify potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) occurring in lung cancer  patients receiving lung cancer medications and repurposed COVID-19 drugs using  Micromedex and additional literatures. This review has identified several  potential DDIs that could occur with the concomitant treatments of COVID-19  repurposed drugs and lung cancer medications. This information may be utilized by  the healthcare professionals for screening and identifying potential DDIs with  adverse outcomes, based on their severity and documentation levels and  consequently design prophylactic and management strategies for their prevention.  Identification, reporting and management of DDIs and dissemination of related  information should be a major consideration in the delivery of lung cancer care  during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for better patient outcomes and updating  guidelines for safer prescribing practices in this coinfected condition.

AB  - Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) infection has been rapidly spreading  worldwide and causing the respiratory illness, coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19). The antiretroviral drug favipiravir (FPV) has been experimentally  used for COVID-19 treatment since March 2020 in Japan. However, the  pharmacokinetics of FPV in critically ill patients is unknown. We measured the  serum concentration of FPV using high-performance liquid chromatography in  patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit and  placed on mechanical ventilation. The patients were administered 1,600 mg of FPV  twice daily on day 1, followed by 600 mg twice daily from day 2 to day 5 (or more  if needed). Suspensions of FPV tablets were administered through a nasogastric  tube. Seven patients were enrolled in this study. Forty-nine blood samples were  obtained from the eligible patients to evaluate FPV concentration. The FPV trough  (after 8-12 hours) concentrations of most samples were lower than the lower limit  of quantification (1 µg/mL) and half-maximal effective concentration (9.7 µg/mL)  against SARS-CoV-2 previously tested in vitro. FPV trough concentration in  critically ill patients was much lower than that of healthy subjects in a  previous clinical trial, which is a cause for great concern. Further study is  required to determine the optimal strategy for treatment of patients with severe  COVID-19.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and pandemic that began near the end of 2019 has posed a challenge to global health. At present, many candidate small-molecule  therapeutics have been developed that can inhibit both the infection and  replication of SARS-CoV-2 and even potentially relieve cytokine storms and other  related complications. Meanwhile, host-targeted drugs that inhibit cellular  transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) can prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering  cells, and its combination with chloroquine and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase  (DHODH) inhibitors can limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the morbidity  and mortality of patients with COVID-19. The present article provides an overview  of these small-molecule therapeutics based on insights from medicinal chemistry  research and focuses on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors, such as  the nucleoside analogues remdesivir, favipiravir and ribavirin. This review also  covers inhibitors of 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)), papain-like protease (PL(pro))  and other potentially innovative active ingredient molecules, describing their  potential targets, activities, clinical status and side effects.

AB  - The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 created by its severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant, known for producing a  very severe acute respiratory syndrome, has created an unprecedented situation by  its continual assault around the world. The crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2  variant has been a global challenge, calling to mitigate this unprecedented  pandemic that has engulfed the whole world. Since the outbreak and spread of  COVID-19, many researchers globally have been grappling to find new clinically  trialed active drugs with anti-COVID-19 activity, from antimalarial drugs to JAK  inhibitors, antiviral drugs, immune suppressants, and so forth. This article  presents a brief discussion on the activity and synthesis of some active  molecules such as favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, pirfenidone, remdesivir,  lopinavir, camostat, chloroquine, baricitinib, molnupiravir, and so forth, which  are under trial.

AB  - We hereby introduce a sensitive fast straightforward spectrofluorometric method for the estimation of remdesivir and favipiravir. The two drugs are prescribed in  some regimens to treat COVID-19 pandemic disease, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2.  The method is based on the first derivative synchronous spectrofluorimetry  approach for the measurement of remdesivir and favipiravir. This was accomplished  at 251 nm and 335 nm respectively using the first derivative order at delta  lambda of 140 nm. A linear response with a correlation coefficient 0.9994 was  achieved between the concentration and the derivative amplitudes in the ranges of  20.0-100.0 ng ml(-1) and 40.0-100.0 ng ml(-1) for remdesivir and favipiravir,  respectively. The methods were validated for different parameters as stated by  the pharmacopeial rules and were applied successfully for estimation of the  studied drugs in their synthetic mixtures and in spiked human plasma samples. No  significant difference was observed between the proposed and comparison methods  as revealed from the analysis of data.

AB  - The flare-up in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread expeditiously worldwide has  become a health challenge globally. The rapid transmission, absence of  anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, and inexistence of vaccine are further exacerbating the  situation. Several drugs, including chloroquine, remdesivir, and favipiravir, are  presently undergoing clinical investigation to further scrutinize their  effectiveness and validity in the management of COVID-19. Natural products (NPs)  in general, and plants constituents specifically, are unique sources for various  effective and novel drugs. Immunostimulants, including vitamins, iron, zinc,  chrysin, caffeic acid, and gallic acid, act as potent weapons against COVID-19 by  reinvigorating the defensive mechanisms of the immune system. Immunity boosters  prevent COVID-19 by stimulating the proliferation of T-cells, B-cells, and  neutrophils, neutralizing the free radicals, inhibiting the immunosuppressive  agents, and promoting cytokine production. Presently, antiviral therapy includes  several lead compounds, such as baicalin, glycyrrhizin, theaflavin, and  herbacetin, all of which seem to act against SARS-CoV-2 via particular targets,  such as blocking virus entry, attachment to host cell receptor, inhibiting viral  replication, and assembly and release.

T2  - Computational biology and chemistry
AB  - The virus that causes Ebola is fatal. Although many researchers have attempted to contain this deadly infection, the fatality rate remains high. The atom-pair  fingerprint technique was used to compare drugs suggested for the treatment of  Ebola or those that are currently being tested in clinical settings.  Subsequently, using scaffold network graph (SNG) methods, the molecular and  structural scaffolds of the drugs chosen based on these similar results were  created, and the drug structures were examined. Public databases (PubChem and  DrugBank) and literature regarding Ebola treatment were used in the analysis.  Graphical representations of the molecular architecture and core structures of  the drugs with the highest similarity to Food and Drug Administration  (FDA)-approved drugs were produced using the SNG method. The combination of  molnupiravir, the first licensed oral medication candidate for COVID-19, and  favipiravir, employed in other viral outbreaks, should be further researched for  treating Ebola, as observed in our study. We also believe that chemists will  benefit from understanding the core structure(s) of medication molecules  effective against the Ebola virus, their inhibitors, and the chemical structure  similarities of existing pharmaceuticals utilized to build alternative drugs or  drug combinations.

AB  - Infection outbreak has been prevalent since previous decades. The impact of infection outbreak not merely limited to physical suffering but grounded for  massive mental health issues. The fear of getting contagion and persistent  exposure to diverse medication and vaccination contribute enormously to develop  mental health issues among people. During previous infection treatment with  diverse vaccination and antiviral agent, the common mental health issues found to  be a mood disorder, delirium, schizophrenia, and psychotic symptoms.  Cumbersomely, it is almost impossible to treat mental health issues during the  pandemic with the help of only pharmacological availability. Hence psychological  intervention is also important to ameliorate better consequences. The current  study highlights the impact of CoViD-19 related diverse medication and  vaccination on the mental health of the people.

AB  - We investigated Favipiravir (FPV) efficacy in mild cases of COVID-19 without pneumonia and its effects towards viral clearance, clinical condition, and risk  of COVID-19 pneumonia development. PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients  without pneumonia were enrolled (2:1) within 10 days of symptomatic onset into  FPV and control arms. The former received 1800 mg FPV twice-daily (BID) on Day 1  and 800 mg BID 5-14 days thereafter until negative viral detection, while the  latter received only supportive care. The primary endpoint was time to clinical  improvement, defined by a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of ≤1. 62 patients  (41 female) comprised the FPV arm (median age: 32 years, median BMI: 22 kg/m²)  and 31 patients (19 female) comprised the control arm (median age: 28 years,  median BMI: 22 kg/m²). The median time to sustained clinical improvement, by  NEWS, was 2 and 14 days for FPV and control arms, respectively (adjusted hazard  ratio (aHR) of 2.77, 95% CI 1.57-4.88, P < .001). The FPV arm also had  significantly higher likelihoods of clinical improvement within 14 days after  enrolment by NEWS (79% vs. 32% respectively, P < .001). 8 (12.9%) and 7 (22.6%)  patients in FPV and control arms developed mild pneumonia at a median (range) of  6.5 (1-13) and 7 (1-13) days after treatment, respectively (P = .316). All  recovered well without complications. We can conclude that early treatment of FPV  in symptomatic COVID-19 patients without pneumonia was associated with faster  clinical improvement.Trial registration: Thai Clinical Trials Registry  identifier: TCTR20200514001.

AB  - The spread of new coronavirus infection starting December 2019 as novel SARS-CoV-2, identified as the causing agent of COVID-19, has affected all over  the world and been declared as pandemic. Approximately, more than 8,807,398  confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and 464,483 deaths have been reported  globally till the end of 21 June 2020. Until now, there is no specific drug  therapy or vaccine available for the treatment of COVID-19. However, some  potential antimalarial drugs like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin,  antifilarial drug ivermectin and antiviral drugs have been tested by many  research groups worldwide for their possible effect against the COVID-19.  Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin have been identified to act by creating the  acidic condition in cells and inhibiting the importin (IMPα/β1) mediated viral  import. There is a possibility that some other antimalarial drugs/antibiotics in  combination with immunomodulators may help in combatting this pandemic disease.  Therefore, this review focuses on the current use of various drugs as single  agents (hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin, favipiravir, remdesivir,  umifenovir, teicoplanin, nitazoxanide, doxycycline, and dexamethasone) or in  combinations with immunomodulators additionally. Furthermore, possible mode of  action, efficacy and current stage of clinical trials of various drug  combinations against COVID-19 disease has also been discussed in  detail.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019, have highlighted the concerns about the lack of potential vaccines or  antivirals approved for inhibition of CoVs infection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent  RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is almost preserved across different viral species  can be a potential target for development of antiviral drugs, including  nucleoside analogues (NA). However, ExoN proofreading activity of CoVs leads to  their protection from several NAs. Therefore, potential platforms based on the  development of efficient NAs with broad-spectrum efficacy against human CoVs  should be explored. This study was then aimed to present an overview on the  development of NAs-based drug repurposing for targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by  computational analysis. Afterwards, the clinical development of some NAs  including Favipiravir, Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Tenofovir, and Remdesivir as  potential inhibitors of RdRp, were surveyed. Overall, exploring broad-spectrum  NAs as promising inhibitors of RdRp may provide useful information about the  identification of potential antiviral repurposed drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - We assessed various newly generated compounds that target the main protease (M(pro)) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and  various previously known compounds reportedly active against SARS-CoV-2,  employing RNA quantitative PCR (RNA-qPCR), cytopathicity assays, and  immunocytochemistry. Here, we show that two indole-chloropyridinyl-ester  derivatives, GRL-0820 and GRL-0920, exerted potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 in  cell-based assays performed using VeroE6 cells and TMPRSS2-overexpressing VeroE6  cells. While GRL-0820 and the nucleotide analog remdesivir blocked SARS-CoV-2  infection, viral breakthrough occurred. No significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity  was found for several compounds reportedly active against SARS-CoV-2 such as  lopinavir, nelfinavir, nitazoxanide, favipiravir, and hydroxychroloquine. In  contrast, GRL-0920 exerted potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 (50% effective  concentration [EC(50)] = 2.8 μM) and dramatically reduced the infectivity,  replication, and cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 without significant toxicity as  examined with immunocytochemistry. Structural modeling shows that indole and  chloropyridinyl of the derivatives interact with two catalytic dyad residues of  M(pro), Cys145 and His41, resulting in covalent bonding, which was verified using  high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS), suggesting  that the indole moiety is critical for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of the  derivatives. GRL-0920 might serve as a potential therapeutic for coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19) and might be optimized to generate more-potent  anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds.IMPORTANCE Targeting the main protease (M(pro)) of  SARS-CoV-2, we identified two indole-chloropyridinyl-ester derivatives, GRL-0820  and GRL-0920, active against SARS-CoV-2, employing RNA-qPCR and  immunocytochemistry and show that the two compounds exerted potent activity  against SARS-CoV-2.

AU  - McCullough, Peter A.
T2  - Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy
AB  - It is becoming increasingly clear that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), like most human viral infections, will require  multiple drugs in combination to treat COVID-19 illness. In this issue of the  Journal, Doi and colleagues describe successful treatment of patients with early  COVID-19 with favipiravir, an oral polymerase inhibitor, to rapidly and  substantially clear SARS-CoV-2 from nasal secretions irrespective if it was  started relatively early or later within the first week of infection. These data  support the concept that favipiravir could be paired with at least one more  off-target antiviral agent (doxycycline, azithromycin, or ivermectin) followed by  corticosteroids and antithrombotics to prevent COVID-19 hospitalization and death  in those over age 50 and/or those with one or more comorbidities. Clinical trials  and advanced practice should immediately pivot to combination/sequential drug  therapy for ambulatory COVID-19 illness.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Nafamostat mesylate (NM) is used clinically in combination with antiviral drugs to treat coronavirus disease (COVID-19). One of  the adverse events of NM is hyperkalaemia due to inhibition of the  amiloride-sensitive sodium channels (ENaC). The incidence and risk factors for  hyperkalaemia due to NM have been studied in patients with pancreatitis but not  in COVID-19. COVID-19 can be associated with hypokalaemia or hyperkalaemia, and  SARS-CoV-2 is thought to inhibit ENaC. Therefore, frequency and risk factors for  hyperkalaemia due to NM may differ between COVID-19 and pancreatitis.  Hyperkalaemia may worsen the respiratory condition of patients. The objective of  this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors for hyperkalaemia in  COVID-19 patients treated with favipiravir, dexamethasone and NM. METHODS: This  retrospective study reviewed the records of hospitalized COVID-19 patients  treated with favipiravir and dexamethasone, with or without NM, between March  2020 and January 2021. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed  to identify the risk factors for hyperkalaemia. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of 45  patients who received favipiravir and dexamethasone with NM for the treatment of  COVID-19, 21 (47%) experienced hyperkalaemia. The duration of NM administration  was a significant predictor of hyperkalaemia (odds ratio: 1.55, 95% confidence  interval: 1.04-2.31, p = 0.031). The receiver-operating characteristic curve  analysis determined that the cut-off value for predicting the number of days  until the onset of hyperkalaemia was 6 days and the area under the curve was  0.707. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the incidence of  hyperkalaemia is high in patients treated for COVID-19 with NM, and that the  duration of NM administration is a key risk factor. When NM is administered for  the treatment of COVID-19, it should be discontinued within 6 days to minimize  the risk of hyperkalaemia.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) caused a pandemic that first discovered in Wuhan, China. While 10% of the patients have  asymptomatic infection, 15-20% have lung involvement, 5-10% have multiple organ  failure, and macrophage activation syndrome. Chronic respiratory diseases,  diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cancer are risk factors for mortality.  Prognosis or optimal treatment strategy for renal transplant recipients in  SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unknown. Besides fatal cases, there were also  milder case reports. In addition, COVID-19 treatment and the maintenance  immunosuppression strategy is still under debate. Antiviral therapies and drug  interactions are special topics for these patients. To the best of our knowledge,  favipiravir and anti-cytokine treatments have not been previously reported in a  kidney transplant recipient with SARS-CoV-2 infection before. We report a case of  SARS-CoV-2 infection in a kidney transplant recipient with fatal outcomes.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic posed a serious public health concern and started a race against time for researchers to  discover an effective and safe therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),  the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to describe the history,  efficacy, and safety of five potential therapeutics for COVID-19, remdesivir,  favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma. A  literature review was conducted through October 2020 to identify published  studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of these five potential therapeutics.  Clinical improvement was used to assess the efficacy, while reported withdrawals  from study participation and adverse events were used to evaluate the safety. In  total, 95 clinical studies (6 interventional and 89 observational studies) were  obtained, of which 42 were included in this review. The evaluation of the  efficacy and safety profiles is challenging due to the limitations of the  clinical studies on one hand, and the limited number of randomized controlled  trials (RCTs) on the other. Moreover, there was insufficient evidence to support  repurposing remdesivir, favipiravir, and tocilizumab for COVID-19.

AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize the clinical features and outcome of patients treated at a specialized hospital for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We  retrospectively reviewed the symptoms on admission, treatment, and outcome of a  total of 300 patients with mild (peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) ≥ 96%),  moderate I (93% < SpO(2) < 96%), moderate II (SpO(2) ≤ 93%) and severe (requiring  admission to the ICU or mechanical ventilation) COVID-19. RESULTS: Median age was  53 (interquartile range [IQR] 33-72) years and 57% was male. The number of  patients with mild, moderate I, II and severe condition was 85, 138, 61 and 16,  respectively. Common presenting symptoms were cough (n = 71), loss of taste (42),  loss of smell (39), fever ≥ 37.5 °C (36). Dyspnea was observed only 21 cases; 57  reported no symptoms on admission. Favipiravir, ciclesonide, dexamethasone, and  heparin were administered in 106, 168, 65, and 38 patients, respectively, but not  remdesivir. The median duration of hospitalization was 10 (7-15) days. All  patients with mild and moderate I severity were discharged. Among the 77 patients  classified as moderate II or severe, 3 were transferred to tertiary hospitals for  further treatment on the day of admission. The respiratory condition worsened in  21 patients; 18 required transfer to tertiary hospitals 3 (median) days after  admission and 3 died. CONCLUSION: Respiratory condition recovered in 92%; whereas  it worsened in 7% and the mortality rate was 1%. The ratios of male patients, of  patients with diabetes mellitus in those with the decreased respiratory  condition, were significantly higher than recovered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the identification of effective antiviral drugs is crucial. Unfortunately, no specific treatment or  vaccine is available to date. OBJECTIVE: Here, we aimed to predict the  interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and protein targets from the human body for  some flavone molecules (kaempferol, morin, pectolinarin, myricitrin, and  herbacetin) in comparison to synthetic compounds (hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir,  ribavirin, ritonavir, AMD-070, favipiravir). METHODS: Using MOE software and  advanced bioinformatics and cheminformatics portals, we conducted an extensive  analysis based on various structural and functional features of compounds, such  as their amphiphilic field, flexibility, and steric features. The structural  similarity analysis of natural and synthetic compounds was performed using  Tanimoto coefficients. The interactions of some compounds with SARS-CoV-2  3CLprotease or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were described using 2D  protein-ligand interaction diagrams based on known crystal structures. The  potential targets of considered compounds were identified using the  SwissTargetPrediction web tool. RESULTS: Our results showed that remdesivir,  pectolinarin, and ritonavir present a strong structural similarity which may be  correlated to their similar biological activity. As common molecular targets of  compounds in the human body, ritonavir, kaempferol, morin, and herbacetin can  activate multidrug resistance-associated proteins, while remdesivir, ribavirin,  and pectolinarin appear as ligands for adenosine receptors. CONCLUSION: Our  evaluation recommends remdesivir, pectolinarin, and ritonavir as promising anti-  SARS-CoV-2 agents.

T2  - Drug discoveries & therapeutics
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has accounted for ~ 4.3 million confirmed cases and ~ 292,000 deaths (till 12(th) May, 2020) across the globe since its outbreak. Several  anti-viral drugs such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors (remdesivir,  favipiravir, ribavirin), protease inhibitors (lopinavir, ritonavir) and drugs  targeting endocytic pathway (hydroxychloroquine) are being evaluated for COVID-19  but standard therapeutics yet not available. Severe health deterioration in  critically ill patients is characterized by pulmonary edema, severe respiratory  distress, cytokine storm and septic shock. To combat cytokine storm,  immune-therapy targeting IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and TNFα are being evaluated and one of  the promising immune-modulator is the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that can  surmount the severity of COVID-19 infections. Recent studies have shown that  MSC-therapy significantly dampens the cytokine storm in critically ill COVID-19  patients. This communication endows with the insight of stem cell therapy and  summarizes the recent studies on COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Drug Repurposing: A Strategy for Discovering Inhibitors against Emerging Viral Infections.
AU  - Dos Santos Nascimento, Igor José

AU  - da Silva-Júnior, Edeildo Ferreira
T2  - Current medicinal chemistry
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral diseases are responsible for several deaths around the world. Over the past few years, the world has seen several outbreaks caused by viral  diseases that, for a long time, seemed to possess no risk. These are diseases  that have been forgotten for a long time and, until nowadays, there are no  approved drugs or vaccines, leading the pharmaceutical industry and several  research groups to run out of time in the search for new pharmacological  treatments or prevention methods. In this context, drug repurposing proves to be  a fast and economically viable technique, considering the fact that it uses drugs  that have a well-established safety profile. Thus, in this review, we present the  main advances in drug repurposing and their benefit for searching new treatments  against emerging viral diseases. METHODS: We conducted a search in the  bibliographic databases (Science Direct, Bentham Science, PubMed, Springer, ACS  Publisher, Wiley, and NIH's COVID-19 Portfolio) using the keywords "drug  repurposing", "emerging viral infections" and each of the diseases reported here  (CoV; ZIKV; DENV; CHIKV; EBOV and MARV) as an inclusion/exclusion criterion. A  subjective analysis was performed regarding the quality of the works for  inclusion in this manuscript. Thus, the selected works were those that presented  drugs repositioned against the emerging viral diseases presented here by means of  computational, high-throughput screening or phenotype-based strategies, with no  time limit and of relevant scientific value. RESULTS: 291 papers were selected,  24 of which were CHIKV; 52 for ZIKV; 43 for DENV; 35 for EBOV; 10 for MARV; and  56 for CoV and the rest (72 papers) related to the drugs repurposing and emerging  viral diseases. Among CoV-related articles, most were published in 2020 (31  papers), updating the current topic. Besides, between the years 2003 - 2005, 10  articles were created, and from 2011 - 2015, there were 7 articles, portraying  the outbreaks that occurred at that time. For ZIKV, similar to CoV, most  publications were during the period of outbreaks between the years 2016 - 2017  (23 articles). Similarly, most CHIKV (13 papers) and DENV (14 papers)  publications occur at the same time interval. For EBOV (13 papers) and MARV (4  papers), they were between the years 2015 - 2016. Through this review, several  drugs were highlighted that can be evolved in vivo and clinical trials as  possible used against these pathogens showed that remdesivir represent potential  treatments against CoV. Furthermore, ribavirin may also be a potential treatment  against CHIKV; sofosbuvir against ZIKV; celgosivir against DENV, and favipiravir  against EBOV and MARV, representing new hopes against these pathogens.  CONCLUSION: The conclusions of this review manuscript show the potential of the  drug repurposing strategy in the discovery of new pharmaceutical products, as  from this approach, drugs could be used against emerging viral diseases. Thus,  this strategy deserves more attention among research groups and is a promising  approach to the discovery of new drugs against emerging viral diseases and also  other diseases.

AB  - Since the appearance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), numerous studies have been conducted to find effective therapeutics. Favipiravir (FVP) is one of  the repurposed drugs which has been authorized in a few countries on an emergency  basis to treat COVID-19. Elderly individuals especially 65 years or older are  more prone to develop severe illness. We aim to provide a short summary of the  current knowledge of the antiviral efficacy of favipiravir with respect to severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected elderly patients.  We found that it is rather controversial whether favipiravir is effective against  SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data regarding patients 65 years or older is not sufficient  to support or reject the usage of favipiravir for COVD-19 treatment. Further  studies would be advisable to elicit the efficiency of favipiravir in elderly  COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Favipiravir tautomerism: a theoretical insight.
AU  - Antonov, Liudmil
T2  - Theoretical chemistry accounts
AB  - There is no experimental information about the tautomerism of Favipiravir (T-705). Therefore, its tautomeric state was predicted by using density  functional theory in gas phase and in solution (toluene, acetonitrile and water).  The results have shown that, in neutral state, the enol form is strongly  dominating in both gas phase and solution. The carboxamide group is easily  protonated in the presence of acid, which leads to shift of the tautomeric  equilibrium toward the keto tautomer. In order to validate the theoretical  predictions, 2-hydroxy pyridine and 2-hydroxy pyrazine were also included in the  set of studied compounds. The available experimental data about their tautomerism  are in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions, which validate the  conclusions made for T-705.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The antiviral drug favipiravir has been shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2  (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we investigated the clinical benefits and initiation  of favipiravir treatment in patients with non-severe coronavirus-disease-2019  (COVID-19). METHODS: This study was a single-center retrospective cohort study.  Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn to calculate the area under  the curve, and the optimal cut-off values for the time to initiate favipiravir  treatment were calculated to predict defervescence within seven days. Univariate  and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify potential  influencing factors of defervescence. This was defined as a body temperature of  less than 37 °C for at least 2 days. RESULTS: Data from 41 patients were used for  the efficacy assessment. The days from the onset of fever to defervescence showed  a positive correlation with the duration from the onset of fever to initiation of  favipiravir treatment (r = 0.548, P < 0.001). The optimal cut-off value was the  administration of favipiravir on day 4. Patients were assigned to two groups  based on the optimal cut-off value from onset to initiation of favipiravir  treatment: early treatment group (within 4-days) and late treatment group (more  than 4-days). In the multivariate analysis, when adjusted for age, sex, and days  from onset to initiation of favipiravir treatment, the significant factors were  male sex and days of initiation of the favipiravir treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We  recommend that if favipiravir is to be used for treatment, it should be initiated  as early as possible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2019, SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 emerged. Severe COVID-19 symptoms may evolve by virtue of hyperactivation of the immune system. Equally,  immunocompromised patients may be at increased risk to develop COVID-19. However,  treatment guidelines for children following liver transplantation are elusive.  METHODS: As a liver transplantation center, we diagnosed and followed up 10  children (male/female: 8/2) with a median age of 8.5 years (IQR: 5.2-11.0), with  COVID-19 post-liver transplant between March 2019 and December 2020. COVID-19  diagnosis was based on PCR test and or florid X-ray findings compatible with  COVID-19 in the absence of other cause. We retrospectively collected clinical and  laboratory data from electronic patient records following written consent from  patients/parents. RESULTS: Nine patients were diagnosed as definitive (PCR  positive) with one patient being diagnosed as probable COVID-19. Seven patients  recovered without any support whereas three were admitted for non-invasive  oxygenation. Lymphopenia and/or high levels of serum IL-6 were detected in four  patients. Six patients mounted anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at median 30 days (IQR:  26.5-119.0) following COVID-19 diagnosis. Antibiotic therapy, favipiravir,  anakinra, and IVIG were used as treatment in 4,1,1 and 2 patients, respectively.  Furthermore, we kept the tacrolimus with or without everolimus but stopped MMF in  2 patients. Importantly, liver allograft function was retained in all patients.  CONCLUSIONS: We found that being immunocompromised did not affect disease  severity nor survival. Stopping MMF yet continuing with tacrolimus was an apt  treatment modality in these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Favipiravir is generally used in treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in Turkey. OBJECTIVE: To determine the side effects of  favipiravir and whether it is a good treatment option. DESIGN AND SETTING:  Retrospective study conducted in Atatürk Chest Diseases and Chest Surgery  Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. METHODS: 357 patients who  completed favipiravir treatment at the recommended dose were included. 37  patients with drug side effects and 320 patients without drug side effects were  examined in two groups. RESULTS: Side effects were observed in 37 (10.36%) out of  357 patients using favipiravir. The most common side effect was liver  dysfunction, in 26 (7.28%) of the patients. The following other side effects were  also observed: diarrhea (1.4%), nausea (0.84%), abdominal pain (0.28%) and  thrombocytopenia (0.28%). One patient (0.28%) presented both increased  transaminases and nausea. CONCLUSION: In this study, it was determined that  favipiravir may constitute an alternative for treating COVID-19 pneumonia given  that its side effects are generally well tolerated and not serious.

AB  - At present, neither specific antiviral drugs, nor vaccine is recommended for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. In this review we discuss the  drugs suggested as therapy for COVID-19 infection, with a focus on chloroquine  and hydroxychloroquine. The list of drugs used for COVID-19 treatment includes a  combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir,  alpha-interferon, ribavirin, atazanavir, umifenovir, and tocilizumab. As their  efficacy and safety are under investigation, none of the regulatory agencies  approved them for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Although chloroquine and  hydroxychloroquine possess antiviral and immunomodulatory effects, in practice  benefit of their use for COVID-19 treatment is controversial. Several studies  investigating hydroxychloroquine were stopped and the French national medicines  regulator suspended its use in clinical trials because of safety concerns. The  results from the double-blind, randomised clinical trials, including large number  of participants, will add better insight into the role of these two drugs as  already available and affordable, antimalarial therapy. The ethical issue on  emergency use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the settings of COVID-19  should be carefully managed, with adherence to the "monitored emergency use of  unregistered and experimental interventions" (MEURI) framework or be ethically  approved as a trial, as stated by the WHO. Potential shortage of  chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine on the market can be overbridged with regular  prescriptions by medical doctors and national drug agency should ensure  sufficient quantities of these drugs for standard indications.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Comparative data on hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir, commonly used agents in the treatment of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), are still  limited. In this study, it was aimed to compare treatment outcomes in healthcare  workers with COVID-19 who were prospectively followed by the occupational health  and safety unit. METHODS: A total of 237 healthcare-workers, diagnosed as mild or  moderate COVID-19 between March 11, 2020 and January 1, 2021, were given  hydroxychloroquine (n = 114) or favipiravir (n = 123). Clinical and laboratory  findings were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 33.4±11.5  years. The mean time to negative PCR was found to be significantly shorter in  patients receiving favipiravir compared to the hydroxychloroquine group (10.9 vs.  13.9 days; p < 0.001). The rate of hospitalization in the hydroxychloroquine  group was significantly higher than favipiravir group (15.8% vs. 3.3%). In terms  of side effects; the frequency of diarrhea in patients receiving  hydroxychloroquine was significantly higher than that in the favipiravir group  (31.6% vs. 6.5%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine were  similar in terms of improvement of clinical symptoms of healthcare workers with  mild or moderate COVID-19 infection, but favipiravir was significantly more  effective in reducing viral load and hospitalization rates. Furthermore,  favipiravir caused significantly less side-effects than hydroxychloroquine.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 20 million people  infected worldwide with an average mortality rate of 3.6%. This virus poses major  challenges to public health, as it not only is highly contagious but also can be  transmitted by asymptomatic infected individuals. COVID-19 is clinically  difficult to manage due to a lack of specific antiviral drugs or vaccines. In  this article, Chinese therapy strategies for treating COVID-19 patients,  including current applications of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), are  comprehensively reviewed. Furthermore, 72 small molecules from natural products  and TCM with reported antiviral activity against human coronaviruses (CoVs) are  identified from published literature, and their potential applications in  combating SARS-CoV-2 are discussed. Among these, the clinical efficacies of some  accessible drugs such as remdesivir (RDV) and favipiravir (FPV) for COVID-19 are  emphatically summarized. We hope this review provides a foundation for managing  the worsening pandemic and developing antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia may cause cystic features of lung parenchyma which can resolve or progress to larger blebs.  Pneumothorax was more likely in patients with neutrophilia, severe lung injury  and a prolonged clinical course. The timely diagnosis and management will reduce  COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We present 11 cases of  spontaneous pneumothorax managed with chest tube thoracostomy or high-dose oxygen  therapy. Isolated spontaneous pneumothorax was detected in all cases. RESULTS:  Eight cases were male and 3 cases were female. There were bilateral ground-glass  opacities or pulmonary infiltrates in the parenchyma of the 10 cases. We detected  neutrophilia, lymphopaenia and increased C-reactive protein, Ferritin, lactate  dehydrogenase, D-Dimer, interleukin-6 levels in almost all cases. Chest tube  thoracostomy was sufficient to treat pneumothorax in our 9 of case. In 2 cases,  pneumothorax healed with high-dose oxygen therapy. Favipiravir and antibiotic  treatment were given to different 10 patients. In our institution, all patients  with COVID-19 infection were placed on prophylactic or therapeutic  anticoagulation, unless contraindicated. The treatments of patients diagnosed  with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax during the pandemic period and those  diagnosed with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in the previous 3 years were  compared with the durations of tube thoracostomy performed in both groups.  CONCLUSIONS: The increased number of cases of pneumothorax suggests that  pneumothorax may be a complication of COVID-19 infection. During medical  treatment of COVID-19, pneumothorax may be the only reason for hospitalization.  Although tube thoracostomy is a sufficient treatment option in most cases,  clinicians should be aware of the difficulties that may arise in diagnosis and  treatment.

AB  - The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an epidemic disease that appeared at the end of the year 2019 with a sudden increase in number and came to be  considered as a pandemic disease caused by a viral infection which has threatened  most countries for an emergency search for new anti-SARS-COV drugs /vaccines. At  present, the number of clinical trials is ongoing worldwide on different drugs  i.e. Hydroxychloroquine, Remedisvir, Favipiravir that utilize various mechanisms  of action. A few countries are currently processing clinical trials, which may  result in a positive outcome. Favipiravir (FPV) represents one of the feasible  treatment options for COVID-19, if the result of the trials turns out positive.  Favipiravir will be one of the developed possibly authoritative drugs to warrant  benefits to mankind with large-scale production to meet the demands of the  current pandemic Covid-19 outbreak and future epidemic outbreaks. In this review,  the authors tried to explore key molecules, which will be supportive for devising  COVID-19 research.

AB  - BACKGROUNDSARS-CoV-2 infection induces mucin overexpression, further promoting disease. Given that mucins are critical components of innate immunity, unraveling  their expression profiles that dictate the course of disease could greatly  enhance our understanding and management of COVID-19.METHODSUsing validated  RT-PCR assays, we assessed mucin mRNA expression in the blood of patients with  symptomatic COVID-19 compared with symptomatic patients without COVID-19 and  healthy controls and correlated the data with clinical outcome parameters.  Additionally, we analyzed mucin expression in mucus and lung tissue from patients  with COVID-19 and investigated the effect of drugs for COVID-19 treatment on  SARS-CoV-2-induced mucin expression in pulmonary epithelial cells.RESULTSWe  identified a dynamic blood mucin mRNA signature that clearly distinguished  patients with symptomatic COVID-19 from patients without COVID-19 based on  expression of MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC6, MUC13, MUC16, and MUC20 (AUCROC of 91.8%;  sensitivity and specificity of 90.6% and 93.3%, respectively) and that  discriminated between mild and critical COVID-19 based on the expression of  MUC16, MUC20, and MUC21 (AUCROC of 89.1%; sensitivity and specificity of 90.0%  and 85.7%, respectively). Differences in the transcriptional landscape of mucins  in critical cases compared with mild cases identified associations with COVID-19  symptoms, respiratory support, organ failure, secondary infections, and  mortality. Furthermore, we identified different mucins in the mucus and lung  tissue of critically ill COVID-19 patients and showed the ability of baricitinib,  tocilizumab, favipiravir, and remdesivir to suppress expression of  SARS-CoV-2-induced mucins.CONCLUSIONThis multifaceted blood mucin mRNA signature  showed the potential role of mucin profiling in diagnosing, estimating severity,  and guiding treatment options in patients with COVID-19.FUNDINGThe Antwerp  University Research and the Research Foundation Flanders COVID-19 funds.

AB  - The effect of treatment with favipiravir, an antiviral purine nucleoside analog, for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the production and duration of  neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 was explored. There were 17 age-, gender-,  and body mass index-matched pairs of favipiravir treated versus control selected  from a total of 99 patients recovered from moderate COVID-19. These subjects  participated in the longitudinal (&gt;6 months) analysis of (i) SARS-CoV-2 spike  protein's receptor-binding domain IgG, (ii) virus neutralization assay using  authentic virus, and (iii) neutralization potency against original (WT)  SARS-CoV-2 and cross-neutralization against B.1.351 (beta) variant carrying  triple mutations of K417N, E484K, and N501Y. The results demonstrate that the use  of favipiravir: (1) significantly accelerated the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 in  the case vs. control groups (p = 0.027), (2) preserved the generation and  persistence of neutralizing antibodies in the host, and (3) did not interfere the  maturation of neutralizing potency of anti-SARS-CoV-2 and neutralizing breadth  against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In conclusion, treatment of COVID-19 with  favipiravir accelerates viral clearance and does not interfere the generation or  maturation of neutralizing potency against both WT SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

AB  - The human population is still facing appalling conditions due to several outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.  The absence of specific drugs, appropriate vaccines for mutants, and knowledge of  potential therapeutic agents makes this situation more difficult. Several 1, 2,  4-triazolo [1, 5-a] pyrimidine (TP)-derivative compounds were comprehensively  studied for antiviral activities against RNA polymerase of HIV, HCV, and  influenza viruses, and showed immense pharmacological interest. Therefore,  TP-derivative compounds can be repurposed against the RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase (RdRp) protein of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, a meta-analysis was  performed to ensure the genomic variability and stability of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp  protein. The molecular docking of natural and synthetic TP compounds to RdRp and  molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to analyse the dynamic  behaviour of TP compounds at the active site of the RdRp protein. TP compounds  were also docked against other non-structural proteins (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP5,  NSP8, NSP13, and NSP15) of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the inhibition potential of  TP compounds was compared with Remdesivir and Favipiravir drugs as a positive  control. Additionally, TP compounds were analysed for inhibitory activity against  SARS-CoV RdRp protein. This study demonstrates that TP analogues (monomethylated  triazolopyrimidine and essramycin) represent potential lead molecules for  designing an effective inhibitor to control viral replication. Furthermore, in  vitro and in vivo studies will strengthen the use of these inhibitors as suitable  drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - We herein report the first case of a fever induced by favipiravir, a potential coronavirus disease 2019 therapeutic drug. An 82-year-old man diagnosed with  bilateral pneumonia was transferred to our hospital following a positive severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction test. He was  treated with compassionate use of favipiravir. Both his oxygen demand and fever  gradually improved after admission; however, his fever relapsed, and the  C-reactive protein (CRP) levels increased on day 7. We diagnosed his fever as  being favipiravir-induced. The fever resolved a few days after favipiravir  discontinuation, demonstrating the accuracy of the diagnosis. This case revealed  that favipiravir can induce a fever.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of Favipiravir compared to the standard therapy in treating patients with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This is a  retrospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were treated with  favipiravir, versus comparison group that received the standard of care. RESULTS:  A total of 226 patients were included; 110 patients received favipiravir and 116  patients received standard of care. Patients who received favipiravir had longer  time to recovery (14.2 ± 8.8 versus 12.8 ± 5.2, p = 0.17). Favipiravir was  associated with an improved early day 14 mortality (4 [3.6%] versus 11 [9.5%]), p  = 0.008), but was associated with a higher day 28 mortality (26 [23.6%] versus 11  [9.5%], p = 0.02). The overall mortality was higher in the favipiravir versus the  standard of care group but difference was not statistically significant (33  [30.0%] versus 24 [20.7%], p = 0.10). CONCLUSION: The addition of favipiravir to  standard of care was not associated with any improvement in clinical outcomes or  mortality. Larger randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to further  assess the efficacy of favipiravir.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PIMS) are a major public health issue affecting many  people worldwide. Although there are new studies in children, little is known  about these two new conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare  the clinical and laboratory features of children with COVID-19 and PIMS. METHODS:  We conducted a prospective, single-center study of pediatric COVID-19 and PIMS at  a tertiary care hospital in Turkey between November 2020 and March 2021. RESULTS:  A total of 115 patients with COVID-19 and PIMS were examined during the study  period. The median age was 60 (range, 1-215) months and 64% of the patients were  male. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (70%) and cough (43%).  Conjunctivitis and skin rash were not seen in PIMS patients. Of all patients, 64%  had a history of close contact in household. Lymphopenia was present in 34/115  (30%) patients. Acute phase reactants were significantly higher in PIMS patients.  Abnormal chest computed tomography scan findings were detected in 68% of the  patients, while 36% had abnormal echocardiographic findings. In multivariate  analysis, longer duration of fever, diarrhea, lower thrombocyte and higher  neutrophil count were significantly associated with diagnosis of PIMS. The  treatment included antibiotics, favipiravir, intravenous immunoglobulin,  corticosteroids, interleukin-1 blockade. and supportive therapy. Seven patients  (6%) required intensive care support. All patients were discharged without any  complications, except one who died. CONCLUSIONS: Longer duration of fever,  diarrhea, lower thrombocyte, and higher neutrophil count can warn clinicians for  diagnosis of PIMS.

AB  - Currently, limited therapeutic options are available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have developed a set of pyrazine-based  small molecules. A series of pyrazine conjugates was synthesized by  microwave-assisted click chemistry and benzotriazole chemistry. All the  synthesized conjugates were screened against the SAR-CoV-2 virus and their  cytotoxicity was determined. Computational studies were carried out to validate  the biological data. Some of the pyrazine-triazole conjugates (5 d-g) and  (S)-N-(1-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-2-phenylethyl)pyrazine-2-carboxamide 12 i show  significant potency against SARS-CoV-2 among the synthesized conjugates. The  selectivity index (SI) of potent conjugates indicates significant efficacy  compared to the reference drug (Favipiravir).

The gender, age, body mass index (BMI),  Fitzpatrick's skin-type, hair color, N-acetylcysteine use, presence and the  intensity of fluorescent reflection under Wood's light in the lunulae of the  fingernails, hair, and the face were recorded. RESULTS: There were 275 patients,  144 (52.4%) of whom were women. 165 (57.9%) had used treatment for a maximum of  5 days, 99 (34.7%) for 6-10 days, and 21 (7.4%) for more than ten days. Using  more than 22 tablets of favipiravir increased the probability of detecting  fluorescence in the lunulae by 6.72 (2.61-17.23) times. Using more than 28  tablets increased the risk of fluorescence in hair and the T-zone by 5.92  (2.43-14.71) and 2.88 (1.11-7.47) times, respectively. No relationship was found  between the fluorescence intensity in any localization and the total dose.  However, we determined a negative correlation between the elapsed time after the  last dose and the fluorescence intensity in the lunulae and the T-zone (p=0.036;  p=0.031; respectively). It was noted that BMI negatively correlated with the  fluorescence intensity in the lunulae (p=0.001). Skin type was related to  intensity for all localizations (p<0.001). Fluorescence was found in the lunulae  with significantly less frequency in patients using N-acetylcysteine (p=0.040).  CONCLUSIONS: We must be aware of favipiravir-induced phototoxicity.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread around the globe after its emergence in Wuhan in December 2019. With no specific  therapeutic and prophylactic options available, the virus has infected millions  of people of which more than half a million succumbed to the viral disease,  COVID-19. The urgent need for an effective treatment together with a lack of  small animal infection models has led to clinical trials using repurposed drugs  without preclinical evidence of their in vivo efficacy. We established an  infection model in Syrian hamsters to evaluate the efficacy of small molecules on  both infection and transmission. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters with a  low dose of favipiravir or hydroxychloroquine with(out) azithromycin resulted in,  respectively, a mild or no reduction in virus levels. However, high doses of  favipiravir significantly reduced infectious virus titers in the lungs and  markedly improved lung histopathology. Moreover, a high dose of favipiravir  decreased virus transmission by direct contact, whereas hydroxychloroquine failed  as prophylaxis. Pharmacokinetic modeling of hydroxychloroquine suggested that the  total lung exposure to the drug did not cause the failure. Our data on  hydroxychloroquine (together with previous reports in macaques and ferrets) thus  provide no scientific basis for the use of this drug in COVID-19 patients. In  contrast, the results with favipiravir demonstrate that an antiviral drug at  nontoxic doses exhibits a marked protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 in a small  animal model. Clinical studies are required to assess whether a similar antiviral  effect is achievable in humans without toxic effects.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The global rise of syphilis infections and the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are causes for concern. We herein report a rare  case of concurrent primary syphilis and COVID-19. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old man  was admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Although COVID-19 pneumonia appeared  during ciclesonide and favipiravir treatment, his symptoms improved without  developing severe hypoxemia. A small, red ulcer on the left-side of his glans  penis was noted and left inguinal lymph node swellings were detected on computed  tomography (CT). He reported that his last engagement in sexual intercourse had  been 3 months previously, and that his partner had subsequently been diagnosed  with syphilis. Although both serum Treponema pallidum (TP) antibody and rapid  plasma reagin (RPR) quantitative tests were negative on the day of admission, we  clinically diagnosed a suspected case of primary syphilis and started treatment  with amoxicillin (1500 mg/day). We subsequently learned that the TP antibody and  RPR quantitative tests had been positive 4 days before starting syphilis  treatment. Amoxicillin treatment was continued for 61 days, and the ulcer  gradually improved. One year later, the RPR quantitative test was negative, and  CT revealed a reduction in size of the inguinal lymph nodes and no residual signs  of COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of syphilis has been increasing  even during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the incidence of concurrent syphilis and  COVID-19 might be higher than is recognized. Asking patients with COVID-19 about  high-risk sexual behavior and genital lesions could help with early diagnosis of  syphilis.

AB  - In regard to the global pandemic of COVID-19, it seems that persons with epilepsy (PWE) are not more vulnerable to get infected by SARS-CoV-2, nor are they more  susceptible to a critical course of the disease. However, management of acute  seizures in patients with COVID-19 as well as management of PWE and COVID-19  needs to consider potential drug-drug interactions between antiseizure drugs and  candidate drugs currently assessed as therapeutic options for COVID-19.  Repurposing of several licensed and investigational drugs is discussed for  therapeutic management of COVID-19. While for none of these approaches, efficacy  and tolerability has been confirmed yet in sufficiently powered and controlled  clinical studies, testing is ongoing with multiple clinical trials worldwide.  Here, we have summarized the possible mechanisms of action of drugs currently  considered as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19 management along with  possible and confirmed drug-drug interactions that should be considered for a  combination of antiseizure drugs and COVID-19 candidate drugs. Our review  suggests that potential drug-drug interactions should be taken into account with  drugs such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir while  remdesivir and tocilizumab may be less prone to clinically relevant interactions  with ASMs.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 has become a global threat. Since its first outbreak from Wuhan, China in December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has gone through structural  changes arising due to mutations in its surface glycoprotein. These mutations  have led to the emergence of different genetic variants threatening public health  due to increased transmission and virulence. As new drug development is a long  process, repurposing existing antiviral drugs with potential activity against  SARS-CoV-2 might be a possible solution to mitigate the current situation.  Methods: This study focused on utilizing molecular docking to determine the  effect of potential drugs on several variants of concern (VOCs). The effect of  various drugs such as baricitinib, favipiravir, lopinavir, remdesivir and  dexamethasone, which might have the potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections as  evident from previous studies, was investigated for different VOCs. Results:  Remdesivir showed promising results for B.1.351 variant (binding energy: -7.3  kcal/mol) with residues Gln319 and Val503 facilitating strong binding.  Favipiravir showed favorable results against B.1.1.7 (binding energy: -5.6  kcal/mol), B.1.351 (binding energy: -5.1 kcal/mol) and B.1.617.2 (binding energy:  -5 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulation for favipiravir/B.1.1.7 was conducted  and showed significant results in agreement with our findings. Conclusions: From  structural modeling and molecular docking experiments, it is evident that  mutations outside the receptor binding domain of surface glycoprotein do not have  a sharp impact on drug binding affinity. Thus, the potential use of these drugs  should be explored further for their antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.

AB  - Due to current advances and growing experience in the management of coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the outcome of COVID-19 patients with severe/critical  illness would be expected to be better in the second wave compared with the first  wave. As our hospitalization criteria changed in the second wave, we aimed to  investigate whether a favorable outcome occurred in hospitalized COVID-19  patients with only severe/critical illness. Among 642 laboratory-confirmed  hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the first wave and 1121 in the second wave,  those who met World Health Organization (WHO) definitions for severe or critical  illness on admission or during follow-up were surveyed. Data on demographics,  comorbidities, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on admission, and outcomes were  obtained from an electronic hospital database. Univariate analysis was performed  to compare the characteristics of patients in the first and second waves. There  were 228 (35.5%) patients with severe/critical illness in the first wave and 681  (60.7%) in the second wave. Both groups were similar in terms of age, gender, and  comorbidities, other than chronic kidney disease. Median serum CRP levels were  significantly higher in patients in the second wave compared with those in the  first wave [109 mg/L (interquartile range [IQR]: 65-157) vs. 87 mg/L (IQR:  39-140); p < 0.001]. However, intensive care unit admission and mortality rates  were similar among the waves. Even though a lower mortality rate in the second  wave has been reported in previous studies, including all hospitalized COVID-19  patients, we found similar demographics and outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19  patients with severe/critical illness in the first and second wave.

AB  - Introduction: Currently, there is no approved therapeutic entity for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and clinicians are primarily relying on drug repurposing.  However, findings across studies are widely disparate, making it difficult to  draw firm conclusions. Since clinicians need accurate evidence to treat COVID-19,  this manuscript systematically analyzed the published and ongoing studies  evaluating the pharmacological interventions for COVID-19.Areas Covered: A  systematic search of observational studies and Clinical Trials on the treatment  and prevention of COVID-19 was performed by using various databases from  inception to 2 December 2020.Expert Opinion: A total of 460 studies met the  inclusion criteria. Of these, 37 were research studies, 386 were ongoing trials,  and 37 were completed trials. Anti-virals, steroids, anti-malarial, plasma  exchange, and monoclonal antibodies were the most common treatment modalities  used alone or in combination in these studies. However, tocilizumab, plasma  exchange, and steroids have shown significant improvements in patient's clinical  and radiological status. Tocilizumab reported minimum hospital stay of 2 days  along with maximum recovery and patient's stability rate. Existing literature  demonstrate promising results of tocilizumab, plasma exchange, and steroids among  COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, these studies are accompanied by several  methodological disparities which should be considered while interpreting the  results.

AB  - The number of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly increased, although the WHO declared a  pandemic. However, drugs that function against SARS-CoV-2 have not been  established. SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme  2, the receptor of the SARS coronavirus. SARS coronavirus and coronavirus 229E,  the cause of the common cold, replicate through cell-surface and endosomal  pathways using a protease, the type II transmembrane protease. To examine the  effects of protease inhibitors on the replication of coronavirus 229E, we  pretreated primary cultures of human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells with camostat  or nafamostat, each of which has been used for the treatment of pancreatitis  and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation. HNE cells were then infected with  coronavirus 229E, and viral titers in the airway surface liquid of the cells were  examined. Pretreatment with camostat (0.1-10 μg/mL) or nafamostat (0.01-1 μg/mL)  reduced the titers of coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, a significant amount of type  II transmembrane protease protein was detected in the airway surface liquid of  HNE cells. Additionally, interferons have been reported to have antiviral effects  against SARS coronavirus. The additive effects of interferons on the inhibitory  effects of other candidate drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as  lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir, have also been studied. These findings  suggest that protease inhibitors of this type may inhibit coronavirus 229E  replication in human airway epithelial cells at clinical concentrations. Protease  inhibitors, interferons or the combination of these drugs may become candidate  drugs to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Drug repurposing is considered as a rapid strategy for COVID-19 drug discovery and many drugs have been tried for treatment of COVID-19. Antivirals like  favipiravir and remdesivir have become part of the COVID-19 Management Protocol  by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) as well as Maharashtra State  guidelines since beginning, after being approved by Drugs Controller General of  India (DCGI). Although these drugs have shown promising results, their efficacy  is still not proven completely and needs to be studied in large populations. The  purpose of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes in hospitalised  patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir and/or favipiravir. MATERIAL:  Retrospective analysis of medical records of 914 adult COVID-19 patients  hospitalized in a tertiary care center in Mumbai was conducted. We assessed the  following outcomes: severity of disease, need for oxygen supplementation,  incidence of complications, discharge from hospital or death, oxygen requirement  at the time of discharge, duration of hospital stay. These outcomes were compared  between patients who received remdesivir only, patients who received favipiravir  only, patients who received both remdesivir and favipiravir and patients who did  not receive either remdesivir or favipiravir (control group). OBSERVATION: Of  total 914 patients in our study, 55.79% patients received only remdesivir, 13.45%  received only favipiravir, 7.76% received remdesivir plus favipiravir and 22.97%  did not receive any antivirals. Higher number of patients in remdesivir only  group (60.19%) and remdesivir plus favipiravir groups (56.33%) required  supplemental oxygen [vs 32.38 % patients in control group and 24.39% in  favipiravir only group]. Highest number of patients (91.05%) in favipiravir only  group got discharged under Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines  closely followed by 88.73% in remdesivir plus favipiravir group, 88.43% in  remdesivir only group and 82.38 % patients in control group. 8.43% patients in  remdesivir only group, 6.5% in favipiravir only group, 7.04% in remdesivir plus  favipiravir group and 10.47 % patients in control group needed oxygen support  after discharge. CONCLUSION: Majority of patients in our study got discharged  under ICMR guidelines with higher proportion of patients in the treatment groups  as compared to the control group. Also, lesser number of patients in the  treatment groups required oxygen supplementation post discharge as compared to  the control group.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Retinal vascular complications have been described in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to analyze retinal  microvascular changes and their correlations with clinical findings. MATERIALS  AND METHODS: This case-controlled study was conducted in a university hospital.  The right eyes of 52 otherwise healthy patients recovered from COVID-19 and 42  healthy controls were examined with optical coherence tomography angiography.  Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare vessel density (VD) and foveal avascular  zone (FAZ) parameters. Associations with treatment choices, pneumonia, and  laboratory findings were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (56%) and 18  healthy controls (43%) were men. Mean age of the COVID-19 group was 39.00±13.04  years. Twenty-two patients had pneumonia, 18 (35%) received hydroxychloroquine  (HCQ), 17 (33%) received HCQ plus low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and 10  (19%) received favipiravir. The patient group had lower parafoveal VD in the  superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and lower parafoveal VD and perifoveal VD in  the deep capillary plexus (DCP) than controls (p=0.003, p=0.004, p=0.001). FAZ  area did not differ significantly (p=0.953). Perifoveal VD in the DCP was also  significantly lower in the HCQ+LMWH group than the HCQ group (p=0.020) and in the  presence of pneumonia (p=0.040). C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin levels  were negatively correlated with perifoveal VD in the DCP (r=-0.445, p=0.023;  r=-0.451, p=0.040). Ferritin was also negatively correlated with parafoveal VD in  the SCP (r=-0.532, p=0.013). CONCLUSION: Parafoveal and perifoveal VD was found  to be lower in the COVID-19 group. Presence of pneumonia, need for LMWH  prophylaxis, and levels of CRP and ferritin were found to be negatively  associated with retinal VD. Large-scale studies are needed to evaluate the  clinical importance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in December 2019. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) ranges from asymptomatic to severe and potentially fatal. We aimed to  describe the clinical and laboratory features and outcomes of hospitalised  patients with COVID-19 within the Abu Dhabi Healthcare Services Facilities  (SEHA). METHODS: Our retrospective analysis of patient data collected from  electronic health records (EHRs) available from the SEHA health information  system included all patients admitted from 1 March to 31 May 2020 with a  laboratory-confirmed PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data of clinical  features, co-morbidities, laboratory markers, length of hospital stay, treatment  received and mortality were analysed according to severe versus non-severe  disease. RESULTS: The study included 9390 patients. Patients were divided into  severe and non-severe groups. Seven hundred twenty-one (7.68%) patients required  intensive care, whereas the remaining patients (92.32%) had mild or moderate  disease. The mean patient age of our cohort (41.8 years) was lower than the  global average. Our population had male predominance, and it included various  nationalities. The major co-morbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus and  chronic kidney disease. Laboratory tests revealed significant differences in  lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and creatinine  levels and the neutrophil count between the severe and non-severe groups. The  most common anti-viral therapy was the combination of Hydroxychloroquine and  Favipiravir. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 1.63%, although the rate  was 19.56% in the severe group. The mortality rate was higher in adults younger  than 30 years than in those older than 60 years (2.3% vs. 0.95%). CONCLUSIONS:  Our analysis suggested that Abu Dhabi had lower COVID-19 morbidity and  mortalities rates were less than the reported rates then in China, Italy and the  US. The affected population was relatively young, and it had an international  representation. Globally, Abu Dhabi had one of the highest testing rates in  relation to the population volume. We believe the early identification of  patients and their younger age resulted in more favourable outcomes.

AB  - Immunocompromised populations are at great risk of the current 2020 global emergency of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and treatment of kidney  transplant recipients with COVID-19 is currently not declared. Hence, the purpose  of the study is to set a clear treatment regimen. We report here a therapeutic  course of 2 patients who underwent transplant surgery in March 2020 and got  infected soon after. Since the transplant, these 2 patients have received triple  maintenance immunosuppressive therapy with oral tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil  (MMF), and prednisone, and they have been regularly followed up at our hospital.  The tacrolimus trough level was between 10 and 12 ng/mL. After the diagnosis of  COVID-19, MMF was stopped and the tacrolimus dose was reduced so that blood level  was between 4 and 6 ng/mL. The first patient was a 30-year-old man who, despite  being treated with hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, oseltamivir, and azithromycin  therapy, died because of the presence of other comorbidities. The second case was  a 58-year-old man who fully recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia with treatment with  methylprednisolone, MMF, azithromycin, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, and  reduction in immunosuppression dosage. This reflects the importance of using  glucocorticoids in the treatment of COVID-19 along with other medications and the  decreased mortality rate associated with their use.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is considered as the most significant global public  health crisis of the century. Several drug candidates have been suggested as  potential therapeutic options for COVID-19, including remdesivir, currently the  only authorized drug for use under an Emergency Use Authorization. However, there  is only limited information regarding the safety profiles of the proposed drugs,  in particular drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Here, we evaluated the antiviral  activity and cardiotoxicity of remdesivir using cardiomyocytes-derived from human  pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CMs) as an alternative source of human primary  cardiomyocytes (CMs). In this study, remdesivir exhibited up to 60-fold higher  antiviral activity in hPSC-CMs compared to Vero E6 cells; however, it also  induced moderate cardiotoxicity in these cells. To gain further insight into the  drug-induced arrhythmogenic risk, we assessed QT interval prolongation and  automaticity of remdesivir-treated hPSC-CMs using a multielectrode array (MEA).  As a result, the data indicated a potential risk of QT prolongation when  remdesivir is used at concentrations higher than the estimated peak plasma  concentration. Therefore, we conclude that close monitoring of the  electrocardiographic/QT interval should be advised in SARS-CoV-2-infected  patients under remdesivir medication, in particular individuals with pre-existing  heart conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To present the struggle of a high volume liver transplant center against coronavirus infectious disease-2019 pandemic. METHODS: Between March 2020  and December 2020, the demographic and clinical data of staff and liver  transplant candidates diagnosed with coronavirus infectious disease-2019 in our  Liver Transplant Institute were prospectively analyzed. RESULTS: First, 32  healthcare staff were diagnosed with coronavirus infectious disease-2019, and 6  of them were surgeons. Six staff were asymptomatic, while 24 staff had mild or  moderate and 2 staff had severe coronavirus infectious disease-2019. All the  staff recovered from the disease without any permanent sequela and returned to  duty after 2 consecutive negative polymerase chain reaction results within  24-hour intervals. Second, during the preoperative investigation, 6 living liver  donor candidates and 13 recipients were tested positive for coronavirus  infectious disease-2019 (son = 6, unrelated = 3, cousin = 3, daughter = 2,  cadaveric = 1). Eleven patients received favipiravir and 8 did not receive any  treatment because they were asymptomatic. Only one recipient who had severe  coronavirus infectious disease-2019 died due to multiple organ failure syndrome.  One recipient died in the early postoperative period. The median duration from  the initial diagnosis of the patients till the transplant procedure was 21 days  (min-max: 14-105 days). During the time of operation, the polymerase chain  reaction tests of the donors and the recipients were negative, and the thorax  tomography images showed no signs of viral pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Meticulous  precautions, multidisciplinary approach, team effort, and organization of  facilities can increase the quality of care of these patients in the coronavirus  infectious disease-2019 era. Healthcare workers have shown tremendous effort and  are the true heroes of this era.

AB  - COVID-19 is a fast-spreading pandemic that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogen. Combination therapy of the antiviral favipiravir and the anticoagulant  apixaban is one of the efficient treatment regimens. Therefore, development of  novel and sensitive methods for simultaneous analysis of such combination is  highly advantageous. Herein, two eco-friendly, simple, rapid, and cost-effective  spectrofluorometric methods were evolved for the estimation of favipiravir and  apixaban in pharmaceutical and biological matrices. Method I was based on  analysis of favipiravir and apixaban by the first-order derivative of the  conventional fluorescence spectra obtained after excitation at 300 nm, where  favipiravir and apixaban were detected at 468.8 and 432.0 nm, respectively.  Method II relied on dual scan synchronous spectrofluorometry, in which  favipiravir was determined at 364 nm using Δλ = 60 nm while apixaban was analyzed  at 274 nm using Δλ = 200 nm. Method optimization was performed for selecting the  optimum conditions at which maximum sensitivity and selectivity were obtained.  This report is the first one that describes simultaneous analysis of favipiravir  and apixaban by synchronous spectrofluorometry. The developed methods were  successfully applied to evaluate favipiravir and apixaban in spiked human plasma  and in pharmaceutical dosages with high %recoveries and low RSD.

AB  - Nanomedicine-based and unmodified drug interventions to address COVID-19 have evolved over the course of the pandemic as more information is gleaned and virus  variants continue to emerge. For example, some early therapies (e.g., antibodies)  have experienced markedly decreased efficacy. Due to a growing concern of future  drug resistant variants, current drug development strategies are seeking to find  effective drug combinations. In this study, we used IDentif.AI, an artificial  intelligence-derived platform, to investigate the drug-drug and drug-dose  interaction space of six promising experimental or currently deployed therapies  at various concentrations: EIDD-1931, YH-53, nirmatrelvir, AT-511, favipiravir,  and auranofin. The drugs were tested in vitro against a live B.1.1.529 (Omicron)  virus first in monotherapy and then in 50 strategic combinations designed to  interrogate the interaction space of 729 possible combinations. Key findings and  interactions were then further explored and validated in an additional  experimental round using an expanded concentration range. Overall, we found that  few of the tested drugs showed moderate efficacy as monotherapies in the  actionable concentration range, but combinatorial drug testing revealed  significant dose-dependent drug-drug interactions, specifically between EIDD-1931  and YH-53, as well as nirmatrelvir and YH-53. Checkerboard validation analysis  confirmed these synergistic interactions and also identified an interaction  between EIDD-1931 and favipiravir in an expanded range. Based on the platform  nature of IDentif.AI, these findings may support further explorations of the  dose-dependent drug interactions between different drug classes in further  pre-clinical and clinical trials as possible combinatorial therapies consisting  of unmodified and nanomedicine-enabled drugs, to combat current and future  COVID-19 strains and other emerging pathogens.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly and poses an unprecedented threat to the global economy and human health. Broad-spectrum antivirals are currently being  administered to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2). China's prevention and treatment guidelines suggest the use of an  anti-influenza drug, arbidol, for the clinical treatment of COVID-19. Reports  indicate that arbidol could neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Monotherapy with arbidol is  superior to lopinavir-ritonavir or favipiravir for treating COVID-19. In  SARS-CoV-2 infection, arbidol acts by interfering with viral binding to host  cells. However, the detailed mechanism by which arbidol induces the inhibition of  SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Here, we present atomistic insights into the mechanism  underlying membrane fusion inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by arbidol. Molecular  dynamics (MD) simulation-based analyses demonstrate that arbidol binds and  stabilizes at the receptor-binding domain (RBD)/ACE2 interface with a high  affinity. It forms stronger intermolecular interactions with the RBD than ACE2.  Analyses of the detailed decomposition of energy components and binding  affinities revealed a substantial increase in the affinity between the RBD and  ACE2 in the arbidol-bound RBD/ACE2 complex, suggesting that arbidol generates  favorable interactions between them. Based on our MD simulation results, we  propose that the binding of arbidol induces structural rigidity in the viral  glycoprotein, thus restricting the conformational rearrangements associated with  membrane fusion and virus entry. Furthermore, key residues of the RBD and ACE2  that interact with arbidol were identified, opening the door for developing  therapeutic strategies and higher-efficacy arbidol derivatives or lead drug  candidates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Favipiravir, an oral, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, has in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2). Despite limited data, favipiravir is administered to patients with  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in several countries. METHODS: We conducted a  phase 2, double-blind, randomized controlled outpatient trial of favipiravir in  asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2  reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) within 72 hours of  enrollment. Participants were randomized to receive placebo or favipiravir  (1800 mg twice daily [BID] day 1, 800 mg BID days 2-10). The primary outcome was  SARS-CoV-2 shedding cessation in a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) cohort of  participants with positive enrollment RT-PCRs. Using SARS-CoV-2 amplicon-based  sequencing, we assessed favipiravir's impact on mutagenesis. RESULTS: We  randomized 149 participants with 116 included in the mITT cohort. The  participants' mean age was 43 years (standard deviation, 12.5 years) and 57 (49%)  were women. We found no difference in time to shedding cessation overall (hazard  ratio [HR], 0.76 favoring placebo [95% confidence interval {CI}, .48-1.20]) or in  subgroups (age, sex, high-risk comorbidities, seropositivity, or symptom duration  at enrollment). We detected no difference in time to symptom resolution (initial:  HR, 0.84 [95% CI, .54-1.29]; sustained: HR, 0.87 [95% CI, .52-1.45]) and no  difference in transition mutation accumulation in the viral genome during  treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support favipiravir at commonly used  doses in outpatients with uncomplicated COVID-19. Further research is needed to  ascertain if higher favipiravir doses are effective and safe for patients with  COVID-19. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT04346628.

AB  - Since a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in late December 2019, coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19) epidemic has gradually spread worldwide, becoming a major  public health event. No specific antivirals are currently available for COVID-19  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The  treatments for COVID-19 are mainly based on the experiences of similar virus such  SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HIV and influenza viruses. Scientists have taken great  efforts to investigate the effective methods for the treatment of COVID-19. Up to  now, there are over 1000 clinical studies for COVID-19 all over the world. In  this article, we reviewed the current options for COVID-19 therapy including  small molecules such as Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir etc, peptide  inhibitors of ACE2, Traditional Chinese Medicines and Biologics such as  SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies, mesenchymal stem cells and vaccines  etc. Meanwhile, we systematically reviewed their clinical safety, clinical  applications and progress of antiviral researches. The therapeutic effect of  these antiviral drugs is summarized and compared, hoping to provide some ideas  for clinical options of COVID-19 treatment and also provide experiences for the  life-threatening virus diseases in the future.

AB  - The objective of this retrospective study was to identify the clinical risk factor associated with uric acid elevation in coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  patients treated with favipiravir. Uric acid elevation was defined as an  unexplained increase of ≥1.5 times in the patient's uric acid level from  baseline. Twenty-nine COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Uric acid  elevation developed during favipiravir therapy in 12 (41.4%) patients and the  median onset time was 4.5 days after starting favipiravir. In multiple logistic  regression analysis, the favipiravir dosage (adjusted OR = 1.69 [1.02-2.81],  P = 0.044) and younger patient age (adjusted OR = 0.91 [0.83-0.99], P = 0.040)  were significant clinical risk factors for uric acid elevation. No significant  between-group difference was noted in the uric acid elevation and non-elevation  groups in the clinical recovery after favipiravir therapy. The uric acid levels  of patients administered with favipiravir should be monitored closely.

AB  - Although some patients with COVID-19 develop only mild symptoms, fatal complications have been observed among those with comorbidities. As patients with  cancer are immunocompromised, they are thought to have a high risk of severe  illness associated with COVID-19. We report a COVID-19 patient with adult T-cell  leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) who was treated using favipiravir. A 69-year-old woman  with lymphoma-type ATL was treated using cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,  vincristine, prednisolone and mogamulizumab (M-CHOP) with substantial efficacy.  However, in cycle 4 of M-CHOP therapy, she developed fever with mild cough. The  patient was admitted to the hospital and CT revealed bilateral ground-glass  opacities. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR and the patient was diagnosed with  COVID-19. Considering severe immunosuppression caused by ATL, we initiated  favipiravir therapy. Subsequently, the fever improved without antipyretics and  her C-reactive protein level decreased rapidly. SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were  negative on days 17 and 18 of favipiravir therapy, and the patient was discharged  without residual disease on the final CT. This is the first documented case of  COVID-19 in a patient with ATL. Although severe immunosuppression caused by ATL  was present, severe COVID-19 pneumonia did not develop. The immunosuppressed  condition caused by hematological malignancy may not always be a risk factor for  severe illness associated with COVID-19. Further accumulation of data regarding  COVID-19 in patients with hematological malignancies is warranted to clarify the  risk factors for severe illness, the best-in-class antiviral agent, and the  optimal treatment strategy in this population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Favipiravir is an antiviral that is being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19. Use of favipiravir is associated with elevation of serum uric acid  levels. Risk factors for the occurrence of hyperuricemia are unclear. METHODS:  Specimens from COVID-19 patients who received 10 days of favipiravir in a  previous clinical trial (jRCTs041190120) were used. Serum favipiravir  concentrations were measured by LC-MS. Factors associated with the development of  hyperuricemia were investigated using logistic regression analysis. Optimal  cut-off values for the baseline serum uric acid levels and steady-state serum  favipiravir concentrations in predicting the occurrence of hyperuricemia were  determined by ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: Among the 66 COVID-19 patients who  were treated with favipiravir for 10 days, the steady-state serum favipiravir  concentrations were significantly correlated with serum uric acid levels. High  baseline serum uric acid levels and steady-state serum favipiravir concentrations  during therapy were factors associated with the development of hyperuricemia. The  cut‑off baseline serum uric acid level and steady-state serum favipiravir  concentration during favipiravir administration determined to predict  hyperuricemia were 3.7 mg/dL and 46.14 μg/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients  with high baseline serum uric acid levels or who achieved high steady-state serum  favipiravir concentrations during therapy were susceptible to hyperuricemia.

AB  - A 42-year-old man exhibiting hypoxia was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. He had medical histories of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, and  gout attack. He received favipiravir for compassionate use for 14 days.  Subsequently, he showed increased uric acid levels and developed acute gouty  arthritis. Favipiravir may induce not only hyperuricemia but also acute gouty  arthritis. It should therefore be used with caution in patients with a history of  gout and those with hyperuricemia, especially when used at a higher dose and for  a longer duration than is typical.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a major problem in the world right now. Currently, all the attention of research centers and governments globally are focused on the  investigation of vaccination studies and the discovery of small molecules that  inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the treatment of patients. The goal of this study  was to locate small molecules to be used against COVID19 instead of favipiravir.  Favipiravir analogues were selected as drug candidates from the PubChem web tool.  The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein was selected as the target  protein as favipiravir inhibits this protein in the human body. Initially, the  inhibition activity of the studied compounds against RdRp of different virus  types was investigated. Then, the inhibition properties of selected drug  candidates and favipiravir were examined in detail against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp  proteins. It was found that 2-oxo-1H-pyrazine-3-carboxamide performed better than  favipiravir in the results of molecular docking, molecular mechanics  Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PSBA) calculations, and ADME  analyses.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - AIMS: It is aimed to investigate the disease processes and drug combinations in patients who received favipiravir treatment. METHODS: This cross-sectional,  analytical and retrospective study included all patients aged ≥18 years (n = 502)  who were hospitalised in Samsun, Turkey, for COVID-19 and were given favipiravir  from the date between 25 March 2020 and 3 June 2020. RESULTS: In total, 58.6%  (n = 294) of the patients were male and 24.5% (n = 123) were between the ages of  71 and 80 years. During the first case process, the mortality rate was 19.9%,  whereas the rate of those who were discharged as is/followed up at home for  14 days was 37.3%. During the second case process, the mortality rate was 6.2%,  and the rate of those who was discharged as is/followed up at home for 14 days  was 65.6%. The mean length of hospital stay was 10.61 ± 8.17 days for the first  and 7.97 ± 4.16 days for the second hospitalisation; this difference was  significant. Mortality risk of those who used Tocilizumab or vitamin C beside  Favipiravir was higher than those who did not. The length of hospital stay was  higher in patients using tocilizumab than in those who did not (P < .001).  CONCLUSION: Administration of favipiravir later in the course of the disease  makes it difficult to achieve the true efficacy expected from the drug and also  makes it difficult for other combination drugs to contribute to survival.  Favipiravir may also be effective in case of recurrence.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to Afyonkarahisar Health Sciences University, Afyonkarahisar,  Turkey, and to determine the factors affecting mortality. METHODS: A total of 500  patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between 19th of March and 30th of  September 2020 in Afyonkarahisar Health Sciences University, Faculty of Medicine,  Pandemic Service, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey, were retrospectively investigated for  this study. These individuals' prognoses, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and  radiological information were examined and recorded retrospectively. Comparisons  were carried out between the characteristics of patients with a prognosis of  death and those who recovered. RESULTS: Of the 500 definite COVID-19 cases  included in the study, 53.8% were male and the mean age was 57.6±15.1 (18-88  years). The most common comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. A  total of 45 (9%) patients developed mortality. Factors such as advanced age, male  gender, shortness of breath, fever at admission, comorbid conditions such as  hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, lymphopenia, high  C-reactive protein, high D-dimer, and high ferritin in the laboratory were found  to be important risk factors for mortality. Treatments such as  hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir were not found to have  lower mortality rates than one another. CONCLUSION: Considering these elements  when assessing patients and adjusting the course of treatment according to the  recommendations of the most recent guidelines may lower mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Favipiravir has discrepant activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, concerns about teratogenicity and pill burden, and an unknown optimal dose. This  analysis used available data to simulate the intracellular pharmacokinetics of  the favipiravir active metabolite [favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate  (FAVI-RTP)]. METHODS: Published in vitro data for intracellular production and  elimination of FAVI-RTP in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were fitted with a  mathematical model describing the time course of intracellular FAVI-RTP as a  function of favipiravir concentration. Parameter estimates were then combined  with a published population pharmacokinetic model in Chinese patients to predict  human intracellular FAVI-RTP. In vitro FAVI-RTP data were adequately described as  a function of concentrations with an empirical model, noting simplification and  consolidation of various processes and several assumptions. RESULTS: Parameter  estimates from fittings to in vitro data predict a flatter dynamic range of peak  to trough for intracellular FAVI-RTP (peak to trough ratio of ∼1 to 1) when  driven by a predicted free plasma concentration profile, compared with the plasma  profile of parent favipiravir (ratio of ∼2 to 1). This approach has important  assumptions, but indicates that, despite rapid clearance of the parent from  plasma, sufficient intracellular FAVI-RTP may be maintained across the dosing  interval because of its long intracellular half-life. CONCLUSIONS: Population  mean intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations are estimated to be maintained above  the Km for the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase for 9 days with a 1200 mg twice-daily  regimen (following a 1600 mg twice-daily loading dose on day 1). Further  evaluation of favipiravir as part of antiviral combinations for SARS-CoV-2 is  warranted.

AB  - Efforts to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic include the screening of existing antiviral molecules that could be repurposed to treat  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Although  SARS-CoV-2 replicates and propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney  (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) often show  decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. SARS-CoV-2  exhibits low viability in human cells in culture. Here, serial passages of a  SARS-CoV-2 isolate (original-SARS2) in the human hepatoma cell clone Huh7.5 led  to the selection of a variant (adapted-SARS2) with significantly improved  infectivity in human liver (Huh7 and Huh7.5) and lung cancer (unmodified Calu-1  and A549) cells. The adapted virus exhibited mutations in the spike protein,  including a 9-amino-acid deletion and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and  Q954H). E484D also emerged in Vero E6-cultured viruses that became viable in A549  cells. Original and adapted viruses were susceptible to scavenger receptor class  B type 1 (SR-B1) receptor blocking, and adapted-SARS2 exhibited significantly  less dependence on ACE2. Both variants were similarly neutralized by COVID-19  convalescent-phase plasma, but adapted-SARS2 exhibited increased susceptibility  to exogenous type I interferon. Remdesivir inhibited original- and adapted-SARS2  similarly, demonstrating the utility of the system for the screening of NUCs.  Among the tested NUCs, only remdesivir, molnupiravir, and, to a limited extent,  galidesivir showed antiviral effects across human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir,  ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity. Analogously to the emergence  of spike mutations in vivo, the spike protein is under intense adaptive selection  pressure in cell culture. Our results indicate that the emergence of spike  mutations will most likely not affect the activity of remdesivir.

AB  - Sotrovimab, an anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 monoclonal antibody is being utilized to prevent progression of coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19). Therefore, to understand its benefits, we have conducted a  retrospective analysis of all non-hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19  who received a single infusion of sotrovimab and/or oral favipiravir at any Dubai  COVID-19 related healthcare center between July 1, 2021, and October 31, 2021.  The main outcome was to evaluate the risk of hospitalization for patients with  COVID-19 or all-cause death within 28 days of treatment initiation. In this  analysis, which included 10,882 patients (1,135 in the sotrovimab group, 2,653 in  the sotrovimab/favipiravir group, and 7,094 in the favipiravir group), sotrovimab  or sotrovimab/favipiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization (13 patients (1.5%)  in the sotrovimab group and 71 patients (2.9%) in the sotrovimab/favipiravir  group vs. 251 patients (4%) in the favipiravir group; hazard ratio (HR) for  sotrovimab: 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09-0.28, P < 0.001; and for  sotrovimab/favipiravir, HR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.32-0.56, P < 0.001), or death by day  28 from the start of treatment (no death in the sotrovimab group and 2 deaths in  the the sotrovimab/favipiravir group vs. 10 deaths in the favipiravir group; odds  ratio: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.81, P = 026). Safety was assessed in all the 3,788  patients in the sotrovimab and sotrovimab/favipiravir groups, and the reported  adverse events were by 34 patients (<1%). In conclusion, sotrovimab was found to  reduce the risk of progression of COVID-19 when administrated early to  non-hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19. No safety concern was  detected.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of favipiravir on the QTc interval during the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is unclear. Thus, the current study  objective was to evaluate any change in the QTc interval in patients who were  hospitalized due to COVID-19 receiving favipiravir treatment. METHOD: Patients  hospitalized with COVID-19 were assessed in this single-center retrospective  study. 189 patients, whose diagnosis was confirmed using real-time PCR, were  included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups: those using  hydroxychloroquine (Group 1, n = 66), hydroxychloroquine plus favipiravir (Group  2, n = 66), and favipiravir only (Group 3, n = 57). The QTc interval was measured  before treatment (QTc-B) and 48 h after (i.e., the median) starting treatment  (QTc-AT). RESULTS: The median age was 53 (39-66 IQR) and 97 (51%) of patients  were female. The median QTc(Bazett)-change was 7 ms (p = 0.028) and 12 ms  (p < 0.001) and in Group 1 and 2, respectively. In Group 3, the median  QTc(Bazett)-change was observed as -3 ms and was not statistically significant  (p = 0.247). In multivariable analysis, while there was a significant  relationship between QTc-AT(Bazett) and hydroxychloroquine (β coefficient = 2687,  95%CI 2599-16,976, p = 0,008), there was no significant relationship with  favipiravir (β coefficient = 0,180, 95% CI -6435-7724, p = 0,858). Similarly,  there was a significant relationship between the QTc-AT interval calculated using  the Fredericia formula and hydroxychloroquine (β coefficient = 2120, 95% CI  0,514-14,398, p = 0,035), but not with favipiravir (β coefficient = 0,111, 95% CI  -6450- 7221, p = 0,911). CONCLUSION: In the ECG recordings received in the  following days after the treatment was started in COVID-19 patients, there was a  significant prolongation in the QTc interval with hydroxychloroquine, but there  was no significant change with favipiravir.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that hit the world in 2020 triggered a massive dissemination of information (an "infodemic") about the  disease that was channeled through the print, broadcast, web, and social media.  This infodemic also included sensational and distorted information about drugs  that likely first influenced opinion leaders and people particularly active on  social media and then other people, thus affecting choices by individual patients  everywhere. In particular, information has spread about some drugs approved for  other indications (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II  receptor antagonists, favipiravir, and umifenovir) that could have led to  inappropriate and therefore hazardous use. In this article, we analyze the  rationale behind the claims for use of these drugs in COVID-19, the communication  about their effects on the disease, the consequences of this communication on  people's behavior, and the responses of some influential regulatory authorities  in an attempt to minimize the actual or potential risks arising from this  behavior. Finally, we discuss the role of pharmacovigilance stakeholders in  emergency management and possible strategies to deal with other similar crises in  the future.

AB  - Originating in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019, COVID-19 has emerged now as a global health emergency with a high number of deaths worldwide. COVID-19  is caused by a novel coronavirus, referred to as severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in pandemic conditions around the  globe. We are in the battleground to fight against the virus by rapidly  developing therapeutic strategies in tackling SARS-CoV-2 and saving human lives  from COVID-19. Scientists are evaluating several known drugs either for the  pathogen or the host; however, many of them are reported to be associated with  side effects. In the present study, we report the molecular binding mechanisms of  the natural alkaloid, noscapine, for repurposing against the main protease of  SARS-CoV-2, a key enzyme involved in its reproduction. We performed the molecular  dynamics (MD) simulation in an explicit solvent to investigate the molecular  mechanisms of noscapine for stable binding and conformational changes to the main  protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. The drug repurposing study revealed the high  potential of noscapine and proximal binding to the Mpro enzyme in a comparative  binding pattern analyzed with chloroquine, ribavirin, and favipiravir. Noscapine  binds closely to binding pocket-3 of the Mpro enzyme and depicted stable binding  with RMSD 0.1-1.9 Å and RMSF profile peak conformational fluctuations at 202-306  residues, and a Rg score ranging from 21.9 to 22.4 Å. The MM/PB (GB) SA  calculation landscape revealed the most significant contribution in terms of  binding energy with ΔPB -19.08 and ΔGB -27.17 kcal/mol. The electrostatic energy  distribution in MM energy was obtained to be -71.16 kcal/mol and depicted high  free energy decomposition (electrostatic energy) at 155-306 residues (binding  pocket-3) of Mpro by a MM force field. Moreover, the dynamical residue  cross-correlation map also stated that the high pairwise correlation occurred at  binding residues 200-306 of the Mpro enzyme (binding pocket-3) with noscapine.  Principal component analysis depicted the enhanced movement of protein atoms with  a high number of static hydrogen bonds. The obtained binding results of noscapine  were also well correlated with the pharmacokinetic parameters of antiviral drugs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected 86,4 M patients and  resulted in 1,86 M deaths worldwide. Severe COVID-19 patients have elevated blood  levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, IL-8 and  interferon (IFN)γ. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of antiviral treatment  serum cytokines in severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Blood was obtained from 29  patients (aged 32-79 yr) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 upon admission and  7 days after antiviral (Favipiravir or Lopinavir/Ritonavir) treatment. Patients  also received standard supportive treatment in this retrospective observational  study. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated to investigate lung  manifestations of COVID-19. Serum was also obtained and cytokines levels were  evaluated. 19 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were studied. RESULTS:  Anti-viral therapy significantly reduced CT scan scores and the elevated serum  levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In contrast,  serum levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IFNγ were elevated at baseline in COVID-19  subjects compared to healthy subjects with IL-6 (p = 0.006) and IL-8 (p = 0.011)  levels being further elevated after antiviral therapy. IL-1β (p = 0.01) and TNFα  (p = 0.069) levels were also enhanced after treatment but baseline levels were  similar to those of healthy controls. These changes occurred irrespective of  whether patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Antiviral  treatments did not suppress the inflammatory phase of COVID-19 after 7 days  treatment although CT, CRP and LDH suggest a decline in lung inflammation. There  was limited evidence for a viral-mediated cytokine storm in these COVID-19  subjects.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader, which removes nucleotide inhibitors such as Remdesivir that are incorporated into the viral RNA during  replication, reducing the efficacy of these drugs for treating COVID-19.  Combinations of inhibitors of both the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the  exonuclease could overcome this deficiency. Here we report the identification of  hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitors Pibrentasvir and Ombitasvir as SARS-CoV-2  exonuclease inhibitors. In the presence of Pibrentasvir, RNAs terminated with the  active forms of the prodrugs Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir  and AT-527 were largely protected from excision by the exonuclease, while in the  absence of Pibrentasvir, there was rapid excision. Due to its unique structure,  Tenofovir-terminated RNA was highly resistant to exonuclease excision even in the  absence of Pibrentasvir. Viral cell culture studies also demonstrate significant  synergy using this combination strategy. This study supports the use of  combination drugs that inhibit both the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and exonuclease for  effective COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - Since the first case reports in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic and took lives of > 8,35,000 people globally. This single-stranded RNA  virus uses Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry into  the host cell. Overexpression of ACE2 is mainly observed in hypertensive,  diabetic and heart patients that make them prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Mitigations strategies were opted globally by the governments to minimize  transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the implementation of social distancing norms,  wearing the facemasks, and spreading awareness using digital platforms. The lack  of an approved drug treatment regimen, and non-availability of a vaccine,  collectively posed a challenge for mankind to fight against the SARS-CoV-2  pandemic. In this scenario, repurposing of existing drugs and old treatment  options like convalescent plasma therapy can be one of the potential alternatives  to treat the disease. The drug repurposing provides a selection of drugs based on  the scientific rationale and with a shorter cycle of clinical trials, while  plasma isolated from COVID-19 recovered patients can be a good source of  neutralizing antibody to provide passive immunity. In this review, we provide  in-depth analysis on these two approaches currently opted all around the world to  treat COVID-19 patients. For this, we used "Boolean Operators" such as AND, OR &  NOT to search relevant research articles/reviews from the PUBMED for the  repurposed drugs and the convalescent plasma in the COVID-19 treatment. The  repurposed drugs like Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Tenofovir, Remdesivir,  Ribavirin, Darunavir, Oseltamivir, Arbidol (Umifenovir), Favipiravir, Anakinra,  and Baricitinib are already being used in clinical trials to treat the COVID-19  patients. These drugs have been approved for a different indication and belong to  a diverse category such as anti-malarial/anti-parasitic,  anti-retroviral/anti-viral, anti-cancer, or against rheumatoid arthritis.  Although, the vaccine would be an ideal option for providing active immunity  against the SARS-CoV-2, but considering the current situation, drug repurposing  and convalescent plasma therapy and repurposed drugs are the most viable option  against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Despite the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has been going on for over 5 months, there is yet to be a standard management policy for all patients  including those with mild-to-moderate cases. We evaluated the role of early  hospitalization in combination with early antiviral therapy with COVID-19  patients in a tertiary care university hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was  a prospective, observational, single-center study on probable/confirmed COVID-19  patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital on COVID-19 wards between March  20 and April 30, 2020. The demographic, laboratory, and clinical data were  collected. RESULTS: We included 174 consecutive probable/confirmed COVID-19 adult  patients hospitalized in the Internal Medicine wards of the University Adult  Hospital between March 20 and April 30, 2020. The median age was 45.5 (19–92)  years and 91 patients (52.3%) were male. One hundred and twenty (69%) were  confirmed microbiologically, 41 (23.5%) were radiologically diagnosed, and 13  (7.5%) were clinically suspected (negative microbiological and radiological  findings compatible with COVID-19); 35 (20.1%) had mild, 107 (61.5%) moderate  disease, and 32 (18.4%) had severe pneumonia. Out of 171 cases, 130 (74.3%)  showed pneumonia; 80 were typical, and 50 showed indeterminate infiltration for  COVID-19. Patients were admitted within a median of 3 days (0-14 days) after  symptoms appear. The median duration of hospitalization was 4 days (0-28 days).  In this case series, 13.2% patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine alone,  64.9% with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 18.4% with regimens  including favipiravir. A total of 15 patients (8.5%) were transferred to the ICU.  Four patients died (2.2%). CONCLUSION: In our series, 174 patients were admitted  to the hospital wards for COVID-19, 69% were confirmed with PCR and/or antibody  test. At the time of admission, nearly one fifth of the patients had severe  diseases. Of the patients, 95.4% received hydroxychloroquine alone or in  combination. The overall case fatality rate was 2.2%.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a coronavirus-based infectious illness that was first detected at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China. The novel virus induces severe acute  respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and has spread globally, resulting in an  ongoing pandemic. There is still a lack of evidence for direct comparison of  favipiravir therapy. Network meta-analysis (NMA), may incorporate direct and  indirect comparisons in a pooled computation while depending on strong  assumptions and premises. This study provides evidence-based recommendations on  the safety of currently used clinical pharmacological treatments compared to  favipiravir for COVID-19 patients. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a systematic review  and Bayesian NMA. We searched the primary databases and clinical trials center  for reports of short-term, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of favipiravir for  COVID-19 treatment. The primary endpoints here considered were any adverse events  observed or reported during the treatment cycle with estimates of odds ratio (OR)  and 95% confidence interval (CI), until November 6, 2021. RESULTS: Between  January 2020 and July 2021, 908 individuals were randomly assigned to one of the  seven active prescription medication regimens or placebo in this study,  generating seven direct comparisons on 12 data points. The safety of favipiravir  over the four clinically efficacious monotherapies or combinations including  tocilizumab, arbidol, lopinavir + ritonavir, and chloroquine remained unknown due  to the lack of a significant difference and the limited sample size. CONCLUSIONS:  Overall, comparative rankings could assist doctors and guideline developers in  decision-making. We have also concluded that the safety of favipiravir requires  further attention.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of patients who registered at the Siriraj Favipiravir Clinic and to share our experiences in this  comparatively unique clinical setting. This retrospective study included patients  who registered at the Siriraj Favipiravir Clinic during August 11, 2021 to  September 14, 2021. Included adult patients were those with severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19])  infection confirmed by antigen test kit (ATK) or real-time reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction, no favipiravir contraindication, no  prior COVID-19 treatment, and not receiving care from another medical facility.  Demographic data and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Of the 1168 patients  (mean age: 44.8 ± 16.4 years, 55.7% female) who registered at the clinic, 117  (10%) did not meet the treatment criteria, and 141 (12%) patients did not pick up  their medication. One-third of patients had at least 1 symptom that indicated  severe disease. Higher proportion of unvaccinated status (56.7% vs 47.5%, P =  .005), higher proportion of persons with risk factors for disease progression  (37.7% vs 31.3%, P = .028), and longer duration between the date of clinic  registration and the date of positive diagnostic test (3 vs 2 days, P = .004)  were significantly more commonly observed in the severe disease group compared to  the nonsevere disease group. The duration between symptom onset and the date of  clinic registration was significantly longer in the real-time reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction group than in the ATK group (6 vs 4 days,  P < .001). Most patients (90.0%) had completed favipiravir treatment regimen. The  improvement and mortality rates were 86.7% and 1.2%, respectively. COVID-19  severity is associated with vaccination status, baseline risk factors, and timing  between disease detection and treatment. The use of ATK influences patients to  seek treatment significantly earlier in ambulatory setting. Our early diagnosis  and antiviral treatment strategy yielded favorable results in an outpatient  setting during a COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand.

AB  - Favipiravir, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine have been suggested in COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel of many countries. Synchronous spectrofluorometric  measurement provides sensitive tool for resolving the overlapped spectra of  multicomponent drugs through converting the wider spectra to narrower sharp  spectra. This work introduces the first fluorescence spectroscopic method for  quantitative analysis of favipiravir, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine in spiked  human plasma. Testing the fluorescence spectra of favipiravir, remdesivir and  hydroxychloroquine shows severe overlap, which hinders the direct quantification  of the cited drugs. To overcome the overlapping issue, the drugs under the study  have been measured in the synchronous mode at Δλ = 60 nm. Favipiravir could be  measured directly at 423 nm without interference of remdesivir or  hydroxychloroquine. Synchronous measuring the cited drugs at Δλ = 130 nm with  mathematical transforming to the first order derivative spectra allowing  remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine at 384 nm and 394 nm, respectively without  interference from favipiravir. Different factors affecting the  spectrofluorometric measurement process have been verified. The drugs under the  study have been successfully quantitatively analyzed in the spiked plasma using  the proposed method.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China, in mid-December 2019, and declared a  pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. Due to the unknown nature of the disease  and the lack of specific drugs, several potential treatments were used for  patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate studies of the  effects of favipiravir in COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will  search electronic databases including LitCovid hub, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of  Sciences, Cochrane and Embase using keywords related to COVID-19 and favipiravir.  We will search the reference lists of all included studies and reviews. We will  also search for clinical trial registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, for the  ongoing clinical trials. All randomised clinical trials investigating the safety  and efficacy of favipiravir compared with other control groups for the treatment  of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 will be included. Patients'  survival at the end of the treatment as well as the follow-up will be the primary  outcome of the treatment, followed by the time and rate of the patient with a  negative COVID-19 test. The desired secondary outcome will consist of a decreased  rate of symptoms, proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) transfers, length of  the hospital stay, ICU treatments, the quality of life and additional adverse  events. Data synthesis will be conducted using CMA V.2. Two independent  investigators will be screening titles, abstracts and full texts of included  studies, based on eligibility criteria. These investigators will then  independently extract the data and appraise the quality of said studies. All  potential discrepancies will be resolved through consultation with the third  reviewer. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard I(2) test.  A funnel plot, Egger's test and Begg's test will be used for detecting asymmetry  to explore possible publication bias. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All findings of  this systematic review and meta-analysis will help identify the safety and  efficacy of favipiravir for patients with COVID-19. Given that the design of the  study is a systematic review, there is no need to follow the code of ethics  protocol. The results of this study will be published in a reputable journal.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide since December 2019, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although  vaccines for this virus have been developed rapidly, repurposing drugs approved  to treat other diseases remains an invaluable treatment strategy. Here, we  evaluated the inhibitory effects of drugs on SARS-CoV-2 replication in a hamster  infection model and in in vitro assays. Favipiravir significantly suppressed  virus replication in hamster lungs. Remdesivir inhibited virus replication in  vitro, but was not effective in the hamster model. However, GS-441524, a  metabolite of remdesivir, effectively suppressed virus replication in hamsters.  Co-administration of favipiravir and GS-441524 more efficiently reduced virus  load in hamster lungs than did single administration of either drug for both the  prophylactic and therapeutic regimens; prophylactic co-administration also  efficiently inhibited lung inflammation in the infected animals. Furthermore,  pretreatment of hamsters with favipiravir and GS-441524 effectively protected  them from virus transmission via respiratory droplets upon exposure to infected  hamsters. Repurposing and co-administration of antiviral drugs may help combat  COVID-19. IMPORTANCE During a pandemic, repurposing drugs that are approved for  other diseases is a quick and realistic treatment option. In this study, we found  that co-administration of favipiravir and the remdesivir metabolite GS-441524  more effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs of Syrian hamsters  than either favipiravir or GS-441524 alone as part of a prophylactic or  therapeutic regimen. Prophylactic co-administration also reduced the severity of  lung inflammation. Moreover, co-administration of these drugs to naive hamsters  efficiently protected them from airborne transmission of the virus from infected  animals. Since both drugs are nucleotide analogs that interfere with the  RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of many RNA viruses, these findings may also help  encourage co-administration of antivirals to combat future pandemics.

AB  - Initial case series of small number of patients at the beginning of the pandemic reported a rather guarded prognosis for Behçet's syndrome (BS) patients infected  with SARS-CoV-2. In this prospective study, we describe the incidence, clinical  characteristics, disease course, management, and outcome in a large cohort of BS  patients with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2. We defined a cohort  of 1047 registered BS patients who were aged between 16 and 60 years and seen  routinely before the pandemic at the multidisciplinary outpatient clinic. We  followed prospectively this cohort from beginning of April 2020 until the end of  April 2021. During 13 months of follow-up, of the 1047 (599 M/448 F) patients,  592 (56.5%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 PCR at least once and 215 (20.5%; 95% CI  0.18-0.23) were tested positive. We observed 2 peaks which took place in December  2020 and April 2021. Of the 215 PCR positive patients, complete information was  available in 214. Of these 214, 14 (6.5%) were asymptomatic for COVID-19. In the  remaining, the most common symptoms were anosmia, fatigue, fever, arthralgia, and  headache. A total of 40 (18.7%) had lung involvement, 25 (11.7%) were  hospitalized, 1 was admitted to the intensive care unit while none died.  Favipiravir was the most prescribed drug (74.3%), followed by colchicine (40.2%),  and hydroxychloroquine (20.1%) in the treatment of COVID-19. After COVID-19, 5  patients (2.3%) were given supplemental O(2) and 31 (14.5%) antiaggregant or  anticoagulants. During COVID-19, of the 214 PCR positive patients, 116 (54.2%)  decreased the dose of their immunosuppressives or stopped taking completely; 36  (16.8%) experienced a BS flare which was mostly oral ulcers (10.3%). None of the  patients reported a thrombotic event. A total of 93 (43.5%) patients reported BS  flares after a median 45 days of COVID-19 infection and this was found to be  significantly associated with immunosuppressive drug discontinuation. Multiple  regression analysis adjusted for age and gender indicated that smoking and using  interferon-alpha decreased the likelihood of getting COVID-19. The incidence and  severity of COVID-19 did not differ between those who were using colchicine or  not. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in this prospectively followed cohort  of BS patients was almost two folds of that estimated for the general population  living in Istanbul, Turkey, however, the clinical outcome of COVID-19 was not  severe and there was no mortality. The protective effect of smoking and  interferon deserves further investigation. On the other hand, colchicine did not  have any positive or negative effect against COVID-19. Significant number of  patients flared after COVID-19, however, this was significantly associated with  immunosuppressive discontinuation during the infection. Contrary to our previous  observations, COVID-19 did not seem to exacerbate thrombotic events during or  after the infection.

AB  - Routinely the influenza virus significantly contributes to the formation of the annual incidence of acute respiratory infections, with a peak in winter season.  The high level of mutagenic potential of influenza viruses is a standard factor  determining the complexity of the rational choice of pharmacotherapy. The  upcoming epidemiological season 20202021 brings additional challenges for health  care practitioners mediated by the widespread prevalence in the human population  of a new infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus affecting the respiratory  system among many organs and systems. An adequate choice of pharmacotherapy tools  should be based on high efficiency and safety of drugs, with a possible reduction  in such negative factors as polypharmacy. This review includes comparative  pharmacological characteristics of drugs with activity against RNA viruses, along  with parameters of their clinical efficacy.

AB  - Hemodialysis patients are vulnerable to severe and lethal COVID-19, and their protective immunity against COVID-19 is not yet fully understood. Therefore, we  report a case of COVID-19 reinfection in a hemodialysis patient 81 days after the  first episode and discuss the role of antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 infection. A  hemodialysis patient developed asymptomatic COVID-19 due to an outbreak in a  hospital on October 29th, 2020. As he was hospitalized and did not develop any  symptoms, he was discharged on November 9th. On January 18th, he presented with  symptomatic COVID-19 due to close household contact. Then, he developed  respiratory failure and was transferred to National Center for Global Health and  Medicine if he would need intensive care. He recovered with oxygen inhalation,  favipiravir, and steroid treatment, and was discharged on February 12th. To  evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during two hospital stays, we measured  immunoglobulin (Ig) G specific for S1 subunit of Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2  (IgG-S1) , IgG specific for the full-length S protein (anti-Spike IgG) and  neutralizing antibodies. No seroconversion occurred 5 days after initial  infection, the seroconversion of IgG-S1 was observed 10 days after the second  infection. Similar to IgG-S1 antibody titer results, anti-Spike IgG and  neutralizing antibodies increased from 12 days after the second infection. In  conclusion, we experienced a case of COVID-19 reinfection in a hemodialysis  patient 81 days after the first episode and showed the kinetics and role of  antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to understand  SARS-CoV-2 reinfection risk in hemodialysis patients and its clinical  significance.

AB  - Thyroid crisis is an emergency due to impaired thyroid function caused by various conditions, particularly infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that result in the dysfunction of various vital  organs. We report a case of a 31-year-old Indonesian female with a 2-year history  of hyperthyroidism with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor  antibodies. (TRAb) who developed thyroid crisis possibly in association with  SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).  Prior to admission, she was treated for her hyperthyroidism with propylthiouracil  and had been in stable remission for a year. She was admitted to the Emergency  Room with complaints of watery stools, icteric sclerae, jaundice, coughing, and  shortness of breath. The physical examination showed a World Health Organization  (WHO) performance score of 4, delirium, blood pressure within normal limits,  tachycardia, tachypnea, axillary temperature of 36.7°C, icteric sclerae,  jaundice, and exophthalmos. There was a 3 cm palpable nodule on the right side of  the neck. Auscultation of the lungs revealed bilateral pulmonary rales. Abdominal  examination noted a palpable liver and enlarged spleen. Laboratory tests showed  thrombocytopenia, electrolyte imbalance, hypoalbuminemia and elevated  transaminases. The thyroid function tests showed a suppressed TSH level with an  elevated free thyroxine (FT4) level. The SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) swab test was positive. Initial patient management was with supportive  therapy that included favipiravir and anti-hyperthyroidism medication; however,  despite these interventions, her condition continued to deteriorate and she died  after a few hours. This case demonstrates no difference in therapy between  patients with thyroid crises and COVID-19 or other infections. Proper and timely  treatment is important for reducing mortality rates.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has severely destructed human life worldwide, with no suitable treatment until now. SARS-CoV-2 virus is unprecedented, resistance  against number of therapeutics and spreading rapidly with high mortality, which  warrants the need to discover new effective drugs to combat this situation. This  current study is undertaken to explore the antiviral potential of marine algal  compounds to inhibit the viral entry and its multiplication using computational  analysis. Among the proven drug discovery targets of SARS-CoV-2, spike  glycoprotein and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease are responsible for the virus  attachment and viral genome replication in the host cell. In this study, the  above-mentioned drug targets were docked with marine algal compounds (sulfated  polysaccharides, polysaccharide derivatives and polyphenols) using molecular  docking tools (AutoDockTools). The obtained results indicate that κ-carrageenan,  laminarin, eckol, trifucol and β-D-galactose are the top-ranking compounds  showing better docking scores with SARS-CoV-2 targets, than the current  experimental COVID-19 antiviral drugs like dexamethasone, remdesivir, favipiravir  and MIV-150. Further, molecular dynamic simulation, ADMET and density functional  theory calculations were evaluated to substantiate the findings. To the best of  our knowledge, this is the first report on in silico analysis of aforesaid algal  metabolites against SARS-CoV-2 targets. This study concludes that these  metabolites can be curative for COVID-19 in the hour of need after further  validations in in vitro and in vivo testings.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the central macular thickness (CMT), retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), ganglion cell layer thickness (GCLT), and choroidal  thickness (ChT) measurements in patients with coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19). METHODS: The study was conducted cross-sectionally 4 weeks after the  completed treatment of COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the  polymerase chain reaction test and/or clinical and radiological findings. The  patients with treated COVID-19 were enrolled in the COVID-19 group; age- and  sex-matched healthy participants served as the control group. All patients in the  COVID-19 group were hospitalized and treated with favipiravir, moxifloxacin, and  heparin without the requirement for intubation. The measurements of CMT, RNFLT  (in four quadrants), GCLT (in six sectors of two different boundaries), and ChT  (in five locations) were performed by swept-source optical coherence tomography  (SS-OCT). RESULTS: Similar visual acuity (p = 0.582) and intraocular pressure  (p = 0.766) values were observed between the COVID-19 and control groups.  Regarding SS-OCT measurements, all mean CMT, RNFLT (in four quadrants), GCLT (in  six sectors of two different boundaries), and ChT (in five locations) values were  similar in the COVID-19 and control groups (p > 0.05 for all). In the COVID-19  group, a statistically significant negative correlation was noted between the  mean ferritin level and temporal RNFLT (r = - 0.378, p = 0.014) and a positive  correlation was observed between the mean ferritin level and nasal RNFLT  (r = + 0.371, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: SS-OCT measurements showed no retinal  neurodegenerative and choroidal thickness alterations in COVID-19 patients.  Nonsignificant results might be due to the examination of the patients in the  early period of the COVID-19 after the treatment. Therefore, late period OCT  measurements should be reviewed with new studies in the future.

AB  - The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had rapidly spread and became a worldwide pandemic since its detection in Wuhan, China. The disease has caused  significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among patients with  comorbidities. The current treatment involves supportive management alongside  antiviral therapy and immunosuppressant therapy in severely affected patients. We  describe a case of a patient with underlying lupus nephritis (LN) who presented  with severe COVID-19 infection and concomitant LN flare with acute kidney injury  (AKI). The patient was treated with antiviral therapy, Favipiravir, considering  his risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. As the patients would usually  have AKI alongside LN flare, we administered initial steroid therapy at a lower  dose (Methylprednisolone 50mg daily) and oral hydroxychloroquine despite the  initial concerns on immunosuppressant usage in COVID-19 infections. Although our  patient recovered relatively well from COVID- 19 infection, he continued to have  positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal  swab for COVID-19 up to 29 days of illness. His kidney function stabilised  despite having persistent nephrotic range proteinuria. Hence, the attending team  decided to pulse the patient with a high dose steroid (IV Methylprednisolone  250mg OD for three days) after two weeks of illness despite the persistent  positive swab. The patient's condition continued to improve, and this case  illustrates an approach in treating COVID-19 with concomitant active  immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. We find that it is safe to institute high  dose immunosuppressant in recovered COVID-19 patients two weeks after the  illness.

AB  - Antiviral drugs (AvDs) are the primary resource in the global battle against viruses, including the recent fight against corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  Most AvDs require multiple medications, and their use frequently leads to drug  resistance, since they have poor oral bioavailability and low efficacy due to  their low solubility/low permeability. Characterizing the in vivo metabolism and  pharmacokinetic characteristics of AvDs may help to solve the problems associated  with AvDs and enhance their efficacy. In this review of AvDs, we systematically  investigated their structure-based metabolic reactions and related enzymes, their  cellular pharmacology, and the effects of metabolism on AvD pharmacodynamics and  pharmacokinetics. We further assessed how delivery systems achieve better  metabolism and pharmacology of AvDs. This review suggests that suitable  nanosystems may help to achieve better pharmacological activity and  pharmacokinetic behavior of AvDs by altering drug metabolism through the  utilization of advanced nanotechnology and appropriate administration routes.  Notably, such AvDs as ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir, chloroquine, lopinavir  and ritonavir have been confirmed to bind to the severe acute respiratory  syndrome-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) receptor and thus may represent  anti-COVID-19 treatments. Elucidating the metabolic and pharmacokinetic  characteristics of AvDs may help pharmacologists to identify new formulations  with high bioavailability and efficacy and help physicians to better treat  virus-related diseases, including COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior to the availability of the current COVID-19 vaccine, the need to control the pandemic worldwide was focused on management of the disease using  previously approved antivirals, including Favipiravir which inhibits viral  replication through the RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme. Favipiravir's  efficacy against different viral infections has made it a potential treatment for  COVID-19. We are aiming in this study to assess the therapeutic efficacy and  safety of Favipiravir in treating critically ill patients admitted with COVID-19  to Intensive Care Units (ICUs). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study was  conducted in five tertiary hospitals in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).  The studied sample was randomized from a huge pool of data collected primarily  for critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to (ICUs) during the period between  April 2020 to March 2021. Two groups of patients matched 1: 1 for age and body  mass index (BMI) was enrolled in the study; one group received Favipiravir and  another comparison group received other antimicrobial medications, not including  Favipiravir. RESULTS: A total data of 538 COVID-19 patients were analyzed, 269  (50.%) received Favipiravir and 269 (50%) the control group received different  treatments. More than two-thirds 201 (74.7%) were Saudi citizens, the majority  177 (65.8%) were males and the mean age and (BMI) were; (57.23 ± 15.16) years and  (31.61 ± 7.33) kg/m2 respectively. The most frequent symptoms of presentation  were shortness of breath (SOB), fever, and cough, and the most frequent  comorbidity was diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease. In  the supplemental therapy, corticosteroid, tocilizumab and chloroquine were  statistically significant (P = 0.001) when combined in the FVP group more than in  the comparison group. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was more  frequent among Favipiravir group, while the overall mortality rate among the  Favipiravir group was not statistically significant (p-value 0.4). CONCLUSION:  According to the study's results revealing FVP is not superior to other  antivirals, patients who received Favipiravir presented with more severe  symptoms, more comorbidities, more complications, and is not effective in  controlling the cytokine storm which negatively impact the efficacy of  Favipiravir. FVP therapy had no influence on ICU and hospital length of stay in  comparison with the control group as well as in the overall mortality rate among  the FVP group was not statistically significant. further research is needed to  understand how FVP along with other treatments can improve the length of stay  among COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has wreaked havoc across the globe for the last two years. More than 300 million cases and over 5  million deaths later, we continue battling the first real pandemic of the 21st  century. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly, reaching most countries within the first half  of 2020, and New Zealand was not an exception. Here, we describe the first  isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants during the initial virus  outbreak in New Zealand. Patient-derived nasopharyngeal samples were used to  inoculate Vero cells and, three to four days later, a cytopathic effect was  observed in seven viral cultures. Viral growth kinetics was characterized using  Vero and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. The identity of the viruses was verified by  RT-qPCR, Western blot, indirect immunofluorescence assays, and electron  microscopy. Whole-genome sequences were analyzed using two different yet  complementary deep sequencing platforms (MiSeq/Illumina and Ion PGM™/Ion  Torrent™), classifying the viruses as SARS-CoV-2 B.55, B.31, B.1, or B.1.369  based on the Pango Lineage nomenclature. All seven SARS-CoV-2 isolates were  susceptible to remdesivir (EC(50) values from 0.83 to 2.42 µM) and  β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (molnupiravir, EC(50) values from 0.96 to 1.15 µM) but  not to favipiravir (>10 µM). Interestingly, four SARS-CoV-2 isolates, carrying  the D614G substitution originally associated with increased transmissibility,  were more susceptible (2.4-fold) to a commercial monoclonal antibody targeting  the spike glycoprotein than the wild-type viruses. Altogether, this seminal work  allowed for early access to SARS-CoV-2 isolates in New Zealand, paving the way  for numerous clinical and scientific research projects in the country, including  the development and validation of diagnostic assays, antiviral strategies, and a  national COVID-19 vaccine development program.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although more than a year past since COVID-19 was defined, there is no specific treatment yet. Since COVID-19 management differs over time, it is  hard to determine which therapy is more efficacious. In this study, we aimed to  evaluate the efficacy of the regimen with Favipiravir (FPV) and determine if the  timing of FPV addition offers any improvement. METHODS: A retrospective  observational case-controlled cohort study was performed between March and  September 2020, including adults with COVID-19 in a single-center in Turkey. We  categorized patients into age-sex matched three groups, group 1 (n = 48) and  group 2 (n = 48) included patients treated with the combination of FPV plus  Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) early and late, respectively. Group 3 (n = 48) consisted  of patients on HQ monotherapy. In Group 2, if the respiratory or clinic condition  had not improved sufficiently, FPV was added on or after day 3. RESULTS: We found  that starting FPV early had an impact on PCR negativity and the progression of  the disease. 'No progression' was defined as the absence of a new finding in the  control radiological examination and the absence of accompanying clinical  deterioration. Also, the decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) was greater in  Group 1 than Group 3 (p < 0.001). However, we found that early initiation of FPV  treatment did not have a positive effect on the estimated survival time.  CONCLUSIONS: According to this retrospective study results, we believe that for  better clinical outcomes, FPV treatment should be started promptly to enhance  antiviral effects and improve clinical outcomes.

T2  - Journal of medical Internet research
AB  - BACKGROUND: Driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the dire need to discover an antiviral drug, we explored the landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 biomedical  publications to identify potential treatments. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study  are to identify off-label drugs that may have benefits for the coronavirus  disease pandemic, present a novel ranking algorithm called CovidX to recommend  existing drugs for potential repurposing, and validate the literature-based  outcome with drug knowledge available in clinical trials. METHODS: To achieve  such objectives, we applied natural language processing techniques to identify  drugs and linked entities (eg, disease, gene, protein, chemical compounds). When  such entities are linked, they form a map that can be further explored using  network science tools. The CovidX algorithm was based upon a notion that we  called "diversity." A diversity score for a given drug was calculated by  measuring how "diverse" a drug is calculated using various biological entities  (regardless of the cardinality of actual instances in each category). The  algorithm validates the ranking and awards those drugs that are currently being  investigated in open clinical trials. The rationale behind the open clinical  trial is to provide a validating mechanism of the PubMed results. This ensures  providing up to date evidence of the fast development of this disease. RESULTS:  From the analyzed biomedical literature, the algorithm identified 30 possible  drug candidates for repurposing, ranked them accordingly, and validated the  ranking outcomes against evidence from clinical trials. The top 10 candidates  according to our algorithm are hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, chloroquine,  ritonavir, losartan, remdesivir, favipiravir, methylprednisolone, rapamycin, and  tilorone dihydrochloride. CONCLUSIONS: The ranking shows both consistency and  promise in identifying drugs that can be repurposed. We believe, however, the  full treatment to be a multifaceted, adjuvant approach where multiple drugs may  need to be taken at the same time.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic is severely threatening public healthcare systems around the globe. Some supporting therapies such as remdesivir, favipiravir, and  ivermectin are still under the process of a clinical trial, it is thus urgent to  find alternative treatment and prevention options for SARS-CoV-2. In this regard,  although many natural products have been tested and/or suggested for the  treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19, carotenoids as an important class of  natural products were underexplored. The dietary supplementation of some  carotenoids was already suggested to be potentially effective in the treatment of  COVID-19 due to their strong antioxidant properties. In this study, we performed  an in silico screening of common food-derived carotenoids against druggable  target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 including main protease, helicase, replication  complex, spike protein and its mutants for the recent variants of concern, and  ADP-ribose phosphatase. Molecular docking results revealed that some of the  carotenoids had low binding energies toward multiple receptors. Particularly,  crocin had the strongest binding affinity (-10.5 kcal/mol) toward the replication  complex of SARS-CoV-2 and indeed possessed quite low binding energy scores for  other targets as well. The stability of crocin in the corresponding receptors was  confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. Our study, therefore, suggests that  carotenoids, especially crocin, can be considered an effective alternative  therapeutics and a dietary supplement candidate for the prophylaxis and treatment  of SARS-CoV-2. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In this study, food-derived carotenoids as  dietary supplements have the potential to be used for the prophylaxis and/or  treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico techniques, we aimed at discovering  food-derived carotenoids with inhibitory effects against multiple druggable sites  of SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking experiments against main protease, helicase,  replication complex, spike protein and its mutants for the recent variants of  concern, and ADP-ribose phosphatase resulted in a few carotenoids with  multitarget inhibitory effects. Particularly, crocin as one of the main  components of saffron exhibited strong binding affinities to the multiple drug  targets including main protease, helicase, replication complex, mutant spike  protein of lineage B.1.351, and ADP-ribose phosphatase. The stability of the  crocin complexed with these drug targets was further confirmed through molecular  dynamics simulations. Overall, our study provides the preliminary data for the  potential use of food-derived carotenoids, particularly crocin, as dietary  supplements in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of factors such as age, gender, comorbid diseases and treatments applied on the positive duration  of the PCR test in COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: The duration of PCR positivity  in COVID-19 patients varies. Studies in the literature investigating factors that  may affect this duration are limited. METHODS: Between March and September 2020,  individuals with two or more positive PCR results with a 14-day interval were  included in the case group, and those whose PCR results turned negative within 14  days were included in the control group. The relationship between age, gender,  contact environment, presence of additional disease, drugs used, smoking and  alcohol consumption; type, duration and severity of COVID-19 symptoms, treatment  applied for COVID-19 and duration of PCR positivity were examined. RESULTS: Among  126 participants the mean duration of PCR positivity was 23.38 days (min 6, max  52). Symptoms lasted 15-30 days in 41 patients (32.5 %) and 5-10 days in 30  patients (23.8 %). The positivity duration varied according to age, smoking and  alcohol consumption status, and body mass index. Patients with chronic disease,  and who had loss of taste and smell during the disease had a longer positive  stay. This period was shorter in favipiravir users. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19  infection, there are several factors that affect the PCR test to remain positive.  Early-term favipiravir use may shorten this period as a modifiable factor (Tab.  3, Ref. 14).

AB  - The management of COVID-19 in Rwanda has been dynamic, and the use of COVID-19 therapeutics has gradually been updated based on scientific discoveries. The  treatment for COVID-19 remained patient-centered and entirely state-sponsored  during the first and second waves. From the time of identification of the index  case in March 2020 up to August 2021, three versions of the clinical management  guidelines were developed, with the aim of ensuring that the COVID-19 patients  treated in Rwanda were receiving care based on the most recent therapeutic  discoveries. As the case load increased and imposed imminent heavy burdens on the  healthcare system, a smooth transition was made to enable that the asymptomatic  and mild COVID-19 cases could continue to be closely observed and managed while  they remained in their homes. The care provided to patients requiring  facility-based interventions mainly focused on the provision of anti-inflammatory  drugs, anticoagulation, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, management of  hyperglycemia and the provision of therapeutics with a direct antiviral effect  such as favipiravir and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The time to viral  clearance was observed to be shortest among eligible patients treated with  neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bamlanivimab). Moving forward, as we strive  to continue detecting COVID-19 cases as early as possible, and promptly initiate  supportive interventions, the use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies  constitutes an attractive and cost-effective therapeutic approach. If this  approach is used strategically along with other measures in place (i.e., COVID-19  vaccine roll out, etc.), it will enable us to bring this global battle against  the COVID-19 pandemic under full control and with a low case fatality rate.

AB  - Objective Among treatment options for coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), well-studied oral medications are limited. We conducted a multicenter  non-randomized, uncontrolled single-arm prospective study to assess the efficacy  and safety of favipiravir for patients with COVID-19. Methods One hundred  participants were sequentially recruited to 2 cohorts: cohort 1 (Day 1: 1,600  mg/day, Day 2 to 14: 600 mg/day, n=50) and cohort 2 (Day 1: 1,800 mg/day, Day 2  to 14: 800 mg/day, n=50). The efficacy endpoint was the negative conversion rate  of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the odds  ratio (OR) of cohort 2 to cohort 1 for negative conversion on Day 10 was  calculated. Characteristics of all participants and profiles of adverse events  (AEs) were collected and analyzed. Results The mean age of participants was  62.8±17.6 years old. Thirty-four patients (34.0%) experienced worsening  pneumonia, 7 (7.0%) were intubated, and 4 (4.0%) died during the observation  period. Cohort 2 showed a higher negative conversion rate than cohort 1 [adjusted  OR 3.32 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17 to 9.38), p=0.024], and this  association was maintained after adjusting for the age, sex, body mass index, and  baseline C-reactive protein level. Regarding adverse events, hyperuricemia was  most frequently observed followed by an elevation of the liver enzyme levels  (all-grade: 49.0%, Grade ≥3: 12.0%), and cohort 2 tended to have a higher  incidence than cohort 1. However, no remarkable association of adverse events was  observed between patients <65 and ≥65 years old. Conclusion The antiviral  efficacy of favipiravir was difficult to interpret due to the limitation of the  study design. However, no remarkable issues with safety or tolerability  associated with favipiravir were observed, even in elderly patients with  COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this international multicentre study was to review potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) for real-life coadministration of  combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19)-specific medications. METHODS: The Euroguidelines in Central and  Eastern Europe Network Group initiated a retrospective, observational cohort  study of HIV-positive patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected through a  standardized questionnaire and DDIs were identified using the University of  Liverpool's interaction checker. RESULTS: In total, 524 (94.1% of 557) patients  received cART at COVID-19 onset: 117 (22.3%) were female, and the median age was  42 (interquartile range 36-50) years. Only 115 (21.9%) patients were  hospitalized, of whom 34 required oxygen therapy. The most frequent nucleoside  reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone was tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  (TDF)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) with lamivudine or emtricitabine (XTC) (79.3%)  along with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) (68.5%), nonnucleoside  reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (17.7%), protease inhibitor (PI) (13.7%)  or other (2.5%). In total, 148 (28.2%) patients received COVID-19-specific  treatments: corticosteroids (15.7%), favipiravir (7.1%), remdesivir (3.1%),  hydroxychloroquine (2.7%), tocilizumab (0.6%) and anakinra (0.2%). In total, 62  DDI episodes were identified in 58 patients (11.8% of the total cohort and 41.9%  of the COVID-19-specific treatment group). The use of boosted PIs and  elvitegravir accounted for 43 DDIs (29%), whereas NNRTIs were responsible for 14  DDIs (9.5%). CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis from the Central and Eastern European  region on HIV-positive persons receiving COVID-19-specific treatment, it was  found that potential DDIs were common. Although low-dose steroids are mainly used  for COVID-19 treatment, comedication with boosted antiretrovirals seems to have  the most frequent potential for DDIs. In addition, attention should be paid to  NNRTI coadministration.

AB  - PURPOSE: In the wake of SARS-CoV-2's global spread, human activities from health to social life to education have been affected. Favipiravir and  Molnupiravir exhibited novel hexokinase inhibition and we discuss advantages of  this property in their COVID-19 inhibition potential. METHODS: This paper  describes molecular docking data of human hexokinase II with Favipiravir, Cyan  20, Remdesivir, 2DG, and Molnupiravir along with hexokinase inhibition assays.  RESULTS: Favipiravir, an antiviral drug previously cleared for treating the flu  and ebola, has shown some promise in early trials to treat COVID-19. We observed  potent human hexokinase inhibiting potential of Favipiravir (50%) as against 4%  and merely 0.3% hexokinase inhibition with Molnupiravir and 2 Deoxy D glucose at  0.1 mM concentration supported by molecular docking studies. CONCLUSION:  Favipiravir could continue to be part of the COVID-19 treatment regimen due to  its resistance to host esterases, hexokinase inhibition potential and proven  safety through human trials.

AB  - Treatment with tocilizumab (TCZ) to block interleukin-6 (IL-6) signalling is predicted to mitigate cytokine release syndrome (CRS) caused by coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the adverse effects of TCZ on patients with  COVID-19 remain unclear. We herein report a patient with COVID-19 treated with  TCZ who developed acute hypertriglyceridaemia. Despite favipiravir treatment,  acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in a 45-year-old patient with  COVID-19; thus, TCZ was initiated. The triglyceride levels greatly increased  after TCZ administration. Physicians should consider the negative impact of TCZ  on the lipid profile in patients with COVID-19, although COVID-19-induced CRS  itself may be an aggravating factor.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic and is a threat to global health. Patients who experienced cytokine  storms tend to have a high mortality rate. However, to date, no study has  investigated the impact of cytokine storms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This  retrospective cohort study included only COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized  in a Private Hospital in West Jakarta between March and September 2020. All  patients were not vaccinated during this period and treatment was based on the  guidelines by the Ministry of Health Indonesia. A convenience sampling method was  used and all patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. RESULTS: The  clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients following medical therapy was either cured  (85.7%) or died (14.3%), with 14.3% patients reported to have cytokine storm,  from which 23.1% led to fatalities. A plasma immunoglobulin (Gammaraas®) and/or  tocilizumab (interleukin-6 receptor antagonist; Actemra®) injection was utilised  to treat the cytokine storm while remdesivir and oseltamivir were administered to  ameliorate COVID-19. Most (61.5%) patients who experienced the cytokine storm  were male; mean age 60 years. Interestingly, all patients who experienced the  cytokine storm had hypertension or/ and diabetes complication (100%). Fever,  cough and shortness of breath were also the common symptoms (100.0%). Almost all  (92.3%) patients with cytokine storm had to be treated in the intensive care unit  (ICU). Most (76.9%) patients who had cytokine storm received hydroxychloroquine  and all had antibiotics [1) azithromycin + levofloxacin or 2) meropenam for  critically ill patients] and vitamins such as vitamins C and B-complex as well as  mineral. Unfortunately, from this group, 23.1% patients died while the remaining  70% of patients recovered. A significant (p<0.05) correlation was established  between cytokine storms and age, the presence of comorbidity, diabetes,  hypertension, fever, shortness of breath, having oxygen saturation (SPO2) less  than 93%, cold, fatigue, ward of admission, the severity of COVID-19 disease,  duration of treatment as well as the use of remdesivir, Actemra® and Gammaraas®.  Most patients recovered after receiving a combination treatment (oseltamivir +  remdesivir + Antibiotics + Vitamin/Mineral) for approximately 11 days with a 90%  survival rate. On the contrary, patients who received oseltamivir +  hydroxychloroquine + Gammaraas® + antibiotics +Vitamin/Mineral, had a 83%  survival rate after being admitted to the hospital for about ten days.  CONCLUSION: Factors influencing the development of a cytokine storm include age,  duration of treatment, comorbidity, symptoms, type of admission ward and severity  of infection. Most patients (76.92%) with cytokine storm who received  Gammaraas®/Actemra®, survived although they were in the severe and critical  levels (87.17%). Overall, based on the treatment duration and survival rate, the  most effective therapy was a combination of oseltamivir + favipiravir +  hydroxychloroquine + antibiotics + vitamins/minerals.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Measurement of blood Favipiravir (FPV) levels and accumulation of data in COVID-19 patients are critical for assessing FPV efficacy and safety. We  performed a retrospective study based on measurements of blood levels of FPV and  related factors in COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital. Furthermore, we  also investigated the association between blood FPV levels and uric acid level  alterations before and after FPV administration. METHODS: We enrolled 27 COVID-19  patients who had received FPV treatment at Hokushin General Hospital from April 1  to December 31, 2020. Age, gender, COVID-19 severity, presence of comorbidities,  and laboratory data for each subject were investigated to identify factors that  correlate with blood FPV levels. Uric acid levels were measured before and after  FPV administration and a difference between the levels (i.e., a change of uric  acid level) was evaluated. RESULTS: When a significant univariate variable was  input by the stepwise method and a combination of variables that maintained  statistical superiority was searched, serum ferritin was the only factor that  independently affected blood FPV level. Furthermore, in the high-FPV group  (20 μg/mL or more), a significant increase in uric acid levels was observed after  FPV administration. The increment value was significantly larger than that in the  low-FPV group (less than 20 μg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Ferritin level was an important  independent factor inversely affecting blood FPV level. Furthermore, a high blood  FPV level induced the elevation of uric acid levels in COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious viral infection caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. It has  ravaged several countries and burdened many healthcare systems. As the process of  authorizing a novel treatment for human use is extensive and involves multiple  phases to obtain safety information and identify potential concerns. Therefore,  the fastest and easiest choice was to use United States Food and Drug  Administration (US FDA)-approved drugs such as favipiravir and  hydroxychloroquine. For the simultaneous estimation of both medications, a simple  synchronous spectrofluorimetric approach was established in which both drugs were  measured at 372 and 323 nm, respectively in the presence of each other without  interference at Δλ 60 nm. The effect of various experimental conditions on  synchronous fluorescence intensities were thoroughly investigated and optimized.  The maximum synchronous fluorescence intensities were obtained at pH 5.4 using  acetate buffer (0.2 M, 0.5 ml) and ethanol as a diluent. Excellent linearity  ranges were obtained using 1.0-18.0 ng/ml and 10.0-120.0 ng/ml for favipiravir  and hydroxychloroquine, respectively. The approach exhibited high sensitivity  with detection limits down to 0.25 ng/ml and 1.52 ng/ml and quantitation limits  down to 0.77 ng/ml and 4.62 ng/ml, respectively. Spiking human plasma samples  with the studied drugs yielded high % recoveries, allowing a significant  bioanalytical application. Moreover, the method was validated according to  International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and further applied to  commercial pharmaceutical preparations with good results.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Its main protease, 3C-like protease (3CLpro),  is an attractive target for drug design, due to its importance in virus  replication. The analysis of the radial distribution function of 159 3CLpro  structures reveals a high similarity index. A study of the catalytic pocket of  3CLpro with bound inhibitors reveals that the influence of the inhibitors is  local, perturbing dominantly only residues in the active pocket. A machine  learning based model with high predictive ability against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is  designed and validated. The model is used to perform a drug-repurposing study,  with the main aim to identify existing drugs with the highest 3CLpro inhibition  power. Among antiviral agents, lopinavir, idoxuridine, paritaprevir, and  favipiravir showed the highest inhibition potential. Enzyme - ligand interactions  as a key ingredient for successful drug design.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidemiology and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Thailand are scarce. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult hospitalized  patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Siriraj Hospital during February  2020 to April 2020. RESULTS: The prevalence of COVID-19 was 7.5% (107 COVID-19  patients) among 1409 patients who underwent RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection at  our hospital during the outbreak period. Patients with COVID-19 presented with  symptoms in 94.4%. Among the 104 patients who were treated with antiviral  medications, 78 (75%) received 2-drug regimen (lopinavir/ritonavir or  darunavir/ritonavir plus chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine), and 26 (25%)  received a 3-drug regimen with favipiravir added to the 2-drug regimen. Disease  progression was observed in 18 patients (16.8%). All patients with COVID-19 were  discharged alive. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COVID-19 was 7.5% among patients  who underwent RT-PCR testing, and 10% among those having risk factors for  COVID-19 acquisition. Combination antiviral therapies for COVID-19 patients were  well-tolerated and produced a favorable outcome.

AB  - Since the outbreak emerged in November 2019, no effective drug has yet been found against SARS-CoV-2. Repositioning studies of existing drug molecules or  candidates are gaining in overcoming COVID-19. Antiviral drugs such as  remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, and galidesivir act by inhibiting the vital  RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. The importance of in silico studies in repurposing  drug research is gradually increasing during the COVID-19 process. The present  study found that especially ribavirin triphosphate and galidesivir triphosphate  active metabolites had a higher affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase than ATP  by molecular docking. With the Molecular Dynamics simulation, we have observed  that these compounds increase the complex's stability and validate the molecular  docking results. We also explained that the interaction of RNA polymerase  inhibitors with Mg(++), which is in the structure of NSP12, is essential and  necessary to interact with the RNA strand. In vitro and clinical studies on these  two molecules need to be increased.

TI  - Virtual Screening and Quantum Chemistry Analysis for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Using the ChEMBL Database: Reproduction of the Remdesivir-RTP and  Favipiravir-RTP Binding Modes Obtained from Cryo-EM Experiments with High Binding  Affinity.
AU  - Tsuji, Motonori
T2  - International journal of molecular sciences
AB  - The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the pathogenic cause of coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19). The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is a potential  target for the treatment of COVID-19. An RdRp complex:dsRNA structure suitable  for docking simulations was prepared using a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)  structure (PDB ID: 7AAP; resolution, 2.60 Å) that was reported recently.  Structural refinement was performed using energy calculations. Structure-based  virtual screening was performed using the ChEMBL database. Through 1,838,257  screenings, 249 drugs (37 approved, 93 clinical, and 119 preclinical drugs) were  predicted to exhibit a high binding affinity for the RdRp complex:dsRNA. Nine  nucleoside triphosphate analogs with anti-viral activity were included among  these hit drugs, and among them, remdesivir-ribonucleoside triphosphate and  favipiravir-ribonucleoside triphosphate adopted a similar docking mode as that  observed in the cryo-EM structure. Additional docking simulations for the  predicted compounds with high binding affinity for the RdRp complex:dsRNA  suggested that 184 bioactive compounds could be anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates.  The hit bioactive compounds mainly consisted of a typical noncovalent major  groove binder for dsRNA. Three-layer ONIOM (MP2/6-31G:AM1:AMBER) geometry  optimization calculations and frequency analyses (MP2/6-31G:AMBER) were performed  to estimate the binding free energy of a representative bioactive compound  obtained from the docking simulation, and the fragment molecular orbital  calculation at the MP2/6-31G level of theory was subsequently performed for  analyzing the detailed interactions. The procedure used in this study represents  a possible strategy for discovering anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs from drug libraries  that could significantly shorten the clinical development period for drug  repositioning.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has occasioned worldwide alarm.  Globally, the number of reported confirmed cases has exceeded 84.3 million as of  this writing (January 2, 2021). Since there are no targeted therapies for  COVID-19, the current focus is the repurposing of drugs approved for other uses.  In some clinical trials, antiviral drugs such as remdesivir (Grein et al., 2020),  lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (Cao et al., 2020), chloroquine (Gao et al., 2020),  hydroxychloroquine (Gautret et al., 2020), arbidol (Wang et al., 2020), and  favipiravir (Cai et al., 2020b) have shown efficacy in COVID-19 patients. LPV/r  combined with arbidol, which is the basic regimen in some regional hospitals in  China including Zhejiiang Province, has shown antiviral effects in COVID-19  patients (Guo et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). A retrospective cohort study also  reported that this combination therapy showed better efficacy than LPV/r alone  for the treatment of COVID-19 patients (Deng et al., 2020).

AB  - Favipiravir (FVP), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV), and interferon-beta (INF-beta) are considered as potential treatments for COVID-19. We examined the efficacy and  safety of FVP and INF-beta compared to LPV/RTV and INF-beta combinations for the  treatment of SARS-CoV-2. It was a single-center randomized clinical trial.  Eligible patients were randomized to receive FVP plus INF-beta versus LPV/RTV  plus INF-beta. The primary endpoint was the viral clearance after seven days of  randomization. ICU admission, length of stay (LOS) in hospital, in-hospital  mortality, and the incidence of adverse events were also measured. This trial was  registered on the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20200506047323N3).  Patients were randomly allocated to the FVP (n = 33) and LPV/RTV (n = 33) groups.  The viral clearance on Day seven was not significantly different between the FVP  (31.1%) and the LPV/RTV groups (16.1%). The rate of ICU admission and likewise  the in-hospital mortality in the FVP group (12.5% and 6.3%, respectively) were  similar to the LPV/RTV groups (19.4% and 19.4%, respectively). The median LOS in  the hospital was also not different (6.8 days [interquartile range;  IQR = 5.0-11.0] in the FVP and (8.0 days [IQR = 5.5-12.5]) in LPV/RTV groups  (p = 0.140). Adverse events were observed in 25.0% of FVP and 32.3% of LPV/RTV  groups. The combination therapy with FVP did not exert a higher efficacy compared  to the combination regimen of LPV/RTV. However, both treatment regimens  demonstrated a mild profile of adverse events.

AB  - There is no consensus on the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and modification of immunosuppressive therapy in kidney transplant recipients  (KTRs). In this study, we examined the clinical outcome of our KTRs with COVID-19  disease, who were treated with a broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory protocol. This  protocol is essentially composed of intravenous immunoglobulin +/- tocilizumab in  KTRs with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Among 809 KTRs, 64 patients diagnosed with  COVID-19 disease between April 2020 and February 2021, were evaluated.  Twenty-nine patients with pneumonia confirmed by chest computed tomography  (CCT) were hospitalized. The treatment protocol included high-dose intravenous  methylprednisolone, favipiravir, enoxaparin, and empirical antibiotics. Patients  with pneumonic involvement of more than 25% on CCT with or without respiratory  failure were given a total of 2 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy.  Nonresponders received tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antibody. Of the 29  patients with pneumonia, 6 were treated in other hospitals. These six patients  did not receive IVIg and 5 of them deceased. In our center, IVIg treatment was  applied to 15 of 23 patients. Seven of them required tocilizumab. Respiratory  parameters improved significantly in all but one patient after IVIg ± tocilizumab  treatment. The mortality rate was 6.6% in patients who received IVIg therapy and  35.7% in those who did not (p = 0.08). The mortality rate was higher in patients  who received treatment in external centers (2.2% vs. 26.3%; p = 0.0073). The  treatment of KTRs with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in organ transplant centers with  significant experience yields better results. The administration of  broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory treatment in this patient group was safe and  provided excellent outcomes.

T2  - Computers in biology and medicine
AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there are no particular antivirals  available to battle with COVID-19. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has  emerged as a novel drug target due to its essential role in virus replication. In  this study, turmeric-derived compounds were chosen and subjected to in-silico  analysis to evaluate their binding affinity against the RdRp-RNA complex of  SARS-CoV-2. Our in-silico approach included the analysis of protein-ligand  interactions by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, followed by  free energy calculations by molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area  analysis. Curcumin and diacetylcurcumin showed stability and good binding  affinity at the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-RNA complex. Furthermore, to  validate the potency of selected compounds, we compared them with Favipiravir and  Remdesivir antiviral drugs from our previous analysis on targeting tea bioactive  molecules to inhibit RdRp-RNA complex. The comparative analysis revealed that the  selected compounds showed higher potential to be developed as RdRp-RNA inhibitors  than antiviral medicines Remdesivir and Favipiravir. However, these compounds  need to be further validated by in-vitro and in-vivo investigations.

AB  - Pandemic COVID-19 infections have spread throughout the world. There is no effective treatment against this disease. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  (RdRp) catalyzes the replication of RNA from RNA and the main protease (M(pro))  has a role in the processing of polyproteins that are translated from the RNA of  SARS-CoV-2, and thus these two enzymes are strong candidates for targeting by  anti-viral drugs. Small molecules such as lopinavir and favipiravir significantly  inhibit the activity of M(pro) and RdRp in vitro. Studies have shown that  structurally modified lopinavir, favipiravir, and other similar compounds can  inhibit COVID-19 main protease (M(pro)) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).  In this study, lopinavir and its structurally similar compounds were chosen to  bind the main protease, and favipiravir was chosen to target RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase. Molecular docking and the quantitative structure-activity  relationships (QSAR) study revealed that the selected candidates have favorable  binding affinity but less druggable properties. To improve the druggability, four  structural analogues of lopinavir and one structural analogue of favipiravir was  designed by structural modification. Molecular interaction analyses have  displayed that lopinavir and favipiravir analogues interact with the active site  residues of M(pro) and RdRp, respectively. Absorption, distribution, metabolism,  excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties, medicinal chemistry profile, and  physicochemical features were shown that all structurally modified analogues are  less toxic and contain high druggable properties than the selected candidates.  Subsequently, 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the top four docked  complexes demonstrated that CID44271905, a lopinavir analogue, forms the most  stable complex with the M(pro). Further MMPBSA analyses using the MD trajectories  also confirmed the higher binding affinity of CID44271905 towards M(pro). In  summary, this study demonstrates a new way to identify leads for novel anti-viral  drugs against COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - The first aim of the study was to analyze the change in antibody titer at 15-day intervals until 60 days postsymptom onset (PSO). The second aim was to analyze  the relationship between antibody titer and symptom grade, gender, age, body mass  index (BMI), medications, vitamin supplements, and herbal therapies. Blood  samples were collected from 43 patients (5 mild, 21 moderate, 17 severe  diseases), 18 women (41.9%), and 25 men (58.1%), on 15, 30, 45, and 60 days PSO  after COVID-19 infection. The serum antibody titers were determined by measuring  the COVID-19 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunoassay  (ELISA). Associations between the duration of symptoms, demographic and clinical  parameters, medications and vitamins used, and herbal therapies were evaluated by  interviewing the participants. Within the first 15 days of illness, 81.4% of the  patients were positive. From Day 45 PSO, seropositivity was 89.5%. The  anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were statistically higher in men than women at  all times (p < 0.01). Antibody titer was higher in older participants compared to  younger participants (p < 0.02). Plaquenil or favipiravir use did not affect  antibody response (p > 0.05). Men had a higher fever (p = 0.006), shortness of  breath (p = 0.004), and chest pain (p = 0.03) than women. We found powerful  antibody response by 60 days PSO, as well as higher antibody response and  severity of symptoms in the men gender. Data also showed that SARS-CoV-2  antibodies are higher in individuals with older age, whereas BMI, concomitant  chronic disease, and medications had no effect on antibody titers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2020 pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is an unprecedented global emergency. COVID-19 appears to be a disease with an early  phase where the virus replicates, coinciding with the first presentation of  symptoms, followed by a later 'inflammatory' phase which results in severe  disease in some individuals. It is known from other rapidly progressive  infections such as sepsis and influenza that early treatment with antimicrobials  is associated with a better outcome. The hypothesis is that this holds for  COVID-19 and that early antiviral treatment may prevent progression to the later  phase of the disease. METHODS: Trial design: Phase IIA randomised, double-blind,  2 × 2 design, placebo-controlled, interventional trial. RANDOMISATION:  Participants will be randomised 1:1 by stratification, with the following  factors: gender, obesity, symptomatic or asymptomatic, current smoking status  presence or absence of comorbidity, and if the participant has or has not been  vaccinated. BLINDING: Participants and investigators will both be blinded to  treatment allocation (double-blind). DISCUSSION: We propose to conduct a  proof-of-principle placebo-controlled clinical trial of favipiravir plus or minus  nitazoxanide in health workers, their household members and patients treated at  the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) facilities. Participants with or  without symptomatic COVID-19 or who tested positive will be assigned to receive  favipiravir plus nitazoxanide or favipiravir plus nitazoxanide placebo. The  primary outcome will be the difference in the amount of virus ('viral load') in  the upper respiratory tract after 5 days of therapy. Secondary outcomes will  include hospitalization, major morbidity and mortality, pharmacokinetics, and  impact of antiviral therapy on viral genetic mutation rate. If favipiravir with  nitazoxanide demonstrates important antiviral effects without significant  toxicity, there will be a strong case for a larger trial in people at high risk  of hospitalization or intensive care admission, for example older patients and/or  those with comorbidities and with early disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).  Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) inhibitors may increase the  expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is the receptor for  SARSCoV-2 Spike protein. The consequences of using angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the COVID-19  pandemic are unknown. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study aiming to identify  the odds of severe disease (defined as either hospitalization of ≥14 days,  admission to the intensive care unit, or death) associated with exposure to ACEi  or ARB was conducted. Adult patients (age ≥18 years) with COVID-19 admitted to  the İstanbul Faculty of Medicine Corona Center between March 9 and May 11, 2020,  were included. Chronic users of ACEi, ARB, or other antihypertensive drugs were  matched according to age, sex, sick days before hospitalization, comorbidities,  smoking, number of antihypertensive regimens, doxazosin use, furosemide use, and  serum creatinine level. Odds ratios (OR) of having severe disease were  calculated. RESULTS: In total, 611 patients were admitted with COVID-19,  confirmed by either reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or computed  tomography (CT). There were 363 males, and the age ranged from 18 to 98 years,  with an average age of 57±15 years. Of these, 165 participants had severe disease  (53 deaths, case fatality rate: 8.7%). Among those with hypertension (n=249), ARB  exposure was compatible with decreased odds (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.27-1.36, p=0.31)  of severe disease though not statistically significant, while ACEi exposure  significantly reduced the risk of severe disease (OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.15-0.87,  p=0.03). ACEi exposure was associated with milder infiltrations seen on baseline  CT, lower C-reactive protein and ferritin, higher monocytes, shorter  hospitalization, and less requirement for specific empirical treatments  (favipiravir and meropenem). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that exposure to ACEi  drugs may have favorable effects in the context of COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This exploratory study investigated four repurposed anti-infective drug regimens in outpatients with COVID-19. METHODS: This phase 2, single centre,  randomised, open-label, clinical trial was conducted in South Africa between 3rd  September 2020 and 23rd August 2021. Symptomatic outpatients aged 18-65 years,  with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were computer randomised (1:1:1:1:1)  to standard-of-care (SOC) with paracetamol, or SOC plus artesunate-amodiaquine  (ASAQ), pyronaridine-artesunate (PA), favipiravir plus nitazoxanide (FPV + NTZ),  or sofosbuvir-daclatasvir (SOF-DCV). The primary endpoint was the incidence of  viral clearance, i.e., the proportion of patients with a negative SARS-CoV-2  RT-PCR on day 7, compared to SOC using a log-binomial model in the modified  intention-to-treat (mITT) population. FINDINGS: The mITT population included 186  patients: mean age (SD) 34.9 (10.3) years, body weight 78.2 (17.1) kg. Day 7  SARS-CoV-2 clearance rates (n/N; risk ratio [95% CI]) were: SOC 34.2% (13/38),  ASAQ 38.5% (15/39; 0.80 [0.44, 1.47]), PA 30.3% (10/33; 0.69 [0.37, 1.29]),  FPV + NTZ 27.0% (10/37; 0.60 [0.31, 1.18]) and SOF-DCV 23.5% (8/34; 0.47 [0.22,  1.00]). Three lower respiratory tract infections occurred (PA 6.1% [2/33];  SOF-DCV 2.9% [1/34]); two required hospitalisation (PA, SOF-DCV). There were no  deaths. Adverse events occurred in 55.3% (105/190) of patients, including one  serious adverse event (pancytopenia; FPV + NTZ). INTERPRETATION: There was no  statistical difference in viral clearance for any regimen compared to SOC. All  treatments were well tolerated.

AB  - This study compared the pharmacokinetics and safety of favipiravir oral solution with those of tablet formulations, which were agents repurposed to treat  nonsevere coronavirus disease 2019 in Thailand. In an open-label, single-dose,  randomized, crossover study, 24 healthy subjects under fasting conditions were  randomly assigned to a single dose of 200 mg of favipiravir, either as an oral  solution of 200 mg/15 mL (test product) or a tablet (reference product),  separated by a 7-day washout period. Fifteen plasma samples were collected over  12 hours after drug administration. Plasma favipiravir levels were quantified  using in-house developed ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry. The test/reference geometric mean ratio along with 90%CI for the  maximum plasma concentration, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to  the time of the last quantifiable concentration, and AUC after single-dose  administration, extrapolated to infinity were 115.3% (90%CI, 107.7%-123.3%),  100.4% (90%CI, 96.9%-104.0%), and 100.4% (90%CI, 96.8%-104.2%), respectively.  These results were within the predefined acceptance criteria for bioequivalence  (80.0%-125.0%). No adverse events were observed in either group. The oral  solution formulation could offer the advantage of easier swallowing in broader  patient groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early antiviral treatment is effective for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) but currently available agents are expensive. Favipiravir is routinely  used in many countries, but efficacy is unproven. Antiviral combinations have not  been systematically studied. We aimed to evaluate the effect of favipiravir,  lopinavir-ritonavir or the combination of both agents on Severe Acute Respiratory  Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load trajectory when administered  early. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a Phase 2, proof of principle,  randomised, placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 factorial, double-blind trial of ambulatory  outpatients with early COVID-19 (within 7 days of symptom onset) at 2 sites in  the United Kingdom. Participants were randomised using a centralised online  process to receive: favipiravir (1,800 mg twice daily on Day 1 followed by 400 mg  4 times daily on Days 2 to 7) plus lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg twice daily  on Day 1, followed by 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily on Days 2 to 7), favipiravir  plus lopinavir-ritonavir placebo, lopinavir-ritonavir plus favipiravir placebo,  or both placebos. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 viral load at Day 5,  accounting for baseline viral load. Between 6 October 2020 and 4 November 2021,  we recruited 240 participants. For the favipiravir+lopinavir-ritonavir,  favipiravir+placebo, lopinavir-ritonavir+placebo, and placebo-only arms, we  recruited 61, 59, 60, and 60 participants and analysed 55, 56, 55, and 58  participants, respectively, who provided viral load measures at Day 1 and Day 5.  In the primary analysis, the mean viral load in the favipiravir+placebo arm had  changed by -0.57 log10 (95% CI -1.21 to 0.07, p = 0.08) and in the  lopinavir-ritonavir+placebo arm by -0.18 log10 (95% CI -0.82 to 0.46, p = 0.58)  compared to the placebo arm at Day 5. There was no significant interaction  between favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir (interaction coefficient term: 0.59  log10, 95% CI -0.32 to 1.50, p = 0.20). More participants had undetectable virus  at Day 5 in the favipiravir+placebo arm compared to placebo only (46.3% versus  26.9%, odds ratio (OR): 2.47, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.65; p = 0.03). Adverse events were  observed more frequently with lopinavir-ritonavir, mainly gastrointestinal  disturbance. Favipiravir drug levels were lower in the combination arm than the  favipiravir monotherapy arm, possibly due to poor absorption. The major  limitation was that the study population was relatively young and healthy  compared to those most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: At the  current doses, no treatment significantly reduced viral load in the primary  analysis. Favipiravir requires further evaluation with consideration of dose  escalation. Lopinavir-ritonavir administration was associated with lower plasma  favipiravir concentrations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04499677  EudraCT: 2020-002106-68.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is lack of universal agreement on the management of COVID-19. Intravenous high dose vitamin C (HDVC), remdesivir (RDV), and favipiravir (FPV)  have been suggested as part of the treatment regimens and only RDV is approved by  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so far. There is no study in Lebanon that  addresses the descriptive cohort of HDVC and antiviral therapy amongst COVID-19  inpatients. Our goal was to highlight such a cohort. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective  electronic chart review of COVID-19 inpatients was done over a period of 10  months (August 2020 to April 2021). Comparative data analysis was performed  between HDVC and non-HDVC (NHDVC) groups, and RDV and FPV groups. RESULTS: Among  HDVC patients, 70.1% (p = 0.035) and 67.2% (p = 0.008) had dyspnea and  desaturation respectively. Patients on HDVC were less likely to remain in  hospital for more than 20 days (p = 0.003). HDVC patients were more likely to be  on oxygen therapy with 74.7% (p = 0.002). RDV patients were more likely to be on  other COVID-19-related medications during hospitalization including the use of  tofacitinib, baricitinib, tocilizumab, and anticoagulation as recommended in the  guidelines. Statistical significance was noted for the status on discharge as  90.1% of the patients that received RDV were discharged after clinical  improvement, compared to the 74.2% of the FPV patients. CONCLUSIONS: Further  research is needed to establish local guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19. A  significant role of HDVC and FPV might resurface if randomized control trials are  conducted.

AB  - The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a promising drug target for coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19) because it plays the most important role in the replication of  the RNA genome. Nucleotide analogs such as remdesivir and favipiravir are thought  to interfere with the RNA replication by RdRp. More specifically, they are  expected to compete with nucleoside triphosphates, such as ATP. However, the  process in which these drug molecules and nucleoside triphosphates are taken up  by RdRp remains unknown. In this study, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics  simulations to clarify the recognition mechanism of RdRp for these drug molecules  and ATP that were at a distance. The ligand recognition ability of RdRp decreased  in the order of remdesivir, favipiravir, and ATP. We also identified six  recognition paths. Three of them were commonly found in all ligands, and the  remaining three paths were ligand-dependent ones. In the common two paths, it was  observed that the multiple lysine residues of RdRp carried the ligands to the  binding site like a "bucket brigade." In the remaining common path, the ligands  directly reached the binding site. Our findings contribute to the understanding  of the efficient ligand recognition by RdRp at the atomic level.

AB  - In the current work, a simple, economical, accurate, and precise HPLC method with UV detection was developed to quantify Favipiravir (FVIR) in spiked human plasma  using acyclovir (ACVR) as an internal standard in the COVID-19 pandemic time.  Both FVIR and ACVR were well separated and resolved on the C18 column using the  mobile phase blend of methanol:acetonitrile:20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3.1) in an  isocratic mode flow rate of 1 mL/min with a proportion of 30:10:60 %, v/v/v. The  detector wavelength was set at 242 nm. Maximum recovery of FVIR and ACVR from  plasma was obtained with dichloromethane (DCM) as extracting solvent. The  calibration curve was found to be linear in the range of 3.1-60.0 µg/mL with  regression coefficient (r(2)) = 0.9976. However, with acceptable r(2), the  calibration data's heteroscedasticity was observed, which was further reduced  using weighted linear regression with weighting factor 1/x. Finally, the method  was validated concerning sensitivity, accuracy (Inter and Intraday's % RE and RSD  were 0.28, 0.65 and 1.00, 0.12 respectively), precision, recovery (89.99%,  89.09%, and 90.81% for LQC, MQC, and HQC, respectively), stability (% RSD for  30-day were 3.04 and 1.71 for LQC and HQC, respectively at -20 °C), and  carry-over US-FDA guidance for Bioanalytical Method Validation for researchers in  the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Furthermore, there was no significant difference  for selectivity when evaluated at LLOQ concentration of 3 µg/mL of FVIR and  relative to the blank.

AB  - COVID-19 has intensified into a global pandemic with over a million deaths worldwide. Experimental research analyses have been implemented and executed with  the sole rationale to counteract SARS-CoV-2, which has initiated potent  therapeutic strategy development in coherence with computational biology  validation focusing on the characterized viral drug targets signified by  proteomic and genomic data. Spike glycoprotein is one of such potential drug  target that promotes viral attachment to the host cellular membrane by binding to  its receptor ACE-2 via its Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD). Multiple Sequence  alignment and relative phylogenetic analysis revealed significant sequential  disparities of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to previously encountered SARS-CoV and  MERS-CoV strains. We implemented a drug re-purposing approach wherein the  inhibitory efficacy of a cluster of thirty known drug candidates comprising of  antivirals, antibiotics and phytochemicals (selection contingent on their present  developmental status in underway clinical trials) was elucidated by subjecting  them to molecular docking analyses against the spike protein RBD model (developed  using homology modelling and validated using SAVES server 5.0) and the composite  trimeric structures of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicated  that Camostat, Favipiravir, Tenofovir, Raltegravir and Stavudine showed  significant interactions with spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Proficient bioavailability  coupled with no predicted in silico toxicity rendered them as prospective  alternatives for designing and development of novel combinatorial therapy  formulations for improving existing treatment regimes to combat COVID-19.

AB  - A novel electrochemical sensor is reported for the detection of the antiviral drug favipiravir based on the core-shell nanocomposite of flower-like molybdenum  disulfide (MoS(2)) nanospheres and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). The  MoS(2)@MIP core-shell nanocomposite was prepared via the electrodeposition of a  MIP layer on the MoS(2) modified electrode, using o-phenylenediamine as the  monomer and favipiravir as the template. The selective binding of target  favipiravir at the MoS(2)@MIP core-shell nanocomposite produced a redox signal in  a concentration dependent manner, which was used for the quantitative analysis.  The preparation process of the MoS(2)@MIP core-shell nanocomposite was optimized.  Under the optimal conditions, the sensor exhibited a wide linear response range  of 0.01 ~ 100 nM (1.57*10(-6) ~ 1.57*10(-2) μg mL(-1)) and a low detection limit  of 0.002 nM (3.14*10(-7) μg mL(-1)). Application of the sensor was demonstrated  by detecting favipiravir in a minimum amount of 10 μL biological samples (urine  and plasma). Satisfied results in the recovery tests indicated a high potential  of favipiravir monitoring in infectious COVID-19 samples.

AB  - Following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, a race was initiated to find a successful regimen for postinfections. Among those trials, a recent study  declared the efficacy of an antiviral combination of favipiravir (FAV) and  molnupiravir (MLP). The combined regimen helped in a successful 60% eradication  of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the lungs of studied hamster models. Moreover, it  prevented viral transmission to cohosted sentinels. Because both medications are  orally bioavailable, the coformulation of FAV and MLP can be predicted. The  developed study is aimed at developing new green and simple methods for the  simultaneous determination of FAV and MLP and then at their application in the  study of their dissolution behavior if coformulated together. A green micellar  HPLC method was validated using an RP-C18 core-shell column (5 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm)  and an isocratic mixed micellar mobile phase composed of 0.1 M SDS, 0.01 M  Brij-35, and 0.02 M monobasic potassium phosphate mixture and adjusted to pH 3.1  at 1.0 mL min(-1) flow rate. The analytes were detected at 230 nm. The run time  was less than five minutes under the optimized chromatographic conditions. Four  other multivariate chemometric model methods were developed and validated,  namely, classical least square (CLS), principal component regression (PCR),  partial least squares (PLS-1), and genetic algorithm-partial least squares  (GA-PLS-1). The developed models succeeded in resolving the great similarity and  overlapping in the FAV and MLP UV spectra unlike the traditional univariate  methods. All methods were organic solvent-free, did not require extraction or  derivatization steps, and were applied for the construction of the simultaneous  dissolution profile for FAV tablets and MLP capsules. The methods revealed that  the amount of the simultaneously released cited drugs increases up until reaching  a plateau after 15 and 20 min for FAV and MLP, respectively. The greenness was  assessed on GAPI and found to be in harmony with green analytical chemistry  concepts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of favipiravir in preventing disease progression in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains uncertain. We aimed to determine its  effect in preventing disease progression from nonhypoxia to hypoxia among  high-risk COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was an open-label, randomized clinical  trial conducted at 14 public hospitals across Malaysia (February-July 2021) among  500 symptomatic, RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, aged ≥50 years with ≥1  comorbidity, and hospitalized within first 7 days of illness. Patients were  randomized 1:1 to favipiravir plus standard care or standard care alone.  Favipiravir was administered at 1800 mg 2×/day on day 1 followed by 800 mg 2×/day  until day 5. The primary endpoint was rate of clinical progression from  nonhypoxia to hypoxia. Secondary outcomes included rates of mechanical  ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in-hospital mortality.  RESULTS: Of 500 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 62.5 [8.0] years; 258 women  [51.6%]; 251 [50.2%] had COVID-19 pneumonia), 487 (97.4%) patients completed the  trial. Clinical progression to hypoxia occurred in 46 (18.4%) patients on  favipiravir plus standard care and 37 (14.8%) on standard care alone (OR, 1.30;  95% CI: .81-2.09; P = .28). All 3 prespecified secondary endpoints were similar  between both groups. Mechanical ventilation occurred in 6 (2.4%) vs 5 (2.0%) (OR,  1.20; 95% CI: .36-4.23; P = .76), ICU admission in 13 (5.2%) vs 12 (4.8%) (OR,  1.09; 95% CI: .48-2.47; P = .84), and in-hospital mortality in 5 (2.0%) vs 0 (OR,  12.54; 95% CI: .76-207.84; P = .08) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among COVID-19  patients at high risk of disease progression, early treatment with oral  favipiravir did not prevent their disease progression from nonhypoxia to hypoxia.

AB  - In December 2019, a new coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from China, causing pneumonia outbreaks first  in the Wuhan region and has now spread worldwide. There are no specific drugs for  the disease caused by this virus, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  Considering that new synthesized drugs cannot be applied immediately to patients,  conventional drug in new use is a feasible solution. Chloroquine, remdesivir,  favipiravir, lopinavir, ribavirin, and ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit  coronavirus in vitro. Pentoxifylline, a drug with anti-inflammatory,  immunomodulatory, and bronchodilatory effects, has previously been shown to  inhibit several viral infections. Immunological studies have shown that most  patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit substantially elevated serum levels of  pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pentoxifylline is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that  increases the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which in turn activates  protein kinase, leading to a reduction in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory  cytokines and immune cell migration. Here, we propose pentoxifylline, a drug with  low cost and toxicity, as a possible treatment for COVID-19 based on its  interesting properties.

AB  - COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern. Although considerable knowledge has been acquired with time about the viral mechanism of  infection and mode of replication, yet no specific drugs or vaccines have been  discovered against SARS-CoV-2 to date. There are few small molecule antiviral  drugs like Remdesivir and Favipiravir, which have shown promising results in  different advanced stages of clinical trials. Chloroquinine, Hydroxychloroquine,  and Lopinavir- Ritonavir combination, although initially were hypothesized to be  effective against SARSCoV- 2, are now discontinued from the solidarity clinical  trials. This review provides a brief description of their chemical syntheses  along with their mode of action, and clinical trial results available on Google  and in different peer-reviewed journals till 24th October 2020.

AB  - AIM: To determine whether convalescent angiotensin (1-7) peptide replacement therapy with plasma (peptide plasma) transfusion can be beneficial in the  treatment of critically ill patients with severe coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  infection. STUDY DESIGN: Case series of 9 critically ill patients with  laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia  with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral  treatment. Peptide plasma: Plasma with angiotensin (1-7) content 8-10 times  higher than healthy plasma donors was obtained from suitable donors. Peptide  plasma transfusion was applied to 9 patients whose clinical status and/or  laboratory profile deteriorated and who needed intensive care for 2 days.  RESULTS: In our COVID-19 cases, favipiravir, low molecular weight heparin  treatment, which is included in the treatment protocol of the ministry of health,  was started. Nine patients with oxygen saturation of 93% and below despite nasal  oxygen support, whose clinical and/or laboratory deteriorated, were identified.  The youngest of the cases was 36 years old, and the oldest patient was 85 years  old. 6 of the 9 cases had male gender. 3 cases had been smoking for more than 10  years. 4 cases had at least one chronic disease. In all of our cases, SARS CoV2  lung involvement was bilateral and peptide plasma therapy was administered in  cases when oxygen saturation was 93% and below despite nasal oxygen support of 5  liters/minute and above, and intensive care was required. Although it was not  reflected in the laboratory parameters in the early period, 8 patients whose  saturations improved with treatment were discharged without the need for  intensive care. However, a similar response was not obtained in one case. Oxygen  requirement increased gradually and, he died in intensive care process. An  increase of the platelet count was observed in all cases following the peptide  plasma treatment. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary case series of 9 critically ill  patients with COVID-19, administration of plasma containing angiotensin (1-7) was  followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and  study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of  this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread across the globe, with numerous clinical trials underway seeking to develop and test effective COVID-19  therapies, including remdesivir. Several ongoing studies have reported  hydroxychloroquine-induced cardiotoxicity, including development of torsade de  pointes (TdP). Meanwhile, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived  cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are expected to serve as a tool for assessing  drug-induced cardiotoxicity, such as TdP and contraction impairment. However, the  cardiotoxicity of COVID-19 treatments has not been fully assessed using  hiPSC-CMs. In this study, we focused on drug repurposing with various modes of  actions and examined the TdP risk associated with COVID-19 treatments using field  potential using multi-electrode array system and motion analysis with hiPSC-CMs.  Hydroxychloroquine induced early after depolarization, while remdesivir,  favipiravir, camostat, and ivermectin had little effect on field potentials. We  then analyzed electromechanical window, which is defined as the difference  between field potential and contraction-relaxation durations. Hydroxychloroquine  decreased electromechanical window of hiPSC-CMs in a concentration-dependent  manner. In contrast, other drugs had little effect. Our data suggest that  hydroxychloroquine has proarrhythmic risk and other drugs have low proarrhythmic  risk. Thus, hiPSC-CMs represent a useful tool for assessing the comprehensive  cardiotoxicity caused by COVID-19 treatments in nonclinical settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019. Until now, many drugs and methods have been used in  the treatment of the disease. However, no effective treatment option has been  found and only case-based successes have been achieved so far. This study aims to  evaluate COVID-19 treatment options using multicriteria decision-making (MCDM)  techniques. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the available COVID-19 treatment  options by MCDM techniques, namely, fuzzy PROMETHEE and VIKOR. These techniques  are based on the evaluation and comparison of complex and multiple criteria to  evaluate the most appropriate alternative. We evaluated current treatment options  including favipiravir (FPV), lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine,  interleukin-1 blocker, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and plasma exchange.  The criteria used for the analysis include side effects, method of administration  of the drug, cost, turnover of plasma, level of fever, age, pregnancy, and kidney  function. RESULTS: The results showed that plasma exchange was the most preferred  alternative, followed by FPV and IVIG, while hydroxychloroquine was the least  favorable one. New alternatives could be considered once they are available, and  weights could be assigned based on the opinions of the decision-makers  (physicians/clinicians). The treatment methods that we evaluated with MCDM  methods will be beneficial for both healthcare users and to rapidly end the  global pandemic. The proposed method is applicable for analyzing the alternatives  to the selection problem with quantitative and qualitative data. In addition, it  allows the decision-maker to define the problem simply under uncertainty.  CONCLUSIONS: Fuzzy PROMETHEE and VIKOR techniques are applied in aiding  decision-makers in choosing the right treatment technique for the management of  COVID-19.

AB  - We describe a case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a patient with mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) undergoing brentuximab vedotin,  doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A+AVD) therapy. A 43-year-old man  presented to our hospital with a complaint of fever, for which he was diagnosed  with COVID-19 after a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and antiviral therapy with  favipiravir and ciclesonide was started subsequently. The fever persisted for the  first few days of treatment, but his respiratory status was stable, and he became  asymptomatic and afebrile on day 9. Although the PCR tests remained positive, he  met the updated discharge criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) on day  12. However, his fever recurred, and his condition worsened on day 16. A chest  X-ray showed a new opacity. It is likely that favipiravir and ciclesonide  treatment probably did not completely eliminate the virus in the patient, and  therefore the infection persisted. We added remdesivir from day 21, and the  improvement was remarkable. He was discharged on day 29 after two consecutive PCR  test results were negative. PCR tests are not mandatory for the updated WHO  discharge criteria. However, even after antiviral therapy, COVID-19 patients with  hematologic malignancies may have prolonged active infection with impaired viral  excretion. Depending on the background disease and comorbidities, there may be  some patient populations for whom it is not appropriate to simply comply with the  current discharge criteria. Therefore, more emphasis may be needed on PCR  examinations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are some data showing that repurposed drugs used for the Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) have potential to increase the risk of QTc  prolongation and torsade de pointes (TdP), and these arrhythmic side effects have  not been adequately addressed in COVID-19 patients treated with these repurposed  medications. METHODS: This is the prospective study of 2403 patients hospitalised  at 13 hospitals within the COVID-19 epicentres of the Iran. These patients were  treated with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir,  atazanavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, favipiravir and remdesivir alone or in  combination with azithromycin. The primary outcome of the study was incidence of  critical QTc prolongation, and secondary outcomes were incidences of TdP and  death. RESULTS: Of the 2403 patients, 2365 met inclusion criteria. The primary  outcome of QTc ≥ 500 ms and ∆QTc ≥ 60 ms was observed in 11.2% and 17.6% of the  patients, respectively. The secondary outcomes of TdP and death were reported in  0.38% and 9.8% of the patients, respectively. The risk of critical QT  prolongation increased in the presence of female gender, history of heart  failure, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin combination therapy,  simultaneous furosemide or beta-blocker therapy and acute renal or hepatic  dysfunction. However, the risk of TdP was predicted by treatment with  lopinavir-ritonavir, simultaneous amiodarone or furosemide administration and  hypokalaemia during treatment. CONCLUSION: This cohort showed significant QTc  prolongation with all COVID-19 medications studied, however, life-threatening  arrhythmia of TdP occurred rarely. Among the repurposed drugs studied,  hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir alone or in combination with  azithromycin clearly demonstrated to increase the risk of critical QT  prolongation and/or TdP.

AB  - Favipiravir is a promising antiviral agent that has been recently approved for treatment of COVID-19 infection. In this study, a menthol-assisted homogenous  liquid-liquid microextraction method has been developed for favipiravir  determination in human plasma using HPLC/UV. The different factors that could  affect the extraction efficiency were studied, including extractant type,  extractant volume, menthol amount and vortex time. The optimum extraction  efficiency was achieved using 300 µL of tetrahydrofuran, 30 mg of menthol and  vortexing for 1 min before centrifuging the sample for 5 min at 3467g. Addition  of menthol does not only induce phase separation, but also helps to form reverse  micelles to facilitate extraction. The highly polar favipiravir molecules would  be incorporated into the hydrophilic core of the formed reverse micelle to be  extracted by the non-polar organic extractant. The method was validated according  to the FDA bioanalytical method guidelines. The developed method was found linear  in the concentration range of 0.1 to 100 µg/mL with a coefficient of  determination of 0.9992. The method accuracy and precision were studied by  calculating the recovery (%) and the relative standard deviation (%),  respectively. The recovery (%) was in the range of 97.1-103.9%, while the RSD (%)  values ranged between 2.03 and 8.15 %. The developed method was successfully  applied in a bioequivalence study of Flupirava® 200 mg versus Avigan® 200 mg,  after a single oral dose of favipiravir administered to healthy adult volunteers.  The proposed method was simple, cheap, more eco-friendly and sufficiently  sensitive for biomedical application.

AB  - AIM: During the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the physicians are using various off-label therapeutics to manage COVID-19. We undertook a  cross-sectional survey to study the current variation in therapeutic strategies  for managing severe COVID-19 in India. METHODS: From January 4 to January 18,  2021, an online cross-sectional survey was conducted among physicians involved in  the management of severe COVID-19. The survey had three sections: 1. Antiviral  agents, 2. Immunomodulators, and 3. Adjuvant therapies. RESULTS: 1055 respondents  (from 24 states and five union territories), of which 64.2% were consultants,  54.3% working in private hospitals, and 39.1% were from critical care medicine  completed the survey. Remdesivir (95.2%), antithrombotics (94.2%),  corticosteroids (90.3%), vitamins (89.7%) and empirical antibiotics (85.6%) were  the commonly used therapeutics. Ivermectin (33%), convalescent plasma (28.6%) and  favipiravir (17.6%) were other antiviral agents used. Methylprednisolone (50.2%)  and dexamethasone (44.1%) were preferred corticosteroids and at a dose equivalent  of 8 mg of dexamethasone phosphate (70.2%). There was significant variation among  physicians from different medical specialities in the use of favipiravir,  corticosteroids, empirical antibiotics and vitamins. CONCLUSION: There is a  considerable variation in the physicians' choice of therapeutic strategies for  the management of severe COVID-19 in India, as compared with the available  evidence.

AB  - The two RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors remdesivir and favipiravir were originally developed and approved as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for the  treatment of harmful viral infections such as Ebola and influenza. With the  outbreak of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the two drugs were repurposed for the  treatment of COVID-19 patients. Clinical studies suggested that the efficacy of  the drugs is enhanced in the case of an early or even prophylactic application.  Because the contact between drug molecules and the plasma membrane is essential  for a successful permeation process of the substances and therefore for their  intracellular efficiency, drug-induced effects on the membrane structure are  likely and have already been shown for other substances. We investigated the  impact of remdesivir and favipiravir on lipid bilayers in model and cell  membranes via several biophysical approaches. The measurements revealed that the  embedding of remdesivir molecules in the lipid bilayer results in a disturbance  of the membrane structure of the tested phospholipid vesicles. Nevertheless, in a  cell-based assay, the presence of remdesivir induced only weak hemolysis of the  treated erythrocytes. In contrast, no experimental indication for an effect on  the structure and integrity of the membrane was detected in the case of  favipiravir. Regarding potential prophylactic or accompanying use of the drugs in  the therapy of COVID-19, the physiologically relevant impacts associated with the  drug-induced structural modifications of the membrane might be important to  understand side effects and/or low effectivities.

AB  - The diffusion of drugs into the cellular membrane is an important step in the drug delivery systems. Furthermore, predicting the interaction and permeability  of drugs across the cellular membrane could help scientists to design  bioavailable and high-efficient drugs. Discovering the COVID-19 drugs has  recently drawn remarkable attention to tackle its outbreak. Due to the rapid  replication of the coronavirus in the human body, searching for highly permeable  drugs into the cellular membrane is vital. Herein, we performed the molecular  dynamics (MD) simulation and density functional (DFT) calculations to investigate  the permeability of keto and enol tautomers of the favipiravir (FAV) as well as  hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) COVID-19 drugs into the cellular membrane. Our results  reveal that though both keto and enol tautomers of the FAV are feasible to  transfer through the cellular membrane, the keto form moves faster and diffuses  deeper; however, the HCQ molecules aggregate in the water phase and remain near  the cellular membrane. It is worth pointing out that the obtained results are  consistent with the reactivity trends projected by the calculated reactivity  descriptors of the considered drugs. Despite the pair correlation function and  H-bond analyses revealing the interactions between the membrane and HCQ, the  aggregation of the HCQ molecules resists their passage through the cellular  membrane. Besides, the lower free energy barrier of FAV confirms its higher  permeability than HCQ. These findings suggest that due to the deeper permeability  of the FAV drug, its effectiveness can be more than that of HCQ. These molecular  insights might help with a better understanding of the interactions between  COVID-19 drugs and cellular membranes. Moreover, these theoretical findings could  help experimental researchers find high-efficient strategies for COVID-19  therapy.

AB  - The proverb "Old is gold" is applicable in drug discovery and the proverb "All that Glitters is not Gold" is also appropriate. In the COVID-19 era, there has  been a race for drugs to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. There are reports about  the uses of Remdesivir and Favipiravir as existing antivirals against virus but  none have been conclusive so far. In the attempts for innovations, the  combination of drugs is also under trials. Therefore, we used the density  functional theory method and quantum theory of atoms in molecules to investigate  drug-drug interactions involving Remdesivir and Favipiravir. The computed  parameters were related to the antiviral actions of both drugs together. The  results indicate enhanced antiviral activity and it will be worthy to consider  additional investigations with the combination of these two drugs.

AB  - Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) currently being used to manage COVID-19. Accumulation of mutations in  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RdRp may facilitate  antigenic drift, generating favipiravir resistance. Focussing on the  chain-termination mechanism utilized by favipiravir, we used high-throughput  interface-based protein design to generate > 100 000 designs of the  favipiravir-binding site of RdRp and identify mutational hotspots. We identified  several single-point mutants and designs having a sequence identity of 97%-98%  with wild-type RdRp, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can develop favipiravir  resistance with few mutations. Out of 134 mutations documented in the CoV-GLUE  database, 63 specific mutations were already predicted as resistant in our  calculations, thus attaining ˜ 47% correlation with the sequencing data. These  findings improve our understanding of the potential signatures of adaptation in  SARS-CoV-2 against favipiravir.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Favipiravir is an antiviral agent that is recently used for SARS-CoV2 infection. The drug-drug interactions of favipiravir especially with  chemotherapeutic agents in a patient with malignancy are not well known. CASE  REPORT: The patient diagnosed with metastatic osteosarcoma was given high dose  methotrexate treatment, and favipiravir was started on the third day of the  treatment with suspicion of SARS-CoV2 infection. Grade 3 hepatotoxicity developed  after favipiravir.Management & outcome: The acute viral hepatitis panel and  autoimmune liver disease panel were negative. The ultrasound of the abdomen was  unremarkable for any hepatobiliary pathology. The all viral and hepatobiliary  possible etiological factors were ruled out. The patient's liver enzymes  increased just after (12 hours later) the initiation of favipiravir, and we  diagnosed toxic hepatitis caused by favipiravir-methotrexate interaction.  Therefore, methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg dose was started for a presumed diagnosis  of toxic hepatitis. Hepatotoxicity completely regressed after favipiravir was  discontinued. DISCUSSION: Favipiravir may inhibit methotrexate elimination by  inhibiting aldehyde oxidase and its sequential use may cause hepatotoxicity in  this case. The clinicians should keep in mind possible drug interactions while  using new antiviral agents against SARS-CoV2 like favipiravir.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies have been published about critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the early phases of the pandemic but the  characteristic or survival of critically ill Japanese patients have not yet been  investigated. We sought to investigate the characteristics, inflammatory  laboratory finding trends, and outcomes among critically ill Japanese patients  who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with the first wave of  COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed in a single  institution in the center of Tokyo. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients  admitted to the ICU from March 19 to April 30, 2020 were included. Trends for  significant inflammatory laboratory findings were analyzed. In-hospital death,  days of mechanical ventilation or oxygen supplementation, days of ICU or hospital  stay were followed until May 26, 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were  included. Median age was 57.5 years, and 79% were male. The  neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was elevated to a median of 10.1 on admission and  peaked on Day 10 of illness. Seventeen patients were intubated on Day 11 of  illness and received mechanical ventilation. One patient underwent extracorporeal  membrane oxygenation. The majority (88%) received systemic steroids, including 16  patients who received high dose methylprednisolone (500-1000 mg). Favipiravir was  used in 38% of patients. Two patients, including 1 who refused intensive care,  died. Eighteen patients were discharged. Median length of ICU and hospital stay  for all patients was 6 and 22 days, respectively. Median length of ventilator  dependency was 7 days. Four patients underwent a tracheostomy and received  prolonged ventilation for more than 21 days. One patient receiving mechanical  ventilation died. All survivors discontinued ventilator use. CONCLUSIONS:  Mortality was remarkably low in our single institutional study. Three survivors  received mechanical ventilation for more than 3 weeks. Trends of clinically  significant laboratory markers reflected the clinical course of COVID-19.

AB  - There is an urgent need to identify optimal antiviral therapies for COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. We have conducted a rapid and comprehensive review of  relevant pharmacological evidence, focusing on (1) the pharmacokinetics (PK) of  potential antiviral therapies; (2) coronavirus-specific pharmacodynamics (PD);  (3) PK and PD interactions between proposed combination therapies; (4)  pharmacology of major supportive therapies; and (5) anticipated drug-drug  interactions (DDIs). We found promising in vitro evidence for remdesivir,  (hydroxy)chloroquine and favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2; potential clinical  benefit in SARS-CoV-2 with remdesivir, the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir  (LPV/r) plus ribavirin; and strong evidence for LPV/r plus ribavirin against  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) for post-exposure prophylaxis in  healthcare workers. Despite these emerging data, robust controlled clinical  trials assessing patient-centred outcomes remain imperative and clinical data  have already reduced expectations with regard to some drugs. Any therapy should  be used with caution in the light of potential drug interactions and the  uncertainty of optimal doses for treating mild versus serious infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pharmacokinetics and appropriate dose regimens of favipiravir are unknown in hospitalized influenza patients; such data are also needed to  determine dosage selection for favipiravir trials in COVID-19. METHODS: In this  dose-escalating study, favipiravir pharmacokinetics and tolerability were  assessed in critically ill influenza patients. Participants received one of two  dosing regimens; Japan licensed dose (1600 mg BID on day 1 and 600 mg BID on the  following days) and the higher dose (1800 mg/800 mg BID) trialed in uncomplicated  influenza. The primary pharmacokinetic endpoint was the proportion of patients  with a minimum observed plasma trough concentration (C(trough)) ≥20 mg/L at all  measured time points after the second dose. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were  enrolled into the low dose group and 19 patients into the high dose group of the  study. Favipiravir C(trough) decreased significantly over time in both groups (p  <0.01). Relative to day 2 (48 hrs), concentrations were 91.7% and 90.3% lower in  the 1600/600 mg group and 79.3% and 89.5% lower in the 1800/800 mg group at day 7  and 10, respectively. In contrast, oseltamivir concentrations did not change  significantly over time. A 2-compartment disposition model with first-order  absorption and elimination described the observed favipiravir concentration-time  data well. Modeling demonstrated that less than 50% of patients achieved  C(trough) ≥20 mg/L for >80% of the duration of treatment of the two dose regimens  evaluated (18.8% and 42.1% of patients for low and high dose regimen,  respectively). Increasing the favipravir dosage predicted a higher proportion of  patients reaching this threshold of 20 mg/L, suggesting that dosing regimens of  ≥3600/2600 mg might be required for adequate concentrations. The two dosing  regimens were well-tolerated in critical ill patients with influenza. CONCLUSION:  The two dosing regimens proposed for uncomplicated influenza did not achieve our  pre-defined treatment threshold.

AB  - Outbreaks due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona virus 2 (SARSCoV- 2) initiated in Wuhan city, China, in December 2019 and continued to spread  Internationally, posing a pandemic threat as declared by WHO and as of March 10,  2021, confirmed cases reached 118 million along with 2.6 million deaths  worldwide. In the absence of specific antiviral medication, symptomatic treatment  and physical isolation remain the options to control the disease and contagion.  The recent clinical trials on antiviral drugs highlighted some promising  compounds such as umifenovir (haemagglutininand has only 70% similarity to  SAmediated fusion inhibitor), remdesivir (RdRp nucleoside inhibitor), and  favipiravir (RdRp Inhibitor). WHO launched a multinational clinical trial on  several promising analogs as a potential treatment to combat SARS infection. This  situation urges a holistic approach to invent safe and specific drugs as a  prophylactic and therapeutic cure for SARS-related viral diseases, including  COVID-19. It is significant to note that researchers worldwide have been doing  their best to handle the crisis and have produced an extensive and promising  literature body. It opens a scope and allows understanding the viral entry at the  molecular level. A structure-based approach can reveal the molecular-level  understanding of viral entry interaction. The ligand profiling and non-covalent  interactions among participating amino-acid residues are critical information to  delineate a structural interpretation. The structural investigation of SARS virus  entry into host cells will reveal the possible strategy for designing drugs like  entry inhibitors. The structure-based approach demonstrates details at the 3D  molecular level. It shows specificity about SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction, which  uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry, and  the human protease completes the process of viral fusion and infection. The 3D  structural studies reveal the existence of two units, namely S1 and S2. S1 is  called a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and responsible for interacting with the  host (ACE2), and the S2 unit participates in the fusion of viral and cellular  membranes. TMPRSS2 mediates the cleavage at the S1/S2 subunit interface in the  S-protein of SARS CoV-2, leading to viral fusion. Conformational difference  associated with S1 binding alters ACE2 interaction and inhibits viral fusion.  Overall, the detailed 3D structural studies help understand the 3D structural  basis of interaction between viruses with host factors and open scope for the new  drug discovery process targeting SARS-related virus entry into the host cell.

We retrospectively analyzed the differences between patients with nosocomial  COVID-19 and either hematological disease (n=40) or other diseases (n=57). The  analysis was completed within 60 days for surviving patients. Among the patients  with hematological disease and those with other diseases, there were 21 (52.5%)  and 20 (35.1%) deaths, respectively. Although the patients with hematological  disease received favipiravir more frequently than patients with other diseases  (21 [52.5%] vs. 15 [35.3%], respectively; P<0.05), their median overall survival  was poor (29 days; P=0.078). Furthermore, the median duration from oxygen therapy  initiation to death or intubation was significantly shorter in the patients with  hematological disease (5 days [range, 1-17 days] vs. 10 days [1-24 days],  respectively; P<0.05). Furthermore, the patients with hematological disease and  nosocomial COVID-19 exhibited more marked respiratory failure and poorer outcomes  leading to death in a shorter time period than the patients with other diseases  and nosocomial COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been declared as a global pandemic by WHO. Comprehensive analysis of this unprecedented outbreak may help to fight  against the disease and may play a pivotal role in decreasing the mortality rate  linked with it. Papain-like protease (PLpro), a multifunctional polyprotein,  facilitates the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and evades it from the host  immunological response by antagonizing cytokines, interferons and may be  considered as a potential drug target to combat the current pandemic. METHODS:  Natural moieties obtained from medicinal plants were analysed for their potency  to target PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular docking study and were compared with  synthetic analogs named as remdesivir, chloroquine and favipiravir. The stability  of complexes of top hits was analysed by MD Simulation, and interaction energy  was calculated. Furthermore, average RMSD values were computed and deepsite  ligand-binding pockets were predicted using Play Molecule. Drug-like-abilities of  these moieties were determined using ADMET and bond distance between the ligand  and active site was assessed to predict the strength of the interaction. RESULTS:  Nimbocinol (-7.6 Kcal/mol) and sage (-7.3 Kcal/mol) exhibited maximum BA against  PLpro SARS-CoV-2 as evident from molecular docking study, which was found to be  even better than remdesivir (-6.1 Kcal/mol), chloroquine (-5.3 Kcal/mol) and  favipiravir (-5.7 Kcal/mol). Both nimbocinol- PLpro and sage-PLpro SARS-CoV-2  complex exhibited stable conformation during MD Simulation of 101ns at 310 K, and  potential, kinetic and electrostatic interaction energies were computed, which  was observed to be concordant with results of molecular docking study. RMSD  average values were found to be 0.496 ± 0.015 Å and 0.598 ± 0.023 Å for  nimbocinol and sage, respectively, thus revealing that both the deviation and  fluctuations during MD Simulation were observed to be least. Deepsite prediction  disclosed that both compounds occupied cryptic pockets in receptor and non-bond  distance analysis revealed the formation of hydrogen bonds during ligand-receptor  interaction. ADMET exploration further validated the drug-like properties of  these compounds. CONCLUSION: Present study revealed that active constituents of  Azadirachta indica and Salvia officinalis can be potentially used to target  SARS-CoV-2 by hindering its replication process.

AB  - We treated two patients with severe respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Case 1 was a 73-year-old woman, and Case 2 was a  65-year-old-man. Neither of them had a history of autoimmune disease. Chest  computed tomography scans before the antiviral therapy showed bilateral multiple  patchy ground-glass opacities (GGO) consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. The GGO  regressed over the course of the antiviral treatment; however, new non-segmental  patchy consolidations emerged, which resembled those of interstitial lung disease  (ILD), specifically collagen vascular disease-associated ILD. We tested the  patients' sera for autoantibodies and discovered that both patients had high  anti-SSA/Ro antibody titers. In Case 1, the patient recovered with antiviral  therapy alone. However, in Case 2, the patient did not improve with antiviral  therapy alone but responded well to corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone)  and made a full recovery. The relationship between some immunological responses  and COVID-19 pneumonia exacerbation has been discussed previously; our discovery  of the elevation of anti-SSA/Ro antibodies suggests a contribution from  autoimmunity functions of the immune system. Although it is unclear whether the  elevation of anti-SSA/Ro antibodies was a cause or an outcome of aggravated  COVID-19 pneumonia, we hypothesize that both patients developed aggravated the  COVID-19 pneumonia due to an autoimmune response. In COVID-19 lung injury, there  may be a presence of autoimmunity factors in addition to the known effects of  cytokine storms. In patients with COVID-19, a high level of anti-SSA/Ro52  antibodies may be a surrogate marker of pneumonia severity and poor prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The world is currently under the threat of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, caused by SARS-CoV-2. The objective of the  present investigation was to repurpose the drugs with potential antiviral  activity against receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein  among 56 commercially available drugs. Therefore, an integrative computational  approach, using molecular docking, quantum chemical calculation and molecular  dynamics, was performed to unzip the effective drug-target interactions between  RBD and 56 commercially available drugs. METHODS: The present in silico approach  was based on information of drugs and experimentally derived crystal structure of  RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Molecular docking analysis was performed for RBD  against all 56 reported drugs using AutoDock 4.2 tool to screen the drugs with  better potential antiviral activity which were further analysed by other  computational tools for repurposing potential drug or drugs for COVID-19  therapeutics. RESULTS: Drugs such as chalcone, grazoprevir, enzaplatovir,  dolutegravir, daclatasvir, tideglusib, presatovir, remdesivir and simeprevir were  predicted to be potentially effective antiviral drugs against RBD and could have  good COVID-19 therapeutic efficacy. Simeprevir displayed the highest binding  affinity and reactivity against RBD with the values of -8.52 kcal/mol (binding  energy) and 9.254 kcal/mol (band energy gap) among all the 56 drugs under  investigation. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: In the current investigation,  simeprevir was identified as the potential antiviral drug based on the in silico  findings in comparison to remdesivir, favipiravir and other 53 drugs. Further,  laboratory and clinical investigations are needed to be carried out which will  aid in the development of quick therapeutics designed for COVID-19.

AB  - Favipiravir, molnupiravir, and ritonavir have been recently approved as the first oral antivirals for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 viral infections. Their combination  was reported in several clinical studies, alternatively, to enhance the viral  eradication and improve patient's recovery times and rates. Being all orally  administered, therefore, the development of new sensitive and validated  methodologies for their simultaneous determination is a necessitate. In the  proposed research, a sensitive, selective, and simple high-performance thin layer  chromatography method was developed and validated for determination of  favipiravir, molnupiravir, and ritonavir. Silica gel 60F254 thin layer  chromatography plates were used as stationary phase for this separation using  mobile phase composed of methylene chloride:ethyl acetate:methanol:25% ammonia  (6:3:4:1, v/v/v/v). Densitometric detection was performed at wavelength 289 nm.  Peaks of favipiravir, molnupiravir, and ritonavir were resolved at retention  factors 0.22, 0.42, and 0.63, respectively. The proposed method was found linear  within the specified ranges of 3.75-100.00 μg/mL for molnupiravir and  favipiravir, and 2.75-100.00 μg/mL for ritonavir. Limits of detection were found  to be 1.12, 1.21, and 0.89 μg/mL for favipiravir, molnupiravir, and ritonavir,  respectively. This is the first method to be reported for the simultaneous  determination of the cited three antiviral drugs. The method was assessed on  novel greenness metrics.

T2  - BMC infectious diseases
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a broad spectrum from respiratory and nasopharyngeal symptoms, cerebrovascular diseases, impaired  consciousness, and skeletal muscle injury. Emerging evidence has indicated the  neural spread of this novel coronavirus. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common  neurological, sensorimotor disorder, but highly under diagnosis disorder.  Restless anal syndrome as restless legs syndrome variant associated with COVID-19  has been previously not published. We report a case presenting with restless anal  syndrome following COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: Although a 77-year-old male with  COVID-19 improved to normal respiratory function 21 days after admission and  treatment of favipiravir 200 mg per day for 14 days and dexamethasone 6.6 mg per  day for 5 days, the insomnia and anxiety symptoms remained. Several weeks after  discharge, he gradually began to experience restless, deep anal discomfort,  approximately 10 cm from the perineal region. The following features were  observed in the anal region; urge to move is essential, with worsening with rest,  improvement with exercise, and worsening at evening. Colonoscopy revealed  internal haemorrhoids without other rectal lesions. Neurological findings  including deep tendon reflex, perineum loss of sensory and spinal cord injury,  revealed no abnormalities. Diabetes militias, kidney dysfunction and iron  deficiency status were not confirmed. Family history of RLS and periodic limb  movements were not observed. Clonazepam at 1.5 mg per day resulted in the  alleviation restless anal discomfort. CONCLUSIONS: We reported a case presenting  with restless anal syndrome following affection of COVID-19 as restless legs  syndrome variant. This case fulfilled 4 essential features of RLS, urge to move,  worsening with rest, improvement with exercise, and worsening at evening. To  date, no case of restless anal syndrome associated with COVID-19 has been  previously published. This case report may reflect the associative impacts of  COVID-19 on the neuropsychiatric state. The long-term outcomes of  neuropsychiatric conditions should continue to be monitored.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This critical appraisal aims to clarify which systematic reviews on COVID-19 treatment are based on high-value evidence. Hereby, the most profitable  medicines can be suggested. METHODS: The mesh terms of "COVID-19 drug treatment"  (Supplementary Concept) and "COVID-19 drug treatment" were sequentially utilized  as search strategies in Medline and Science direct on October 18, 2020. Searches  were confined to systematic reviews/meta-analyses. The Cochrane database was  searched on November 1, 2020 with "COVID." With adding up four articles from  other resources, 84 systematic reviews were considered for initial screening.  Finally, 22 articles fulfilled the criteria and were assessed using PRISMA  guidelines. RESULTS: Increasing number of clinical trials from the onset of the  COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not  only profitable but also deleterious. Lopinavir/ritonavir failed to maintain  their initial efficacy in improving clinical symptoms and mortality rate.  Steroids and tocilizumab were suggested in patients with intensely severe  symptoms. Steroids reduced mechanical ventilation and death in severely ill  patients. Plasma or immunoglobulins effects are absolutely controversial.  Favorable impressions of remdesivir have been relied on for the early onset of  this drug. Hypotension and abnormal liver function tests were realized as its  side effects. Favipiravir has resulted in a higher viral clearance than  remdesivir. However, this claim needs to be proved with subsequent clinical  trials. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, remdesivir and favipiravir are advantageous drugs  that should be administered in the early phases. Their side effects are not well  known and need to be found in the following research projects. Steroids and  tocilizumab have been considered beneficial in the cytokine storm phase.

TI  - Ritonavir may inhibit exoribonuclease activity of nsp14 from the SARS-CoV-2 virus and potentiate the activity of chain terminating drugs.
AU  - Narayanan, Naveen
AU  - Nair, Deepak T.
T2  - International journal of biological macromolecules
AB  - SARS-CoV-2is the causative agent for the ongoing COVID19 pandemic, and this virus belongs to the Coronaviridae family. The nsp14 protein of SARS-CoV-2 houses a 3'  to 5' exoribonuclease activity responsible for removing mismatches that arise  during genome duplication. A homology model of nsp10-nsp14 complex was used to  carry out in silico screening to identify molecules among natural products, or  FDA approved drugs that can potentially inhibit the activity of nsp14. This  exercise showed that ritonavir might bind to the exoribonuclease active site of  the nsp14 protein. A model of the SARS-CoV-2-nsp10-nsp14 complex bound to  substrate RNA showed that the ritonavir binding site overlaps with that of the 3'  nucleotide of substrate RNA. A comparison of the calculated energies of binding  for RNA and ritonavir suggested that the drug may bind to the active site of  nsp14 with significant affinity. It is, therefore, possible that ritonavir may  prevent association with substrate RNA and thus inhibit the exoribonuclease  activity of nsp14. Overall, our computational studies suggest that ritonavir may  serve as an effective inhibitor of the nsp14 protein. nsp14 is known to attenuate  the inhibitory effect of drugs that function through premature termination of  viral genome replication. Hence, ritonavir may potentiate the therapeutic  properties of drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir and ribavirin.

AB  - We collected a multi-centric retrospective dataset of patients (N = 213) who were admitted to ten hospitals in Czech Republic and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2  during the early phases of the pandemic in March-October 2020. The dataset  contains baseline patient characteristics, breathing support required,  pharmacological treatment received and multiple markers on daily resolution.  Patients in the dataset were treated with hydroxychloroquine (N = 108),  azithromycin (N = 72), favipiravir (N = 9), convalescent plasma (N = 7),  dexamethasone (N = 4) and remdesivir (N = 3), often in combination. To explore  association between treatments and patient outcomes we performed multiverse  analysis, observing how the conclusions change between defensible choices of  statistical model, predictors included in the model and other analytical degrees  of freedom. Weak evidence to constrain the potential efficacy of azithromycin and  favipiravir can be extracted from the data. Additionally, we performed external  validation of several proposed prognostic models for Covid-19 severity showing  that they mostly perform unsatisfactorily on our dataset.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Myasthenia gravis (MG) patients could be a vulnerable group in the pandemic era of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) mainly due to  respiratory muscle weakness, older age and long-term immunosuppressive treatment.  We aimed to define factors predicting the severity of COVID-19 in MG patients and  risk of MG exacerbation during COVID-19. METHODS: We evaluated clinical features  and outcomes after COVID-19 in 93 MG patients. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients  (38%) had severe pneumonia and we recorded 10 deaths (11%) due to COVID-19.  Higher forced vital capacity (FVC) values tested before COVID-19 were shown to be  protective against severe infection (95% CI 0.934-0.98) as well as good control  of MG measured by the quantified myasthenia gravis score (95% CI 1.047-1.232).  Long-term chronic corticosteroid treatment worsened the course of COVID-19 in MG  patients (95% CI 1.784-111.43) and this impact was positively associated with  dosage (p = 0.005). Treatment using azathioprine (95% CI 0.448-2.935),  mycophenolate mofetil (95% CI 0.91-12.515) and ciclosporin (95% CI 0.029-2.212)  did not influence the course of COVID-19. MG patients treated with rituximab had  a high risk of death caused by COVID-19 (95% CI 3.216-383.971). Exacerbation of  MG during infection was relatively rare (15%) and was not caused by remdesivir,  convalescent plasma or favipiravir (95% CI 0.885-10.87). CONCLUSIONS: As the most  important predictors of severe COVID-19 in MG patients we identified unsatisfied  condition of MG with lower FVC, previous long-term corticosteroid treatment  especially in higher doses, older age, the presence of cancer, and recent  rituximab treatment.

AB  - The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, is spreading around the world and causing many deaths, mainly from  pneumonia. Currently, there are no specific drugs to treat COVID-19, and existing  antiviral drugs are being used as an alternative. One of these is favipiravir, a  new type of influenza drug. However, its efficacy, dosage, and duration of  administration are still under study. In this case study, we administered  favipiravir to patients with COVID-19 and determined the viral load of severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the COVID-19 pathogen,  using semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR in sputum samples. We  report on two patients in whom the viral load increased again after completion of  10 days of favipiravir treatment and a transient relapse of symptoms was  observed.

AB  - Characteristics and research collaboration of registered systematic reviews (SRs) on treatment modalities for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) remain unclear.  This study analysed research collaboration, interventions and outcome measures in  registered SRs on COVID-19 treatments and pointed out the relevant problems.  PROSPERO (international prospective register of systematic reviews) was searched  for SRs on COVID-19 treatments as of 2 June 2020. Excel 2016 was used for  descriptive analyses of the extracted data. VOSviewer 1.6.14 software was used to  generate network maps for collaborations between countries and institutions. A  total of 189 SRs were included, which were registered by 301 institutions from 39  countries. China (69, 36.50%) exhibited the highest output. Cooperation between  countries was not close enough. As an institution, the Chengdu University of  Traditional Chinese Medicine (7, 3.70%) had the highest output. There was close  cooperation between institutions. Interventions included antiviral therapy (81,  42.86%), respiratory support (16, 8.47%), circulatory support (11, 5.82%), plasma  therapy for convalescent patients (11, 5.82%), immunotherapy (9, 4.76%), TCM  (traditional Chinese medicine) treatment (9, 4.76%), rehabilitation treatment (5,  2.65%), anti-inflammatory treatment (16, 8.47%) and other treatments (31,  16.40%). Concerning antiviral therapy (81, 42.86%), the most commonly used  antiviral agents were chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (26, 13.76%), followed by  remdesivir (12, 6.35%), lobinavir/ritonavir (11, 5.82%), favipiravir (5, 2.65%),  ribavirin (5, 2.65%), interferon (5, 2.65%), abiron (4, 2.12%) and abidor (4,  2.12%). The most frequently used primary and secondary outcomes were the  mortality rate (92, 48.68%) and hospital stay length (48, 25.40%), respectively.  The expression of the outcomes was not standardised. Many COVID-19 SRs on  treatment modalities have been registered, with a low completion rate. Although  there was some collaboration between countries and institutions in the currently  registered SRs on treatment modalities for COVID-19 on PROSPERO, cooperation  between countries should be further enhanced. More attention should be directed  towards identifying deficiencies of outcome measures, and the standardisation of  results should be maximised.

AB  - The ongoing Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emphasized the urgent need  for antiviral therapeutics. The viral RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) is a  promising target with polymerase inhibitors successfully used for the treatment  of several viral diseases. We demonstrate here that Favipiravir predominantly  exerts an antiviral effect through lethal mutagenesis. The SARS-CoV RdRp complex  is at least 10-fold more active than any other viral RdRp known. It possesses  both unusually high nucleotide incorporation rates and high-error rates allowing  facile insertion of Favipiravir into viral RNA, provoking C-to-U and G-to-A  transitions in the already low cytosine content SARS-CoV-2 genome. The  coronavirus RdRp complex represents an Achilles heel for SARS-CoV, supporting  nucleoside analogues as promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Favipiravir is a repurposed drug to treat coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Due to a lack of available real-world data, we assessed its  effectiveness and safety in moderately to critically ill COVID-19 patients.  METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in two public/specialty hospitals  in Saudi Arabia. We included patients ≥18 years) admitted April-August 2020 with  confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  from nasopharyngeal swab. Patients received either favipiravir (1800 mg or  1600 mg twice daily loading dose, followed by 800 mg or 600 mg twice daily) or  supportive-care treatment. Patients were excluded if they were outside the study  period, classified as having a mild form of the disease per WHO criteria, or had  an incomplete patient file. Kaplan-Meier (KM) models were used to estimate median  time to discharge. Discharge ratios, progression to mechanical ventilation, and  mortality outcomes were estimated across the severity spectrum using Cox  proportional-hazards models. As a sensitivity analysis, we performed propensity  score-matching (PSM) analysis. RESULTS: Overall, median time to discharge was  10 days (95%CI = 9-10) in the favipiravir arm versus 15 days (95%CI = 14-16) in  the supportive-care arm. The accelerated discharge benefit was seen across the  COVID-19 spectrum of severity. The adjusted discharge ratio was 1.96 (95%CI =  1.56-2.46). Progression to mechanical ventilation was slower with favipiravir  (HR(adj) = 0.10, 95%CI = 0.04-0.29). There was no significant effect on mortality  (HR(adj) = 1.56, 95%CI = 0.73-3.36). There was a statistically non-significant  trend toward worse outcomes in the critical category (HR(adj) = 2.80, 95%CI =  0.99-7.89). Age was an independent risk factor for mortality in mechanically  ventilated patients. PSM analyses confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION:  Favipiravir was associated with clinical benefits, including accelerated  discharge rate and less progression to mechanical ventilation; however, no  overall mortality benefits were seen across the severity spectrum.

AB  - Data suggests that favipiravir (FVP) could be used against SARS-CoV-2. Our aim was to investigate the role of FVP in COVID-19 treatment. A prospective  sequential cohort study was performed among adults hospitalized at our center  between March and August 2020 with moderate-to-severe, PCR-confirmed COVID-19.  For diagnosis and severity, ECDC and WHO definitions were utilized. Patients were  screened for inclusion by a priori criteria and included in the FVP cohort if  standard-of-care (SOC) + FVP or the non-FVP cohort if SOC ± other antivirals  without FVP were administered for > 48 h from diagnosis. Treatment allocation was  done per national guidelines, based on severity and drug availability. Primary  endpoint was disease progression, a composite of 14-day all-cause death, need for  mechanical ventilation, or immunomodulatory therapy. The impact of FVP exposure  on disease progression was analyzed by binomial logistic regression. In all, 150  patients were included, 75 in each cohort. Disease progression (17/75, 22.7% vs.  10/75, 13.3%, p = 0.13), 14-day all-cause death (9/75, 12.0% vs. 10/75, 13.3%,  p = 0.8), and need for mechanical ventilation (8/75, 10.7% vs. 4/75, 5.3%,  p = 0.22) were similar, while immunomodulatory therapies were required more  frequently among patients receiving FVP (10/75, 13.3% vs. 1/75, 1.3%, p < 0.01).  The use of favipiravir was not retained as a protective factor against disease  progression in multivatiate analysis. Time to antiviral therapy from PCR  positivity, disease severity, need for oxygen supportation, and ICU admittance  rates did not differ statistically between cohorts. In this study, favipiravir  did not seem to positively affect disease progression.

AB  - Central and peripheral nervous system involvement of COVID-19 has been reported in 25% of cases. COVID-19 is associated with encephalitis and most often  presenting with confusion and disorientation, and mortality decreases with early  diagnosis and treatment.The patient who was admitted with confusion and fever and  found COVID-19 PCR positivity in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the  nasopharyngeal swab is presented here. A 71-year-old female patient who underwent  transsphenoidal pituitary tumor surgery 4 months ago, was in an acute confusional  state with fluctuations in consciousness and agitation. It was suggested that  bilateral temporal areas of the brain and paramedian region of the pons  compatible with encephalitis in the T2 and FLAIR axial sections of magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI). Nasopharyngeal and CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR was studied  since thorax CT was compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia and in both samples, PCR  was found positive. Encephalitis for toxic and metabolic causes was excluded. In  this case, COVID-19 encephalitis was treated with dual antiviral (favipiravir and  acyclovir) and steroid therapy. The uniqueness of this case is not only the  presence of a very few reported cases of both Nasopharyngeal and CSF SARS-CoV-2  RNA PCR positivity but also previous history of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery  4 months ago.

AB  - World is familiar with the viral pathogen Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). The principle working enzymes of SARS CoV-2 have been  identified as main proteases 3Cl pro which act as main regulators for SARS  infection. The need for therapy is required immediately pertaining to the  vulnerable conditions. Protein-ligand studies are imperative for understanding  the functioning of biological interactions as they are crucial in providing a  hypothetical origin for the design and unearthing of novel drug targets.  Phytoconstituents from Glycyrrhiza glabra, earlier reported to be anticancerous  in nature were used as repurposed drugs against SARS CoV-2 main protease 3Clpro.  We analyzed the molecular interactions of protein-phytocompounds, by AutoDock  Vina 4.2 tools. The best interactions of each algorithm were subjected to  molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to have an insight of the molecular dynamic  mechanisms involved. Selected phytoconstituents gave a good score for binding  affinity with the main protease 6LU7 of SARS CoV-2 as compared to the antiviral  drugs already being used in the disease therapy.  DehydroglyasperinC(-8.7,-8.1,-6.7,-7.1)kcal/mol, Licochalcone  D(-8.4,-8.2,-7.1,-7.9) kcal/mol, Liquiritin(-8.6,-9.0,-7.2,-7.8) kcal/mol have  showed energy interactions with 3Clpro better than many FDA approved repurposed  drugs; Remdesvir, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine. MD Simulation also  corelates our findings for molecular docking studies.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became a pandemic, resulting in an  exponentially increased mortality globally and scientists all over the world are  struggling to find suitable solutions to combat it. Multiple repurposed drugs  have already been in several clinical trials or recently completed. However, none  of them shows any promising effect in combating COVID-19. Therefore, developing  an effective drug is an unmet global need. RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase)  plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Therefore, it is considered as a prime  target of drugs that may treat COVID-19. In this study, we have screened a  library of compounds, containing approved RdRp inhibitor drugs that were or in  use to treat other viruses (favipiravir, sofosbuvir, ribavirin, lopinavir,  tenofovir, ritonavir, galidesivir and remdesivir) and their structural analogues,  in order to identify potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Extensive  screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics show that five structural  analogues have notable inhibitory effects against RdRp of SARS-CoV-2.  Importantly, comparative protein-antagonists interaction revealed that these  compounds fit well in the pocket of RdRp. ADMET analysis of these compounds  suggests their potency as drug candidates. Our identified compounds may serve as  potential therapeutics for COVID-19.

AB  - Here we report on the most recent updates on experimental drugs successfully employed in the treatment of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, also  referred to as COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease-19). In particular, several cases of  recovered patients have been reported after being treated with  lopinavir/ritonavir [which is widely used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus  (HIV) infection] in combination with the anti-flu drug oseltamivir. In addition,  remdesivir, which has been previously administered to Ebola virus patients, has  also proven effective in the U.S. against coronavirus, while antimalarial  chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and co-administered darunavir and  umifenovir (in patient therapies) were also recently recorded as having  anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. Since the recoveries/deaths ratio in the last weeks  significantly increased, especially in China, it is clear that the experimental  antiviral therapy, together with the availability of intensive care unit beds in  hospitals and rigorous government control measures, all play an important role in  dealing with this virus. This also stresses the urgent need for the scientific  community to devote its efforts to the development of other more specific  antiviral strategies.

Especially with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, our  biomedical research infrastructure has never been more compelled to rapidly  develop antiviral regimens that demonstrate improved efficacy against these  pathogens. Here, we showcase 3 poignant antivirals against the lucrative target,  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of RNA viruses - a timely and relevant topic  given the present efforts against COVID-19. While effective drug designs against  RdRP are important, their benefit and potential as a standard of care truly  relies on them standing out in well-designed clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, potential therapeutic agents are being evaluated almost every day. Ciclosporin, a calcineurin inhibitor, is  characterized by beneficial antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. The present  study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ciclosporin in managing COVID-19.  METHODS: This study was a prospective non-controlled clinical trial carried out  on 20 patients. Confirmed COVID-19 patients received two doses of ciclosporin  (10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg injections) 24 h apart. Mortality rate and the lengths of  intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays were assessed for all 20 patients.  RESULTS: The mortality rate and the need for mechanical ventilation were  calculated as 50%. The percentage of ICU admission was 70%. The lengths of ICU  and hospital stays were 8.13 ± 6.81 and 14.25 ± 8.55 days, respectively. The  levels of ferritin and white blood cells were significantly higher after  injecting the second dose of ciclosporin. Seven patients (35%) had radiologically  improved lungs after ciclosporin therapy. CONCLUSION: It seems that the protocol  of two doses of ciclosporin in combination with favipiravir does not have  favorable effects among COVID-19 patients that do not respond to dexamethasone.  Controlled trials are needed to confirm the results.

AB  - In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in patients in Wuhan, China. The virus, subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2,  spread worldwide and the disease (coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19) was  declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Older  adults and individuals with comorbidities have been reported as being more  vulnerable to COVID-19. Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) have  compromised immune function due to cirrhosis and are more susceptible to  infection. However, it is unclear if patients with CLD are more vulnerable to  COVID-19 and its complications than other populations. The high number of severe  cases of COVID-19 has placed an unusual burden on health systems, compromising  their capacity to provide the regular care that patients with CLD require. Hence,  it is incredibly crucial at this juncture to provide a set of interim  recommendations on the management of patients with CLD during the current  COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The global pandemic called COVID-19 has dragged the world into a healthcare crisis, and favipiravir is one of the most prescribed agents against  the virus so far. Favipiravir is a repurposed antiviral agent in treatment of  SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to meet the current need, pharmaceutical companies are  working for manufacturing licensed generic favipiravir. For getting the marketing  authorization, the bioequivalence of the generic product must be proven first.  The aim of this study is to demonstrate the bioequivalence of a new favipiravir  tablet formulation as compared to the reference tablet formulation in healthy  male subjects under fasting conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To prove the  bioequivalence, a randomized, single oral dose, cross-over, two-period study was  carried out in 30 healthy subjects under fasting conditions. Plasma favipiravir  levels were quantified by using an in-house-developed high performance liquid  chromatography with mass spectrometry detector (LC-MSD) method. RESULTS: The 90%  CIs for the test/reference geometric mean ratios of the C(max) and AUC(0-tlast)  were 88.02 - 103.11% and 98.19 - 102.06%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This  single-dose study has shown that the test and reference favipiravir products met  the required bioequivalence criteria. Besides, both products were well tolerated  and safe.

AB  - PURPOSE: Using CT findings from a prospective, randomized, open-label multicenter trial of favipiravir treatment of COVID-19 patients, the purpose of this study  was to compare the utility of machine learning (ML)-based algorithm with that of  CT-determined disease severity score and time from disease onset to CT (i.e.,  time until CT) in this setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March to May 2020, 32  COVID-19 patients underwent initial chest CT before enrollment were evaluated in  this study. Eighteen patients were randomized to start favipiravir on day 1  (early treatment group), and 14 patients on day 6 of study participation (late  treatment group). In this study, percentages of ground-glass opacity (GGO),  reticulation, consolidation, emphysema, honeycomb, and nodular lesion volumes  were calculated as quantitative indexes by means of the software, while  CT-determined disease severity was also visually scored. Next, univariate and  stepwise regression analyses were performed to determine relationships between  quantitative indexes and time until CT. Moreover, patient outcomes determined as  viral clearance in the first 6 days and duration of fever were compared for those  who started therapy within 4, 5, or 6 days as time until CT and those who started  later by means of the Kaplan-Meier method followed by Wilcoxon's signed-rank  test. RESULTS: % GGO and % consolidation showed significant correlations with  time until CT (p < 0.05), and stepwise regression analyses identified both  indexes as significant descriptors for time until CT (p < 0.05). When divided all  patients between time until CT of 4 days and that of more than 4 days, accuracy  of the combined quantitative method (87.5%) was significantly higher than that of  the CT disease severity score (62.5%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: ML-based CT texture  analysis is equally or more useful for predicting time until CT for favipiravir  treatment on COVID-19 patients than CT disease severity score.

AB  - RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) from positive-stranded RNA viruses has always been a hot target for designing of new drugs. Major class of drugs that are  targeted against RdRP are nucleotide analogues. Extensive docking and molecular  dynamics study describing the binding of natural nucleotides (NTPs) and its  analogues leading to significant structural variation in the RdRP has been  presented here. RdRP simulations in its apo, NTP-bound, and analogue-bound form  have been performed. Nucleotide analogues included in this study were,  favipiravir, galidesivir, lamivudine, ribavirin, remdesivir and sofosbuvir. The  conformational flexibility of the RdRP molecule has been explored using principal  component (PCA) and Markov state modeling (MSM) analysis. PCA inferred the  presence of correlated motions among the conserved motifs of RdRP. Inter-domain  distances between the finger and thumb subdomain flanking the nascent RNA  template entry site sampled open and closed conformations. The ligand and  template binding motifs F and G showed negatively correlated motions. K551, R553,  and R555, a part of motif F appear to form strong interactions with the ligand  molecules. R836, a primer binding residue was observed to strongly bind to the  analogues. MSM analysis helped to extract statistically distinct conformations  explored by the RdRP. Ensemble docking of the ligands on the Markov states also  suggested the involvement of the above residues in ligand interactions. Markov  states obtained clearly demarcated the open/closed conformations of the template  entry site. These observations on residues from the conserved motifs involved in  binding to the ligands may provide an insight into designing new  inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - A novel, fast and sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the bioanalysis of the antiviral agent favipiravir (FAV); a promising candidate for  treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in human plasma using pyrazinamide as an  internal standard (IS). Simple protein precipitation was adopted for plasma  sample preparation using methanol. Chromatographic separation was accomplished on  Eclipse plus C(18) column (50 × 4.6 mm, 3.5 μm) using a mobile phase composed of  methanol-0.2 % acetic acid (20:80, v/v) pumped at a flow rate 0.6 mL/min in an  isocratic elution mode. The API4500 triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer  was operated with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) in negative electrospray  ionization interface for FAV and positive for IS. The MRM function was used for  quantification, with the transitions set at m/z 156.00→ 113.00 and m/z 124.80→  81.00 for FAV and IS. The method was optimized and fully validated in accordance  to US-FDA guidelines. Linearity was acquired over a concentration range of  100.0-20000.0 ng/mL by computing using weighted linear regression strategy  (1/x(2)). The proposed method was effectively applied for the pharmacokinetic  evaluation of FAV and to demonstrate the bioequivalence of a new FAV formulation  (test) and reference product in healthy Egyptian human volunteers.

AB  - A potent therapy for the infectious coronavirus disease COVID-19 is urgently required with, at the time of writing, research in this area still ongoing. This  study aims to evaluate the in vitro anti-viral activities of combinations of  certain commercially available drugs that have recently formed part of COVID-19  therapy. Dual combinatory drugs, namely; Lopinavir-Ritonavir  (LOPIRITO)-Clarithromycin (CLA), LOPIRITO-Azithromycin (AZI),  LOPIRITO-Doxycycline (DOXY), Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)-AZI, HCQ-DOXY, Favipiravir  (FAVI)-AZI, HCQ-FAVI, and HCQ-LOPIRITO, were prepared. These drugs were mixed at  specific ratios and evaluated for their safe use based on the cytotoxicity  concentration (CC50) values of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. The  anti-viral efficacy of these combinations in relation to Vero cells infected with  SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated from a patient in Universitas Airlangga hospital,  Surabaya, Indonesia and evaluated for IC50 24, 48, and 72 hours after viral  inoculation was subsequently determined. Observation of the viral load in qRT-PCR  was undertaken, the results of which indicated the absence of high levels of  cytotoxicity in any samples and that dual combinatory drugs produced lower  cytotoxicity than single drugs. In addition, these combinations demonstrated  considerable effectiveness in reducing the copy number of the virus at 48 and 72  hours, while even at 24 hours, post-drug incubation resulted in low IC50 values.  Most combination drugs reduced pro-inflammatory markers, i.e. IL-6 and TNF-α,  while increasing the anti-inflammatory response of IL-10. According to these  results, the descending order of effective dual combinatory drugs is one of  LOPIRITO-AZI>LOPIRITO-DOXY>HCQ-AZI>HCQ-FAVI>LOPIRITO-CLA>HCQ-DOX. It can be  suggested that dual combinatory drugs, e.g. LOPIRITO-AZI, can potentially be used  in the treatment of COVID-19 infectious diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our study aims at comparing the efficacy and safety of IFN-based therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon β-1b) vs. favipiravir  (FPV) in a cohort of hospitalized patients with non-critical COVID-19. METHODS:  Single center observational study comparing IFN-based therapy (interferon β-1b,  ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir) vs. FPV in non-critical hospitalized COVID-19  patients. Allocation to either treatment group was non-random but based on  changes to national treatment protocols rather than physicians' selection  (quasi-experimental). We examined the association between IFN-based therapy and  28-day mortality using Cox regression model with treatment as a time-dependent  covariate. RESULTS: The study cohort included 222 patients, of whom 68 (28%)  received IFN-based therapy. Antiviral therapy was started at a median of 5 days  (3-6 days) from symptoms onset in the IFN group vs. 6 days (4-7 days) for the FPV  group, P <0.0001. IFN-based therapy was associated with a lower 28-day mortality  as compared to FPV (6 (9%) vs. 18 (12%)), adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] (95% Cl) =  0.27 (0.08-0.88)). No difference in hospitalization duration between the 2  groups, 9 (7-14) days vs. 9 (7-13) days, P = 0.732 was found. IFN treated group  required less use of systemic corticosteroids (57%) as compared to FPV (77%), P =  0.005 after adjusting for disease severity and other confounders. Patients in the  IFN treated group were more likely to have nausea and diarrhea as compared to FPV  group (13%) vs. (3%), P = 0.013 and (18%) vs. (3%), P<0.0001, respectively.  CONCLUSION: Early IFN-based triple therapy was associated with lower 28-days  mortality as compared to FPV.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is still in a global pandemic that has affected more than 200 countries. When prevention and control  of COVID-19 is gradually normalized, communication between countries needs to be  gradually restored due to development needs. There are 34 vaccines in the  clinical evaluation stage and 145 vaccines in the preclinical evaluation stage in  the global COVID-19 vaccine research and development program, but the rate and  process of vaccination may not be sufficient to meet the current needs of society  for restoring development and communication. Studies have found that chloroquine,  favipiravir, remdesivir and other drugs are useful for COVID-19, but currently  there is no specific drug for the treatment of COVID-19. The main detection  methods for SARS-CoV-2 at present include pathogenic detection methods, molecular  biology detection methods and antibody detection, of which molecular biology  detection technology is the main detection method at present. There are some more  convenient and rapid detection methods. A study showed that salivary nucleic acid  testing could be used for large-scale screening of asymptomatic patients with  SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the results showed that the probability of true  concordance between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva was stubbornly 0.998 (90% CI:  0.996-0.999). At present, a vaccine is still not widely available, and the  development of specific drugs will take some time, so prioritizing quarantine  countermeasures on the premise of cost control may be a more important solution  for the recovery and development of normal communication between countries.

AB  - The repurposing of FDA approved drugs is presently receiving attention for COVID-19 drug discovery. Previous studies revealed the binding potential of  several FDA-approved drugs towards specific targets of SARS-CoV-2; however,  limited studies are focused on the structural and molecular basis of interaction  of these drugs towards multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2. The present study aimed to  predict the binding potential of six FDA drugs towards fifteen protein targets of  SARS-CoV-2 and propose the structural and molecular basis of the interaction by  molecular docking and dynamic simulation. Based on the literature survey, fifteen  potential targets of SARS-CoV-2, and six FDA drugs (Chloroquine,  Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, and Ritonavir) were  selected. The binding potential of individual drug towards the selected targets  was predicted by molecular docking in comparison with the binding of the same  drugs with their usual targets. The stabilities of the best-docked conformations  were confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation and energy calculations. Among the  selected drugs, Ritonavir and Lopinavir showed better binding towards the  prioritized targets with minimum binding energy (kcal/mol), cluster-RMS, number  of interacting residues, and stabilizing forces when compared with the binding of  Chloroquine, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine, later drugs demonstrated better  binding when compared to the binding with their usual targets. Remdesvir showed  better binding to the prioritized targets in comparison with the binding of  Chloroquine, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine, but showed lesser binding  potential when compared to the interaction between Ritonavir and Lopinavir and  the prioritized targets. The structural and molecular basis of interactions  suggest that the FDA drugs can be repurposed towards multiple targets of  SARS-CoV-2, and the present computational models provide insights on the scope of  repurposed drugs against COVID-19.

AB  - Most of drugs could have certain mucocutaneous reactions and COVID-19 drugs are not an exception that we focused. We systematically reviewed databases until  August 15, 2020 and among initial 851 articles, 30 articles entered this study  (20 case reports, 4 cohorts, and 6 controlled clinical trials). The types of  reactions included AGEP, morbiliform drug eruptions, vasculitis, DRESS syndrome,  urticarial vasculitis, and so on. The treatments have been used before side  effects occur, included: antimalarial, anti-viral, antibiotics, tocilizumab,  enoxaparin and and so on. In pandemic, we found 0.004% to 4.15% of definite  drug-induced mucocutaneous reactions. The interval between drug usage and the  eruption varied about few hours to 1 month; tightly dependent to the type of drug  and hydroxychloroqine seems to be the drug with highest mean interval.  Antivirals, antimalarials, azithromycin, and tocilizumab are most responsive  drugs for adverse drug reactions, but antivirals especially in combination with  antimalarial drugs are in the first step. Types of skin reactions are usually  morbilliform/exanthematous maculopapular rashes or urticarial eruptions, which  mostly may manage by steroids during few days. In the setting of HCQ, specific  reactions like AGEP should be considered. Lopinavir/ritonavir is the most  prevalent used drug among antivirals with the highest skin adverse reaction;  ribarivin and remdisivir also could induce cutaneous drug reactions but  favipiravir has no or less adverse effects. Logically the rate of dermatologic  adverse effects among anivirals may relate to their frequency of usage. Rarely,  potentially life-threatening reactions may occur. Better management strategies  could achieve by knowing more about drug-induced mucocutaneous presentations of  COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of favipiravir combined with inhaled interferon beta-1b in adult patients hospitalized with moderate to severe  COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A randomized, open-label controlled trial of oral  favipiravir in adults hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia  from June 22nd 2020 to August 13th 2020 was conducted. Patients were randomly  assigned to receive either a combination of favipiravir with interferon beta-1b  by inhalation aerosol or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The outcome endpoints included  improvement in inflammatory markers, lower length of hospital stay (LOS),  discharges and lower overall 14-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients  underwent randomization with 49% (n = 44) assigned to favipiravir and 51% (n =  45) assigned HCQ. The overall mean age was 55 ± 14 years and 58% (n = 52) were  males. There were no significant differences in the inflammatory biomarkers at  hospital discharge between the two groups; C-reactive protein (p = 0.413),  ferritin (p = 0.968), lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.259) and interleukin 6 (p =  0.410). There were also no significant differences between the two groups with  regards to the overall LOS (7 vs 7 days; p = 0.948), transfers to the ICU (18.2%  vs 17.8%; p = 0.960), discharges (65.9% vs 68.9%; p = 0.764) and overall  mortality (11.4% vs 13.3%; p = 0.778). CONCLUSIONS: No differences in clinical  outcomes were found between favipiravir plus inhaled interferon beta-1b and  hydroxychloroquine in adults hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19  pneumonia.

AB  - We theoretically investigated the adsorption of two common anti-COVID drugs, favipiravir and chloroquine, on fluorinated C(60) fullerene, decorated with metal  ions Cr(3+), Fe(2+), Fe(3+), Ni(2+). We focused on the effect of fluoridation on  the interaction of fullerene with metal ions and drugs in an aqueous solution. We  considered three model systems, C(60), C(60)F(2) and C(60)F(48), and represented  pristine, low-fluorinated and high-fluorinated fullerenes, respectively.  Adsorption energies, deformation of fullerene and drug molecules, frontier  molecular orbitals and vibrational spectra were investigated in detail. We found  that different drugs and different ions interacted differently with fluorinated  fullerenes. Cr(3+) and Fe(2+) ions lead to the defluorination of low-fluorinated  fullerenes. Favipiravir also leads to their defluorination with the formation of  HF molecules. Therefore, fluorinated fullerenes are not suitable for the delivery  of favipiravir and similar drugs molecules. In contrast, we found that fluorine  enhances the adsorption of Ni(2+) and Fe(3+) ions on fullerene and their activity  to chloroquine. Ni(2+)-decorated fluorinated fullerenes were found to be stable  and suitable carriers for the loading of chloroquine. Clear shifts of infrared,  ultraviolet and visible spectra can provide control over the loading of  chloroquine on Ni(2+)-doped fluorinated fullerenes.

AB  - Understanding the effects of metabolism on the rational design of novel and more effective drugs is still a considerable challenge. To the best of our knowledge,  there are no entirely computational strategies that make it possible to predict  these effects. From this perspective, the development of such methodologies could  contribute to significantly reduce the side effects of medicines, leading to the  emergence of more effective and safer drugs. Thereby, in this study, our strategy  is based on simulating the electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS)  fragmentation of the drug molecules and combined with molecular docking and ADMET  models in two different situations. In the first model, the drug is docked  without considering the possible metabolic effects. In the second model, each of  the intermediates from the EI-MS results is docked, and metabolism occurs before  the drug accesses the biological target. As a proof of concept, in this work, we  investigate the main antiviral drugs used in clinical research to treat COVID-19.  As a result, our strategy made it possible to assess the biological activity and  toxicity of all potential by-products. We believed that our findings provide new  chemical insights that can benefit the rational development of novel drugs in the  future.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We will evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir and interferon beta-1a compared to lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta-1a in  patients with confirmed COVID-19, who are moderately ill. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a  phase 3, single-center, randomized, open-label, controlled trial with a  parallel-group design carried out at Shahid Mohammadi Hospital, Bandar Abbas,  Iran. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with age ≥ 20 years admitted at the Severe Acute  Respiratory Syndrome Departments of the Shahid Mohammadi Hospital, Bandar Abbas,  Iran, will be screened for the following criteria. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1.  Confirmed diagnosis of infection with SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction  and/or antibody tests. 2. Moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (via computed tomography  and/or X-ray imaging), requiring hospitalization. 3. Hospitalized ≤ 48 h. 4.  Signing informed consent and willingness of the participant to accept  randomization to any assigned treatment arm. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Underlying  conditions, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, cholestatic liver diseases,  cholecystitis, peptic ulcers, acute and chronic renal failure, and peptic ulcers.  2. Severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia. 3. History of allergy to favipiravir,  lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta-1a. 4. Pregnancy and breastfeeding.  INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention group: favipiravir (Zhejiang Hisun,  China) with interferon beta-1a (CinnaGen, Iran). This group will receive 1600 mg  favipiravir twice a day for the first day and 600 mg twice a day for the  following 4 days with five doses of 44 mcg interferon beta-1a every other day.  CONTROL GROUP: lopinavir/ritonavir (Heterd Company, India) with interferon  beta-1a (CinnaGen, Iran). This group will receive 200/50 mg lopinavir/ritonavir  twice a day for 7 days with five doses of 44 mcg interferon beta-1a every other  day. Other supportive and routine care will be the same in both groups. MAIN  OUTCOMES: The primary outcome of the trial is the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in the  nasopharyngeal samples assessed by RT-PCR after 7 days of randomization as well  as clinical improvement of fever and O(2) saturation within 7 days of  randomization. The secondary outcomes are the length of hospital stay and the  incidence of serious adverse drug reactions within 7 days of randomization.  RANDOMIZATION: Eligible patients will be allocated to one of the study arms using  block randomization in a 1:1 ratio (each block consists of 10 patients). A  web-based system will be used to generate random numbers for the allocation  sequence. Each number relates to one of the study arms.

AB  - Antiviral drugs have been used to treat the ever-growing number of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Consequently, unprecedented amounts of such  drug residues discharging into ambient waters raise concerns on the potential  ecotoxicological effects to aquatic lives, as well as development of antiviral  drug-resistance in wildlife. Here, we estimated the occurrence, fate and  ecotoxicological risk of 11 therapeutic agents suggested as drugs for COVID-19  treatment and their 13 metabolites in wastewater and environmental waters, based  on drug consumption, physical-chemical property, and ecotoxicological and  pharmacological data for the drugs, with the aid of quantitative  structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling. Our results suggest that the  removal efficiencies at conventional wastewater treatment plants will remain low  (<20%) for half of the substances, and consequently, high drug residues (e.g.  7402 ng/L ribavirin, 4231 ng/L favipiravir, 730 ng/L lopinavir, 319 ng/L  remdesivir; each combined for both unchanged forms and metabolites; and when each  drug is administered to 100 patients out of 100,000 populations on a day) can be  present in secondary effluents and persist in the environmental waters.  Ecotoxicological risk in receiving river waters can be high (risk quotient >1) by  a use of favipiravir, lopinavir, umifenovir and ritonavir, and medium (risk  quotient >0.1) by a use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and  ribavirin, while the risk will remain low (risk quotient <0.1) for dexamethasone  and oseltamivir. The potential of wild animals acquiring antiviral drug  resistance was estimated to be low. Our prediction suggests a pressing need for  proper usage and waste management of antiviral drugs as well as for improving  removal efficiencies of drug residues in wastewater.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in antiviral immunity. Genetic defects in interferon receptors, IFNs, and auto-antibodies against IFNs can lead  to the development of life-threatening forms of infectious diseases like a severe  form of COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old boy with a previously reported  homozygous loss-of-function mutation in interferon alpha/beta receptor subunit 1  (IFNAR1) (c.674-2A > G) was diagnosed with severe COVID-19. He had cold symptoms  and a high-grade fever at the time of admission. He was admitted to the pediatric  intensive care unit after showing no response to favipiravir and being hypoxemic.  High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning revealed lung involvement of  70% with extensive areas of consolidation in both lungs. Antibiotics, interferon  gamma (IFN-γ), remdesivir, methylprednisolone pulse, and other medications were  started in the patient. However, remdesivir and methylprednisolone pulse were  discontinued because of their adverse side effects in the patient. His general  condition improved, and a few days later was discharged from the hospital.  CONCLUSION: We reported a patient with severe COVID-19 who had a mutation in  IFNAR1. Our finding suggests that patients with IFNAR1 deficiency are prone to  severe forms of COVID-19. Besides, IFN-γ therapy may be a potential drug to treat  patients with defects in IFN-α/β signaling pathways which needs further  investigations.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVES: In November 2019, several patients were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan,  China. So far, there are no specific treatments with proven high efficacy in  patients with SARS-CoV-2. Presently, several drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine,  ribavirin, favipiravir (FVP), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), remdesivir and  oseltamivir, have been suggested as effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2. The aim  of this study was to describe the clinical experience with FPV and LPV/r in  critically ill patients with COVID-19 at Sakarya University Education and  Research Hospital. METHODS: The study included 107 consecutive patients who had a  laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and were admitted to the intensive care unit  (ICU) between 19 March and 19 May 2020. Follow-up continued through 30 May 2020  when the last observed patients were discharged. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of the  107 patients, 65 received FPV (Group FPV) and 42 received LPV/r (Group LPV/r).  The two groups were similar in terms of demographic data and clinical findings.  43 (66.2%) of the 65 patients in the FPV group and 23 (54.8%) of the 42 patients  in the LPV/r group died (p = 0.237). The median ICU stay was 6.6 (IQR, 3-10) days  in the FPV group and 9 (IQR, 6-16) days in the LPV/r group, which was a  statistically significant difference (p = 0.010). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The  length of hospital stay was significantly lower in the FVP group compared to the  LPV/r group among patients who were discharged from the ICU. Although the  analysis was done with a limited number of patients and the observed difference  in mortality rate is of some concern, FVP treatment may be more beneficial than  LPV/r in terms of effective use in the ICU.

AB  - Although several studies have reported on the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 (SARS-CoV-2), clinical course of the most severe cases requiring treatment in  ICU have been insufficiently reported. A 73-year-old man traveling on a cruise  ship with history of hypertension and dyslipidemia developed high fever, dyspnea  and cough after 7 days of steroid treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing  loss, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in sputa polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  examination. His respiratory function deteriorated despite treatments with  lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, azithromycin and meropenem at a regional  hospital. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU in the tertiary university  hospital on day 10 (ICU day 1). Interferon beta-1b subcutaneous injection was  initiated immediately to enhance anti-viral therapy, and favipiravir on ICU day  10 upon availability. Progression of organ dysfunctions necessitated inhalation  of nitrogen oxide for respiratory dysfunction, noradrenaline for cardiovascular  dysfunction and continuous renal replacement therapy for renal dysfunction. His  blood samples PCR also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, indicating viremia,  concomitantly with elevated IL-6 levels. VV-ECMO was initiated after sudden  exacerbation of respiratory dysfunction on ICU day 7 to maintain oxygenation. The  sustained excessive inflammatory cytokines in the present case might have led to  the exacerbation of the disease, requiring vigorous organ support therapies to  allow for survival and recovery from the rapid progression of multiple organ  dysfunctions and severe respiratory failure.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to use Ligand-based pharmacophore modelling approach for four established antiviral drugs, namely remdesivir, lopinavir,  ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 inhibitors as training sets. In  this study Twenty vanillin derivatives together with monolaurin and tetrodotoxin  were used as test sets to evaluate as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The  Structure-based pharmacophore modelling approach was also performed using 5RE6,  5REX and 5RFZ in order to analyse the binding site and ligand-protein complex  interactions. RESULTS: The pharmacophore modelling mode of 5RE6 displayed two  Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA) and one Hydrophobic (HY) interaction. Besides, the  pharmacophore model of 5REX showed two HBA and two HY interactions. Finally, the  pharmacophore model of 5RFZ showed three HBA and one HY interaction. Based on  ligand-based approach, 20 Schiff-based vanillin derivatives, showed strong M(Pro)  inhibition activity. This was due to their good alignment and common features to  PDB-5RE6. Similarly, monolaurin and tetrodotoxin displayed some significant  activity against SARS-CoV-2. From structure-based approach, vanillin derivatives  (1) to (12) displayed some potent M(Pro) inhibition against SARS-CoV-2.  Favipiravir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also showed some significant  M(Pro) inhibition.

AB  - Favipiravir, a promising antiviral agent, is undergoing clinical trials for the potential treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is the  first report for the electrochemical activity of favipiravir and its  electroanalytical sensing. For this purpose, the effect of cationic surfactant,  CTAB was demonstrated on the enhanced accumulation of favipiravir at the surface  of cathodically pretreated boron-doped diamond (CPT-BDD) electrode. At first, the  electrochemical properties of favipiravir were investigated in the  surfactant-free solutions by the means of cyclic voltammetry. The compound  presented a single oxidation step which is irreversible and adsorption  controlled. A systematic study of various operational conditions, such as  electrode pretreatment, pH of the supporting electrolyte, concentration of CTAB,  accumulation variables, and instrumental parameters on the adsorptive stripping  response, was examined using square-wave voltammetry. An oxidation signal at  around +1.21 V in Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 8.0 containing 6 × 10(-4) M CTAB  allowed to the adsorptive stripping voltammetric determination of favipiravir  (after 60 s accumulation step at open-circuit condition). The process could be  used in the concentration range with two linear segments of 0.01-0.1 μg mL(-1)  (6.4 × 10(-8)-6.4 × 10(-7) M) and 0.1-20.0 μg mL(-1)  (6.4 × 10(-7)-1.3 × 10(-4) M). The limit of detection values were found to be  0.0028 μg mL(-1) (1.8 × 10(-8) M), and 0.023 μg mL(-1) (1.5 × 10(-7) M) for the  first and second segments of calibration graph, respectively. The feasibility of  developed methodology was tested to the analysis of the commercial tablet  formulations and model human urine samples.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The first case of coronavirus infection in the Moravian-Silesian Region was diagnosed on March 12, 2020. The study aimed to describe the first  wave and clinical manifestation of the coronavirus epidemic at the Department of  Infectious Diseases in Ostrava. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample comprised a  total of 195 patients requiring hospitalization at the Department of Infectious  Diseases in Ostrava between March 1 and August 31, 2020. The virus was diagnosed  using polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swabs in 192 patients and  from the bronchoalveolar lavage in one patient. In the other two patients,  serological tests were applied using virus neutralization assays and ELISA  specific antibodies. RESULTS: The sample included 100 men and 95 women. The mean  age was 69.5 years. The most common diagnosis was pneumonia, observed in 123  patients (63 %). Respiratory symptoms without pneumonia were seen in 37 patients  (19 %); loss of smell and taste in 14 patients (7 %); cardiovascular  complications in 9 patients (5 %); acute psychosis in 2 patients (1 %); and  diarrhea and vomiting in 25 patients (13 %). The remaining 23 patients (12 %) did  not present any symptoms. The mean length of hospital stay was 11 days. The most  frequent comorbidity was cardiovascular disease (70 %). A total of 39 patients  died (20 %); their mean age was 77 years. Mechanical ventilation was started in  16 patients, of whom 7 died (43 %). The treatment was mostly symptomatic.  Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 21 patients (11 %), favipiravir to 26  patients (13 %) and remdesivir to 13 patients (6 %). CONCLUSION: Respiratory  complications predominated in the majority of patients with coronavirus  infection. In most cases, the treatment was symptomatic. One-fifth of the  patients, mostly elderly ones, died.

AB  - Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. It is currently used as a possible treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  Pre-clinical or clinical trials of favipiravir require robust, sensitive, and  accurate bioanalytical methods for quantitation of favipiravir levels. Recently,  several studies have been reported about developing a validated liquid  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for measuring  favipiravir levels. However, these methods were validated predominantly for  plasma samples, electrospray ionization was operated only in negative or positive  mode, and clinical application of these methods has not been applied for patients  with COVID-19. This study aimed was to develop a validated LC-MS/MS method for  the measurement of favipiravir levels in positive and negative electrospray  ionization mode and to perform a pilot study in patients with COVID-19 receiving  favipiravir to demonstrate the applicability of this method in biological  samples. Simple protein precipitation was used for the extraction of favipiravir  from the desired matrix. Favipiravir levels were quantitated using MS / MS with  an electrospray ionization source in positive and negative multiple reaction  monitoring (MRM) mode. The chromatographic detection was performed on a  reverse-phase Phenomenex C18 column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm, 100 Å) with gradient  elution using 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in methanol as  mobile phase. The method was linear over the concentration ranges of  0.048-50 µg/mL (in negative ionization mode) and 0.062-50 µg/mL (in positive  ionization mode) with a correlation coefficient (r(2)) better than 0.998. The  total run time was 3.5 min. The intra-assay and inter-assay %CV values were less  than 7.2% and 8.0%, respectively. A simple, rapid and robust LC-MS / MS method  was developed for the measurement of favipiravir and validation studies were  performed. The validated method was successfully applied for drug level  measurement in COVID-19 patients receiving favipiravir.

AB  - Favipiravir is an antiviral drug that is expected to have a therapeutic effect on SARS-CoV2 infection. Teratogenicity and hyperuricemia are known as the main side  effects of favipiravir, but little is known about other side effects. This report  describes a case of cholestatic liver injury induced by favipiravir. A  73-year-old Japanese with a history of alcoholic hepatitis was infected with  SARS-CoV2. Drug therapy was instituted with lopinavir/ritonavir combined with  interferon β-1b. However, his condition worsened despite additional support with  continuous hemodiafiltration and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.  We suspected complications of bacterial pneumonia and started favipiravir in  addition to antimicrobial therapy. Favipiravir was administered at 6000 mg/day on  the first day and 2400 mg/day for the second and subsequent days for 14 days.  After the initiation of antibiotics, transaminase and total bilirubin were  elevated, suggesting a transient cholestasic liver dysfunction. The liver  dysfunction in this case may have been triggered by antibacterial treatment, and  high dose of favipiravir may have promoted the deterioration of liver function.  Monitoring of liver function is vital and close attention should be paid when  using favipiravir at high doses or in patients with impaired liver function.

AB  - With the global epidemic of the COVID-19 virus, extensive and rapid research on drug therapy is underway around the world. In this regard, one of the most widely  studied drugs is Favipiravir. Our aim in this paper is to conduct comprehensive  research based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) on the potential of  metallofullerenes as suitable drug carriers. The surface interaction of  Favipiravir with organometallic compound resulted by doping of the five  transition metals of the first row of the periodic table (Ti, Cr, Cr, Fe, Ni, and  Zn) was examined in depth to select the most suitable metallofullerenes. First,  the adsorption geometries of Favipiravir drug onto each metallofullerene were  deeply investigated. It was found that Cr-, Fe-, and Ni-doped fullerenes provide  the excellent adsorbent property with adsorption energies of -148.2, -149.6, and  -146.6 kJ/mol, respectively. The Infrared spectroscopy (IR) study was conducted  to survey the stretching vibration of bonds involving in the systems, specialty  the CO in the drug, CM in the metallofullerene, and MO in the  metallofullerene-drug complex. Finally, the UV-vis analysis showed that the  absorption spectra for the studied systems may be attributed to the transition  from π-π* and/or n-π*.

AB  - We provide the details of the successful management of a patient with active Cushing's disease complicated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.  The patient was a 27-year-old Japanese female healthcare worker who was scheduled  to undergo pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. She had been in close contact  with an undiagnosed patient infected with COVID-19 and then developed COVID-19  pneumonia. Despite a lack of known risk factors associated with severe COVID-19  infection, the patient's dyspnea worsened and her respiratory condition  deteriorated, as indicated by the need for 7 L/min oxygen supply by mask to  maintain her oxygen saturation at >90%. Medical treatment was initiated to  control hypercortisolism by the 'block and replace' regimen using steroidogenesis  inhibitors and hydrocortisone. The COVID-19 pneumonia improved with multi-modal  treatment including antiviral therapy. One month later, after a negative severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result and with  appropriate protection against virus transmission to medical staff in the  operating room and daily medical care nurses, trans-sphenoidal surgery was  performed by our highly experienced pituitary surgeon. One month after the  surgery, the patient's basal ACTH and cortisol levels and urinary free cortisol  were all under the detection limit. Surgical remission was expected. Since  hypercortisolism due to active Cushing's disease may worsen a COVID-19 infection,  multi-disciplinary management that includes appropriate and prompt treatment  strategies is mandatory in such cases.

AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with the novel, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), transplant medicine also had to  face a new, hitherto unknown challenge. To be prepared for any possibility, we  consider it important to summarize the current knowledge regarding COVID-19 of  liver and kidney transplant patients. Very early reports from Spanish and French  registry recorded fatality rates of 18.6% and 13%, respectively, in renal  patients which suggests a moderately worse outcome compared to the general  population. In patients with positive PCR test but not showing clinical signs,  the reduction of immunosuppression is not advised. In the case of  gastrointestinal or respiratory signs with fever, the discontinuation of  mycophenolate or mTOR inhibitors is recommended with decrease of the trough  levels of calcineurin inhibitors to the lowest effective limit. Stop (kidney  transplanted patients) or decrease (liver transplanted patients)  immunosuppression and maintain corticosteroids when pulmonal injury develops and  consider anti-IL1 and anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody use when hyperinflammatory  syndrome is evolving. No proven effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 exists  currently. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir should be avoided because of the severe  drug interaction with calcineurin inhibitors. The efficacy and tolerability of  hidroxychloroquin remains to be also questionable; enroll patients into clinical  trial with remdesivir or favipiravir if available. COVID-19 is characterized by  virus-induced endothelial dysfunction, procoagulant state and  renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system imbalance. Early thromboprofilaxis  combination with low-molecular-weight heparin and low-dose aspirin is strongly  recommended with the maintenance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor  (ACEI) or angiotensin-II-receptor blocker (ARB) therapy when they were prescribed  earlier.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A variety of possible mechanisms can make the nucleic acid test of patients who meet the discharge conditions positive again, including reinfection,  reactivation of the original virus, lack of strict discharge criteria, new  infection, and so on. Different reasons will correspond to different prevention  and control measures. We will enroll patients who are discharged after treatment,  whose nucleic acid test has changed from negative to positive during the  screening visit, regardless of the severity of the symptoms, to investigate the  mechanism, clinical outcome and therapeutic efficacy with Favipiravir patients  with Corona virus Disease 2019. Favipiravir is an anti-viral agent that  selectively and potently inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, it has been  used for treatment of some life-threatening infections such as Ebola virus, Lassa  virus and rabies. Its therapeutic efficacy has been proven in these diseases.  TRIAL DESIGN: This is a multi-center, two arm, open label, parallel group,  randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Eligibility criteria: Inclusion  criteria: 1.Adults 18 to 80 years, male or female.2.After the first diagnosis and  treatment of COVID-19, the nucleic acid test of respiratory specimens such as  sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs, has been negative for two consecutive times  (sampling time interval of at least 24 hours), in accordance with the COVID-19's  diagnosis and treatment Plan (7th Edition), discharged.3.During screening visit  (follow-up after discharge), The nucleic acid test of COVID-19 is positive in any  one of the following samples: sputum, throat swabs, blood, feces or other  specimens. Regardless of whether or not they had symptoms and the severity of  symptoms.4.Volunteer to participate in the research and sign the Informed Consent  Form. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1.Allergic to Favipiravjr;2.Pregnant or lactating  women3.Uncontrolled diseases of the blood and cardiovascular system, liver or  kidney.4.History of mental disorders, drug abuse or dependence;5.Researchers  consider it inappropriate for adults to participate;6.Participating in other  clinical studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: As the experience has increased regarding SARS-CoV-2 in time, treatment trends have changed since the beginning of the pandemic. This study  aimed to compare the outcomes of different treatment modalities for inpatients in  a tertiary pandemic hospital in Antalya, Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Individuals aged 18 years and above who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in PCR  with presenting COVID-related radiological findings, hospitalized for at least 3  days, and completed follow-up between March 15, 2020 and November 30, 2020 were  included in the study. Patients’ data were reviewed retrospectively. Seven  treatment groups based on the single or combined use of hydroxychloroquine,  oseltamivir, favipiravir, and remdesivir were formed and compared in terms of  mortality, survival, length of hospital stay, need for intensive care, and  mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 321 patients were included in the  study. The length of hospital stay, the need for intensive care, and mechanical  ventilation were lower in Group 1 (hydroxychloroquine) and Group 2  (hydroxychloroquine + oseltamivir) compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). No  significant difference was determined in survival between treatment groups.  Analysis of prognostic factors affecting overall survival revealed that the need  for intensive care and mechanical ventilation increased mortality [11.1 times (p  < 0.001) and 6.48 times (p < 0.001), respectively]. CONCLUSION: No significant  difference was determined between different treatment protocols in terms of their  impact on survival. To end the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to  develop highly efficient, rapid-acting, and orally available antiviral drugs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present COVID-19 pandemic has prompted worldwide repurposing of drugs. The aim of the present work was to develop and validate a two-dimensional  isotope-dilution liquid chromatrography tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LC-MS/MS)  method for accurate quantification of remdesivir and its active metabolite  GS-441524, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir and  azithromycin in serum; drugs that have gained attention for repurposing in the  treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Following protein precipitation, samples were  separated with a two-dimensional ultra-high performance liquid chromatography  (2D-UHPLC) setup, consisting of an online solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to  an analytical column. For quantification, stable isotope-labelled analogues were  used as internal standards for all analytes. The method was validated on the  basis of the European Medicines Agency bioanalytical method validation protocol.  RESULTS: Detuning of lopinavir and ritonavir allowed simultaneous quantification  of all analytes with different concentration ranges and sensitivity with a  uniform injection volume of 5 μL. The method provided robust validation results  with inaccuracy and imprecision values of ≤ 9.59 % and ≤ 11.1 % for all quality  controls. CONCLUSION: The presented method is suitable for accurate and  simultaneous quantification of remdesivir, its metabolite GS-441525, chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir and azithromycin in human  serum. The quantitative assay may be an efficient tool for the therapeutic drug  monitoring of these potential drug candidates in COVID-19 patients in order to  increase treatment efficacy and safety.

AB  - COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and is  ongoing pandemic. While a majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection shows  asymptomatic or mild disease, hospitalized patients can develop critical  condition, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. Some cases  deteriorate into sever systemic disease and multiorgan failure. Many patients of  severe COVID-19 show hypercoagulable state and complicate with venous  thromboembolism and atrial thrombosis. We herein reported a case of COVID-19 who  developed cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) co-incidence with pulmonary  thromboembolism (PTE). A 56-year-old Japanese man was presented with fever and  malaise and diagnosed with COVID-19. He was treated with ciclesonide and  azithromycin, but his respiratory condition deteriorated. Thus, systemic  corticosteroids and favipiravir were initiated and these treatments resulted in  afebrile state, improving malaise and respiratory failure. However, he suddenly  developed severe headache and vomiting with increased concentration of D-dimer.  Brain CT and MRI showed typical images of CVT in the left transvers sinus and CT  pulmonary angiography showed PE. Administration of unfractionated heparin  followed by edoxaban treatment reduced the levels of D-dimer and improved his  clinical presentation and thrombosis. Monitoring coagulopathy is important in  COVID-19 patients and in case of venous thromboembolism, including cerebral  venous system, appropriate anticoagulant therapy should be initiated.

AB  - Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is an acute viral zoonotic disease. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging viral disease and it is  caused by "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)". In this  article, a case diagnosed with CCHF and COVID-19 coinfection confirmed by the  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and its management was presented. A  thirtyfive years old female patient admitted to the hospital with the complaint  of fever for one day and common body pain. It was learned that three days before  the onset of her complaints, she removed a tick adhering to the anterior  abdominal wall with no precaution. Her body temperature was 38°C degrees and her  respiratory rate was 22 per minute. The leucocyte count was 3660/mm³ and the  platelet count was 138.000/mm³. It was determined that prothrombin time was 15.4  seconds, international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.35 seconds, and D-dimer level  was 1310 ng/ml. The patient was hospitalized with prediagnosis of CCHF.  Supportive treatment was started. On the second day at the clinical follow-up of  the patient, complaints of sore throat and cough without sputum started. A  combined nasopharyngeal and throat swab sample was taken from the patient because  of the suspicion of COVID-19. COVID-19 PCR test result was reported as positive.  Favipiravir treatment was started. The CCHF-PCR test, which was studied from the  serum sample sent to the Microbiology Reference Laboratories was reported as  positive. From the third day of favipiravir treatment; the patient did not have a  fever and her complaints regressed. On the ninth day of her hospitalization, she  was discharged. In this case; it is important to show that both diseases,  especially in regions where CCHF disease is endemic, can be confused due to the  similarity of the clinical picture with COVID-19 and to know that they can  coexist.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative evaluation of radiographic images has been developed and suggested for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However,  there are limited opportunities to use these image-based diagnostic indices in  clinical practice. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the utility of a novel  visually-based classification of pulmonary findings from computed tomography (CT)  images of COVID-19 patients with the following three patterns defined:  peripheral, multifocal, and diffuse findings of pneumonia. We also evaluated the  prognostic value of this classification to predict the severity of COVID-19.  METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients  hospitalized with COVID-19 between January 1st and September 30(th), 2020, who  presented with suspicious findings on CT lung images at admission (n = 69). We  compared the association between the three predefined patterns (peripheral,  multifocal, and diffuse), admission to the intensive care unit, tracheal  intubation, and death. We tested quantitative CT analysis as an outcome predictor  for COVID-19. Quantitative CT analysis was performed using a semi-automated  method (Thoracic Volume Computer-Assisted Reading software, GE Health care,  United States). Lungs were divided by Hounsfield unit intervals. Compromised lung  (%CL) volume was the sum of poorly and non-aerated volumes (- 500, 100 HU). We  collected patient clinical data, including demographic and clinical variables at  the time of admission. RESULTS: Patients with a diffuse pattern were intubated  more frequently and for a longer duration than patients with a peripheral or  multifocal pattern. The following clinical variables were significantly different  between the diffuse pattern and peripheral and multifocal groups: body  temperature (p = 0.04), lymphocyte count (p = 0.01), neutrophil count (p = 0.02),  c-reactive protein (p < 0.01), lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.01), Krebs von den  Lungen-6 antigen (p < 0.01), D-dimer (p < 0.01), and steroid (p = 0.01) and  favipiravir (p = 0.03) administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our simple visual assessment  of CT images can predict the severity of illness, a resulting decrease in  respiratory function, and the need for supplemental respiratory ventilation among  patients with COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly recognized infectious disease that has spread rapidly. COVID-19 has been associated with a  number of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias. The mechanism of  ventricular arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19 is uncertain. The aim of the  present study was to evaluate the ventricular repolarization by using the Tp-e  interval, QT dispersion, Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio as candidate markers  of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. In  addition, the relationship between the repolarization parameters and the CRP  (C-reactive protein) was investigated. METHODS: 75 newly diagnosed COVID-19  patients, 75 age and sex matched healthy subjects were included in the study  between 20th March 2020 and 10th April 2020. The risk of ventricular arrhythmias  was evaluated by calculating the electrocardiographic Tp-e and QT interval, Tp-e  dispersion, corrected QT(QTc), QT dispersion (QTd), corrected QTd, Tp-e/QT and  Tp-e/QTc ratios. CRP values were also measured in patients with newly diagnosed  COVID-19. RESULTS: Tp-e interval (80.7 ± 4.6 vs. 70.9 ± 4.8; p < .001), Tp-e / QT  ratio (0.21 ± 0.01 vs. 0.19 ± 0.01; p < .001) and Tp-e/QTc ratio (0.19 ± 0.01  vs.0.17 ± 0.01; p < .001) were significantly higher in patients with newly  diagnosed COVID-19 than the control group. There was a significant positive  correlation between Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QTc ratio and CRP in patients with newly  diagnosed COVID-19 (rs = 0.332, p = .005, rs = 0.397, p < .001 consecutively).  During their treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin and  favipiravir, ventricular tachycardia episodes were observed in in two COVID-19  patients during their hospitalization in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Our  study showed for the first time in literature that the Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT  ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio, which are evaluated electrocardiographically in  patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19, were prolonged compared with normal  healthy individuals. A positive correlation was determined between repolarization  parameters and CRP. We believe that pre-treatment evaluation of repolarization  parameters in newly diagnosed COVID-19 would be beneficial for predicting  ventricular arrhythmia risk.

AB  - As of October 2020, there is still no specific drug to treat COVID-19 as it rages worldwide. Favipiravir, indicated for the treatment of new and re-emerging  influenza infections, has been suggested to be effective against SARS-CoV-2,  although this is not yet fully validated. We administered favipiravir to a  64-year-old female patient with COVID-19. Her symptoms resolved quickly after the  start of treatment, with reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load, but she developed a  fever again on day 12. Since the fever was relieved by discontinuation of  favipiravir, and based on positive results with a drug-induced lymphocyte  stimulation test, we diagnosed her with favipiravir-induced drug fever. A  decrease in the serum concentration of favipiravir was observed along with  resolution of the fever. The present case suggests that drug fever should be  considered in the differential diagnosis of relapsing fever episodes in COVID-19  patients receiving favipiravir.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis are vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 infection, with mortality as high as 31 % in  this group. Population demographics in the UAE are dissimilar to many other  countries and data on antibody responses to COVID-19 is also limited. The  objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients who  developed COVID-19, the impact of the screening strategy, and to assess the  antibody response to a subset of dialysis patients. METHODS: We retrospectively  examined the outcomes of COVID19 infection in all our haemodialysis patients, who  were tested regularly for COVID 19, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. In  addition, IgG antibody serology was also performed to assess response to COVID-19  in a subset of patients. RESULTS: 152 (13 %) of 1180 dialysis patients developed  COVID-19 during the study period from 1st of March to the 1st of July 2020. Of  these 81 % were male, average age of 52​ years and 95 % were on in-centre  haemodialysis. Family and community contact was most likely source of infection  in most patients. Fever (49 %) and cough (48 %) were the most common presenting  symptoms, when present. Comorbidities in infected individuals included  hypertension (93 %), diabetes (49 %), ischaemic heart disease (30 %). The  majority (68 %) developed mild disease, whilst 13 % required critical care.  Combinations of drugs including hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir,  ritonavir, camostat, tocilizumab and steroids were used based on local  guidelines. The median time to viral clearance defined by two negative PCR tests  was 15 days [IQR 6-25]. Overall mortality in our cohort was 9.2 %, but ICU  mortality was 65 %. COVID-19 IgG antibody serology was performed in a subset  (n = 87) but 26 % of PCR positive patients (n = 23) did not develop a significant  antibody response. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a lower mortality in this  patient group compared with many published series. Asymptomatic PCR positivity  was present in 40 %. Rapid isolation of positive patients may have contributed to  the relative lack of spread of COVID-19 within our dialysis units. The lack of  antibody response in a few patients is concerning.

AB  - Several drug candidates have been proposed and tested as the latest clinical treatment for coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine,  ritonavir/lopinavir, and favipiravir are under trials for the treatment of this  disease. The hyperpolarization technique has the ability to further provide a  better understanding of the roles of these drugs at the molecular scale and in  different applications in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance/magnetic  resonance imaging. This technique may provide new opportunities in diagnosis and  research of COVID-19. Signal amplification by reversible exchange-based  hyperpolarization studies on large-sized drug candidates were carried out. We  observed hyperpolarized proton signals from whole structures, due to the  unprecedented long-distance polarization transfer by para-hydrogen. We also found  that the optimal magnetic field for the maximum polarization transfer yield was  dependent on the molecular structure. We can expect further research on the  hyperpolarization of other important large molecules, isotope labeling, as well  as polarization transfer on nuclei with a long spin relaxation time. A clinical  perspective of these features on drug molecules can broaden the application of  hyperpolarization techniques for therapeutic studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease with a high rate of progression to critical illness. However, the predictors of mortality in  critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are not yet  well understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors  associated with ICU mortality in our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this  single-centered retrospective study, we enrolled 86 critically ill adult patients  with COVID-19 admitted to ICU of Dokuz Eylül University Hospital (İzmir, Turkey)  between 18 March 2020 and 31 October 2020. Data on demographic information,  preexisting comorbidities, treatments, the laboratory findings at ICU admission,  and clinical outcomes were collected. The chest computerized tomography (CT) of  the patients were evaluated specifically for COVID-19 and CT score was  calculated. Data of the survivors and nonsurvivors were compared with survival  analysis to identify risk factors of mortality in the ICU. RESULTS: The mean age  of the patients was 71.1 ± 14.1 years. The patients were predominantly male. The  most common comorbidity in patients was hypertension. ICU mortality was 62.8%.  Being over 60 years old, CT score > 15, acute physiology and chronic health  evaluation (APACHE) II score ≥ 15, having dementia, treatment without  favipiravir, base excess in blood gas analysis ≤ –2.0, WBC > 10,000/mm3, D-dimer  > 1.6 μg/mL, troponin > 24 ng/L, Na ≥ 145 mmol/L were considered to link with ICU  mortality according to Kaplan–Meier curves (log-rank test, p < 0.05). The APACHE  II score (HR: 1.055, 95% CI: 1.021–1.090) and chest CT score (HR: 2.411, 95%  CI:1.193–4.875) were associated with ICU mortality in the cox proportional-hazard  regression model adjusted for age, dementia, favipiravir treatment and troponin.  Howewer, no difference was found between survivors and nonsurvivors in terms of  intubation timing. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients have a high ICU admission and  mortality rate. Studies in the ICU are also crucial in this respect. In our  study, we investigated the ICU mortality risk factors of COVID-19 patients. We  determined a predictive mortality model consisting of APACHE II score and chest  CT score. It was thought that this feasible and practical model would assist in  making clinical decisions.

AB  - This paper reports the presentation and management of an older female patient who was diagnosed with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and discharged from an  intensive care unit (ICU) after prolonged hospitalization. The patient's COVID-19  test was negative; therefore, she was monitored in the COVID-19 general clinic  with normal levels of oxygen saturation (SpO(2) ). The patient had been taking  Plaquenil for rheumatoid arthritis for a long time. Azithromycin was administered  first, and then, the treatment continued with favipiravir according to the  national treatment protocol in Turkey. On the third day in the COVID-19 general  clinic, she was transferred to the ICU because of decreased saturation levels.  Owing to worsening respiratory status and SpO(2) <70%, the patient was intubated  on the sixth day in the ICU, and every day, she was nursed in a prone position  for >16 hours. We believe that the treatment and care activities under qualified  and effective nursing care, such as providing appropriate respiratory support at  the right time, early initiation and maintenance of anticoagulant therapy,  long-term prone positioning, maintaining sufficient fluid resuscitation, and  early commencement of balanced enteral nutrition, contributed to the successful  discharge of the patient from the ICU. The patient was finally extubated on the  23rd day. Respiratory support was continued with oxygen administered at 2 lt/min  through a nasal canula with SpO(2) at 94%. We believe that by combining all these  factors, the patient's results improved. She was discharged from the ICU after  25 days without any organ dysfunction. During the 25 days of care in the ICU,  infectious disease protection and isolation rules were strictly adhered to, and  personal protective equipment was worn.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical information about  patients undergoing lung resection while infected with this virus and  pathological information about early COVID-19 pneumonia are still scarce. CASE  PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old male patient underwent a right pneumonectomy for  squamous cell lung carcinoma. Until the fourth postoperative day, the patient,  who had minor radiological changes on chest x-ray, was asymptomatic. From this  day, the COVID-19 test, which was performed after the appearance of symptoms such  as fever and shortness of breath, lymphopenia and diffuse ground glass opacity in  the left lung on computed tomography, was reported to be positive. The patient  was given NIMV (non-invasive mechanical ventilation), and hydroxychloroquine,  favipiravir and azithromycin in isolation intensive care, with the diagnosis of  severe pneumonia. He was discharged on the 17th postoperative day with healing of  the lung lesions. The pathology specimen of the patient, who was found to have  been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before the day of surgery, was examined  retrospectively. Irregular and severe pneumocyte hyperplasia, interstitial  thickening, oedema, pronounced protein exudates, diffuse enlargement of the  alveolar walls, macrophage infiltration and fibroblastic proliferation, which is  an indicator of early organisation, were detected. CONCLUSION: We believe that  the clinical course and pathology findings obtained after right pneumonectomy in  a patient with pre-symptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia will guide the diagnosis and  treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Role of different tautomers in the base-pairing abilities of some of the vital antiviral drugs used against COVID-19.
AU  - Jena, N. R.
T2  - Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP
AB  - Repurposed drugs are now considered as attractive therapeutics against COVID-19. It is shown that Remdesivir, a nucleoside drug that was originally invented for  the Ebola virus, is effective in suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 that  causes COVID-19. Similarly, Galidesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin,  N4-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931), and EIDD-2801 (a prodrug of EIDD-1931) were also  found to be effective against COVID-19. However, the mechanisms of action of  these drugs are not yet fully understood. For example, in some experimental  studies, these drugs were proposed to act as a RNA-chain terminator, while in  other studies, these were proposed to induce base-pair mutations above the error  catastrophe limit to stall the replication of the viral RNA. To understand the  mutagenic effects of these drugs, the role of different tautomers in their  base-pairing abilities is studied here in detail by employing a reliable  dispersion-corrected density functional theoretic method. It is found that  Remdesivir and Galidesivir can adopt both amino and imino tautomeric  conformations to base-pair with RNA bases. While the insertions of G and U are  preferred against the amino tautomers of these drugs, the insertion of C is  mainly possible against the imino tautomers. However, although Favipiravir and  Ribavirin can make stable base pair interactions by using their keto and enol  tautomers, the formation of the latter pairs would be less probable due to the  endothermic nature of the products. Interestingly, the insertions of all of the  RNA bases are found to be possible against the keto tautomer of Favipiravir,  while the keto tautomer of Ribavirin has a clear preference for G. Remarkably,  due to the negligible difference in the stability of EIDD-2801 and EIDD-1931,  these tautomers would coexist in the biological environment. The insertion of G  is found to be preferred against EIDD-1931 and the incorporations of U, A, and G  are preferred opposite EIDD-2801. These findings suggest that base-pair mutations  are the main causes of the antiviral properties of these drugs.

However, due to a lack of significant  improvement, he was introduced to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal  membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Although iliopsoas hematoma occurred as a  complication, the patient recovered. Case 2: A 49-year-old man with COVID-19 had  been started on favipiravir and corticosteroid. Due to progressive respiratory  failure, the patient underwent mechanical ventilation and ECMO. The patient  recovered without complications. We successfully treated these severe cases with  a multimodal combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological supportive  therapy.

AB  - We report a case of COVID-19 in kidney transplant patient in Thailand. A 58-year-old 2 years post-kidney transplant recipient, with maintenance  immunosuppression of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisolone,  presented with acute diarrhea which followed by fever on day 12. Symptoms of  pneumonia together with lymphopenia from complete blood count were developed on  day 7 after onset of fever with the x-ray finding of bilateral multifocal patchy  infiltration. COVID-19 infection has been confirmed by reverse real-time  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nasal swab as well as found in stool.  Darunavir together with ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and  favipiravir was initiated on the first day of admission at primary hospital.  Patient has been transferred to our hospital on day 2 of admission in which  tacrolimus together with MMF was discontinued. High-flow nasal cannula oxygen  therapy was required on days 4-5 of hospitalization. Tocilizumab was administered  after rising of serum IL-6 level. Symptoms of pneumonia were improved in which no  oxygen treatment required from day 10 of hospitalization. Drug interaction  between tacrolimus and anti-viral treatment leads to severely high level of  tacrolimus which caused reversible acute kidney injury (AKI) after supportive  treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) refers to infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen, and  has spread to pandemic levels since its inception in December 2019. While several  risk factors for severe presentation have been identified, the clinical course  for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on maintenance hemodialysis with  COVID-19 has been unclear. Previous studies have revealed that some antiviral  agents may be effective against COVID-19 in the general population, but the  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these agents in ESRD patients remain  under investigation. Favipiravir, an antiviral agent developed for treatment of  influenza, is one candidate treatment for COVID-19, but suitable dosages for  patients with renal insufficiency are unknown. Here we provide a first report on  the efficacy of favipiravir in a patient with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis. CASE  PRESENTATION: The case involved a 52-year-old woman with COVID-19 who had been  undergoing maintenance hemodialysis three times a week for 3 years due to  diabetic nephropathy. She had initially been treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and  ciclesonide for 5 days, but developed severe pneumonia requiring invasive  positive-pressure ventilation. Those antiviral agents were subsequently switched  to favipiravir. She recovered gradually, and after 2 weeks was extubated once the  viral load of SARS-CoV-2 fell below the limit of detection. Although  concentrations of several biliary enzymes were elevated, no major adverse events  were observed. CONCLUSION: Favipiravir may be an effective option for the  treatment of COVID-19-infected patients with ESRD.

On the 14th day after the start of favipiravir administration,  the patient developed a fever with a temperature of 38.1°C. His pulse rate also  became elevated to 128 bpm, so relative bradycardia was not suspected. Since he  was in good overall health and no concomitant symptoms and signs were apparent,  we considered it to be drug fever due to favipiravir. After the completion of  favipiravir treatment, the patient's temperature normalized within 24 hours. We  herein report this case of drug fever caused by favipiravir.

AB  - Although the use of corticosteroids is not recommended in the World Health Organization statement for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),  steroid therapy may be indicated for critical cases in specific situations. Here,  we report the successful treatment of 11 cases of severe COVID-19 pneumonia with  favipiravir and methylprednisolone. All cases were severe and patients required  oxygen administration or had a blood oxygen saturation ≤93% on room air. All were  treated with favipiravir and methylprednisolone, and 10 of 11 patients responded  well and required no further oxygen supplementation or ventilator management.  This study shows the importance of the early-stage use of a combination of  favipiravir and methylprednisolone in severe cases to achieve a favorable  clinical outcome.

AB  - The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first seen in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread  worldwide. On 24 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported that  the use of convalescent plasma (CP) containing antibodies against COVID-19 could  be effective against infection. The aim of this study is to retrospectively  investigate whether early CP transfusion treatment has an effect on recovery of  clinical and laboratory parameters in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 who  were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The study included 141  consecutive patients who had laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and were  admitted to the ICU between 1 May and 30 September 2020. Of the 141 patients, 84  received CP in the first five days of hospitalization in the ICU (early group),  and 57 received CP after the fifth day of hospitalization in the ICU (late  group). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of  age, gender, comorbidities and the severity of the disease (according to the  evaluation of lung tomography). There was no difference between the two groups in  terms of mechanical ventilator needed, inotrope support, and tracheostomy  procedure during the ICU admission (p = 0.962, p = 0.680, and p = 0.927,  respectively). Despite these limitations, the overriding result of our study is  that it suggests that administration of CP either early or late in the treatment  of COVID-19, had no effect on mortality.

AB  - The article focuses on effective treatment of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) at early stages and substantiates the requirement for antiviral  therapy and for decreasing the viral load to prevent the infection progression.  The absence of a specific antiviral therapy for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is stated.  The authors analyzed results of early randomized studies using  lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir in COVID-19 and their potential  for the treatment of novel coronavirus infection. Among the drugs blocking the  virus entry into cells, the greatest attention was paid to the antimalaria drugs,  chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The article addresses in detail  ineffectiveness and potential danger of hydroxychloroquine, which demonstrated  neither a decrease in the time of clinical recovery nor any improvement of  prognosis for patients with COVID-19. The major objective was substantiating a  possible use of bromhexine, a mucolytic and anticough drug, which can inhibit  transmembrane serin protease 2 required for entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into  cells. Spironolactone may have a similar feature. Due to its antiandrogenic  effects, spironolactone can inhibit X-chromosome-related synthesis of ACE-2  receptors and activation of transmembrane serin protease 2. In addition to  slowing the virus entry into cells, spironolactone decreases severity of fibrosis  in different organs, including the lungs. The major part of the article addresses  clinical examples of managing patients with COVID-19 at the University Clinic of  the Medical Research and Educational Centre of the M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State  University, including successful treatment with schemes containing bromhexine and  spironolactone. In conclusion, the authors described the design of a randomized,  prospective BISCUIT study performed at the University Clinic of the M. V.  Lomonosov Moscow State University with an objective of evaluating the efficacy of  this scheme.

TI  - Tissue distributions of antiviral drugs affect their capabilities of reducing viral loads in COVID-19 treatment.
AU  - Wang, Yan

T2  - European journal of pharmacology
AB  - Repurposing of approved antiviral drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a promising strategy to treat Coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19) patients. Previously we reported our hypothesis that the  antiviral drugs with high lung distributions might benefit COVID-19 patients by  reducing viral loads. So far, chloroquine, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine,  azithromycin, favipiravir, ribavirin, darunavir, remdesivir, and umifenovir have  been tested in COVID-19 clinical trials. Here we validated our hypothesis by  comparing the pharmacokinetics profiles of these drugs and their capabilities of  reducing viral load in clinical trials. According to bulk RNA and single cell RNA  sequencing analysis, we found that high expression of both angiotensin converting  enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) makes the lung and  intestine vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and  favipiravir, which were highly distributed to the lung, were reported to reduce  viral loads in respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients. Conversely, drugs with  poor lung distributions, including lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir and  remdesivir, were insufficient to inhibit viral replication. Lopinavir/ritonavir  might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the GI tract according to their distribution  profiles. We concluded here that the antiviral drugs should be distributed  straight to the lung tissue for reducing viral loads in respiratory tract of  COVID-19 patients. Additionally, to better evaluate antiviral effects of drugs  that target the intestine, the stool samples should also be collected for viral  RNA test in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Favipiravir is used in treatment of Covid-19 patients. We aimed to share of ocular surface fluorescence in a patient after Favipiravir treatment in  this case report. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old male patient declared no known  systemic disease prior to Covid-19. He applied to us with blurry vision and blue  light reflection after Covid-19 treatment with Favipiravir. We observed bilateral  fluorescence on his eyes and fluorescence of his nails. Biomicroscopic  examination was insignificant. CONCLUSION: We investigated the fluorescence of  favipiravir tablets under ultraviolet light. Drug demonstrated fluorescence. We  recorded the favipiravir fluorescence in-vitro. This appears to be a strong  evidence in terms of the linkage between the fluorescence of the ocular surface  and favipiravir.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection emerged in China at the end of 2019 and caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The  lymphopenia seen in COVID-19 increases the incidence of susceptibility to other  microorganisms and may cause co-infections. As the signs and symptoms of the  diseases overlap with other infectious diseases and due to the intensity in  health services, the diagnosis of co-infections becomes difficult and the  treatment may be delayed. Therefore, infections accompanying COVID-19 cause an  increase in morbidity and mortality.The isolation and quarantine measures taken  during the COVID-19 process have reduced the number of infections transmitted  from person to person. However, there was no significant decrease in diseases  transmitted by food, such as salmonellosis. During the pandemic, salmonellosis  continued to be a problem, especially in endemic areas such as Pakistan, and an  increase in Salmonella infections associated with backyard poultry has been  reported in countries such as the United States. A co-infection of COVID-19 and  enteric fever associated with travel to Pakistan was reported for the first time  in the literature in February 2021. In this case report, the first co-infection  of COVID-19 and Salmonella in our country was presented. A 56-yearold male  patient with no known systemic disease was admitted to the hospital with fever,  shortness of breath, weakness and myalgia lasting for three days. SARS-CoV-2  polymerase chain reaction test was positive. The patient has been hospitalized  and favipiravir, moxifloxacin, and methylprednisolone were started. Blood  cultures were taken from the patient whose clinical picture worsened and fever  continued despite of the medical treatment. Salmonella enterica spp. enterica was  isolated and ceftriaxone treatment was started. The patient's anamnesis was  deepened, but no diarrhea, abdominal pain, suspicious food consumption, travel  history were determined. From the second day of the ceftriaxone treatment, the  patient's fever decreased and no growth was detected in the control blood  cultures. Ceftriaxone treatment was completed in 14 days and the patient was  discharged on the 28th day. Approximately 87-95% of Salmonella strains isolated  in our country are S.enterica spp. enterica, and S.enterica spp. enterica was  also isolated in our case. Salmonella infections most commonly present as  gastroenteritis, but the risk of bacteremia increases in case of  immunosuppression. Although there was no additional disease in our case, it was  considered that the infection in the form of bacteremia occurred due to an  immunosuppression caused by COVID-19. In this context; drawing blood cultures of  patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 is very important in terms  of detecting co-infections and superinfections, and administering appropriate  antibiotic therapy at appropriate treatment times. Presentation of first case of  Salmonella bacteremia and simultaneous COVID-19 infection in our country was the  strong side of our report. In addition, our case is also important as being the  first SARS-CoV-2 and Salmonella co-infection unrelated to Pakistan in the  literature. The limitation of our case was that S.enterica spp. enterica detected  in the blood culture could not be subtyped and the stool culture could not be  examined. However, this does not constitute a diagnostic requirement. In  addition, the patient's pre-COVID-19 Salmonella carrier status was also unknown.  As a result, patients become vulnerable to other infections due to the  lymphopenia seen in COVID-19. Therefore, Salmonella bacteremia can be seen with  SARS-CoV-2 infection without a comorbid condition. Drawing blood cultures in  hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 is very important in terms  of detecting concomitant infections in a short time. In patients whose clinical  condition does not improve and fever continues despite of treatment, blood  cultures should be taken, especially in the case of an advanced immunosuppresive  treatment plan, and it should always be kept in mind that secondary infections  and co-infections may occur.

AB  - An in-hospital rapid method for quantifying the serum level of favipiravir (FPV) in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 was developed by an appropriate  combination of a solid-phase extraction treatment and a reversed-phase HPLC/UV  detection system. The quantification method was well-validated and applied to  measuring the serum FPV level in a clinical practice at a general hospital that  accepts COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, an analysis of data from our preliminary  interaction analysis revealed, for the first time, that FPV selectively forms  complexes with ferric (Fe(3+)) and cupric (Cu(2+)) ions.

AB  - This report presents a case of a 74-year-old man who showed dramatic therapeutic response to treatment of coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) pneumonia.  He reported four-day history of sustained fever and acute progressive dyspnea. He  developed severe respiratory failure, underwent urgent endotracheal intubation  and showed marked elevation of inflammatory and coagulation markers such as  c-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and D-dimer.  Chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated diffuse consolidation and ground  glass opacity (GGO). We diagnosed critical COVID-19 pneumonia with detailed sick  contact history and naso-pharyngeal swab of a  reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay testing. He  received anti-viral drug, anti-interleukin (IL-6) receptor antagonist and  intravenous methylprednisolone. After commencing combined intensive therapy, he  showed dramatic improvement of clinical condition, serum biomarkers and  radiological findings. Early diagnosis and rapid critical care management may  provide meaningful clinical benefit even if severe case. J. Med. Invest. 68 :  192-195, February, 2021.

Severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA) was  not detected with repeated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, but serum  immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 turned positive with  two different assay kits. The patient was thus treated as a probable COVID-19  case, and then recovered through the intensive care including ciclesonide,  favipiravir, and methyl prednisolone. In PCR-negative cases, the diagnosis of  COVID-19 cannot be established at present, but such COVID-19 cases certainly  exist. To avoid a delay in treatment of COVID-19, available diagnostic tools  should be utilized with careful attention for their limitations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic based on in vitro or early clinical  findings. As these drugs are being used in varied regimens and dosages, it is  important to enable synthesis of existing safety data from clinical trials.  However, availability of safety information is limited by a lack of timely  reporting of overall clinical trial results on public registries or through  academic publication. We aimed to analyse the evidence gap in this data by  conducting a rapid review of results posting on ClinicalTrials.gov and in  academic publications to quantify the number of trials missing results for drugs  potentially being repurposed for COVID-19. METHODS: ClinicalTrials.gov was  searched for 19 drugs that have been identified as potential treatments for  COVID-19. Relevant clinical trials for any prior indication were listed by  identifier (NCT number) and checked for results and for timely result reporting  (within 395 days of the primary completion date). Additionally, PubMed and Google  Scholar were searched to identify publications of results not listed on the  registry. A second, blinded search of 10% of trials was conducted to assess  reviewer concordance. RESULTS: Of 3754 completed trials, 1516 (40.4%) did not  post results on ClinicalTrials.gov or in the academic literature. Tabular results  were available on ClinicalTrials.gov for 1172 (31.2%) completed trials. A further  1066 (28.4%) had published results in the academic literature, but did not report  results on ClinicalTrials.gov . Key drugs missing clinical trial results include  hydroxychloroquine (37.0% completed trials unreported), favipiravir (77.8%) and  lopinavir (40.5%). CONCLUSIONS: There is an important evidence gap for the safety  of drugs being repurposed for COVID-19. This uncertainty could cause unnecessary  additional morbidity and mortality during the pandemic. We recommend caution in  experimental drug use for non-severe disease and urge clinical trial sponsors to  report missing results retrospectively.

AB  - The rapid outbreak of the COVID-19 also known as SARS-CoV2 has been declared pandemic with serious global concern. As there is no effective therapeutic  against COVID-19, there is an urgent need for explicit treatment against it. The  focused objective of the current study is to propose promising drug candidates  against the newly identified potential therapeutic target (endonuclease, NSP15)  of SARS-CoV2. NSP15 is an attractive druggable target due to its critical role in  SARS-CoV2 replication and virulence in addition to interference with the host  immune system. Here in the present study, we integrated the high throughput  computational screening and dynamic simulation approach to identify the most  promising candidate lead compound against  NSP15.5-fluoro-2-oxo-1H-pyrazine-3-carboxamide (favipiravir), (3R,4R,  5R)-3,4-Bis(benzyloxy)-5-((benzyloxy) methyl) dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one)  remedesivir, 1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl N-[(2S,3S,  5S)-3-hydroxy-5-[[(2 S)-3-methyl-2-[[methyl-[(2-propan-2-yl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)methyl]carbamoyl]amino]butanoyl]amino]-1,6-diphenylhexan-2-yl]carbamate  (ritonavir), ethyl (3R,4R,  5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-pentan-3-yloxycyclohexene-1-carboxylate (oseltamivir),  and (2 S)-N-[(2S,4S,  5S)-5-[[2-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)acetyl]amino]-4-hydroxy-1,6-diphenylhexan-2-yl]-3-methyl-2-(2-oxo-1,3-diazinan-1-yl)butanamide  (lopinavir) were chosen as a training set to generate the pharmacophore model. A  dataset of ~140,000 compounds library was screened against the designed  pharmacophore model and 10 unique compounds were selected that passed  successfully through geometry constraints, Lipinski Rule of 5, and ADME/Tox  filters along with a strong binding affinity for NSP15 binding cavity. The best  fit compound was selected for dynamic simulation to have detailed structural  features critical for binding with the NSP15 protein. Given our detailed  integrative computational analysis, a Small molecule  (3,3-Dimethyl-N-[4-(1-piperidinylcarbonyl) phenyl] butanamide) with drug-like  properties and high binding affinity with the NSP15 is proposed as a most  promising potential drug against COVID-19. The current computational integrative  approach may complement high-throughput screening and the shortlisted small  molecule may contribute to selective targeting of NSP15 to stop the replication  of SARS-CoV2.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the association between fluoxetine use and the survival of hospitalised coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  pneumonia patients. METHODS: This retrospective case-control study used data  extracted from the medical records of adult patients hospitalised with moderate  or severe COVID-19 pneumonia at the Uzsoki Teaching Hospital of the Semmelweis  University in Budapest, Hungary between 17 March and 22 April 2021. As a part of  standard medical treatment, patients received anti-COVID-19 therapies as  favipiravir, remdesivir, baricitinib or a combination of these drugs; and 110 of  them received 20 mg fluoxetine capsules once daily as an adjuvant medication.  Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between  fluoxetine use and mortality. For excluding a fluoxetine-selection bias  potentially influencing our results, we compared baseline prognostic markers in  the two groups treated versus not treated with fluoxetine. RESULTS: Out of the  269 participants, 205 (76.2%) survived and 64 (23.8%) died between days 2 and 28  after hospitalisation. Greater age (OR [95% CI] 1.08 [1.05-1.11], p<0.001),  radiographic severity based on chest X-ray (OR [95% CI] 2.03 [1.27-3.25],  p=0.003) and higher score of shortened National Early Warning Score (sNEWS) (OR  [95% CI] 1.20 [1.01-1.43], p=0.04) were associated with higher mortality.  Fluoxetine use was associated with an important (70%) decrease of mortality (OR  [95% CI] 0.33 [0.16-0.68], p=0.002) compared to the non-fluoxetine group. Age,  gender, LDH, CRP, and D-dimer levels, sNEWS, Chest X-ray score did not show  statistical difference between the fluoxetine and non-fluoxetine groups  supporting the reliability of our finding. CONCLUSION: Provisional to  confirmation in randomised controlled studies, fluoxetine may be a potent  treatment increasing the survival for COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - Some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients develop rapidly progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome and require veno-venous extracorporeal  membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). A previous study recommended the transfer of  ECMO patients to ECMO centers. However, because of the pandemic, a limited number  of ECMO centers are available for patient transfer. The safe long-distance  interhospital transport of these patients is a concern. To minimize  transportation time, helicopter use is a suitable choice. We report the first  case of a COVID-19 patient on V-V ECMO, transferred to our ECMO center by  helicopter. A 45-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis history, treated with  immunosuppressants, presented with fever and sore throat. He was diagnosed with  COVID-19 following a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  polymerase chain reaction test result and was subsequently prescribed  favipiravir. However, his respiratory failure progressively worsened. On day 10  of hospitalization at the previous hospital, he was intubated, and we received a  request for ECMO transport on the next day. The ECMO team, who wore personal  protective equipment (N95 respirators, gloves, gowns, and face shields),  initiated V-V ECMO in the referring hospital and safely transported the patient  by helicopter. The flight time was 7 min. He was admitted to the intensive care  unit of our hospital and received tocilizumab. He was discharged on hospital day  31 with no significant sequelae. In this case report, we discuss important  factors for the safe and appropriate interhospital transportation of COVID-19  patients on ECMO as well as staff and patient safety during helicopter  transportation.

AB  - Candida auris is a species of fungus that has gained importance in recent years owing to its ability to cause hospital infections and epidemics, resistant to  antifungal agents and disinfection processes and frequently misidentified by  commercial systems. Hospital outbreaks caused by C.auris have been reported from  some countries. It has been determined that C.auris has lower virulence than  Candida albicans; however, it is associated with high mortality rates in  immunocompromised individuals. An increase in the incidence of invasive fungal  infections which can lead to serious complications and death, has been identified  in severe coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) patients or immunocompromised individuals  with underlying disease. Studies demonstrated an increase in the frequency of  C.auris isolation in COVID-19 patients with candidemia. In this report, the first  case of COVID-19 positive C.auris fungemia detected in Turkey was presented. A  71-year-old male patient with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes  mellitus, donation of a single kidney and lobectomy surgery due to lung cancer  was hospitalized in the pandemic thoracic surgery service due to the findings  consistent with viral pneumonia on thoracic computed tomography. Favipiravir 2 x  600 mg and intravenous dexamethasone 1 x 6 mg therapy was administered. The  patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction, and severe  involvement of the left lung was detected in the following days. Antibiotics were  administered, followed by insertion of a right jugular vein catheter and  initation of tocilizumab. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit  due to increased respiratory distress. Yeast growth was detected in the patient's  hemoculture. The yeast strain could not be identified using API ID 32C  (bioMerieux, France) (Sacchromyces kluyveri, Candida sake, unacceptable profile),  but was identified as C.auris using the VITEK MALDI TOF MS (bioMerieux, France)  (99.9%) system and confirmed by sequencing. The minimum inhibitor concentration  values were detected as 3 µg/ml for amphotericin B; > 256 µg/ml for fluconazole;  0.19 µg/ml for voriconazole; 0.19 µg/ml for itraconazole; 0.016 µg/ml for  posaconazole; 1 µg/ml for caspofungin and 0.094 µg/ml for anidulafungin by using  the antibiotic gradient method. The patient's initial treatment comprised  meropenem 3 x 1 g, vancomycin 2 x 1 g, caspofungin 1 x 70 mg, and continued as  caspofungine 1 x 50 mg after the loading dose, and vancomycin 1 x 1 g/48 hours  from the third day of treatment. The patient died on the ninth day after  developing candidemia. The present case is the first case of fungemia caused by  C.auris in a COVID-19 positive patient in Turkey, and it emphasizes the need of  caution for fungemia due to C.auris in intensive care units in our country which  has a high COVID-19 incidence.

AB  - The present work describes development of rapid, robust, sensitive and green spectrofluorimetric method for determination of favipiravir (FAV). Different  factors affecting fluorescence were carefully studied and Box Behnken Design was  applied to optimize experimental parameters. The proposed method is based on  measuring native fluorescence of FAV in 0.2 M borate buffer (pH 8.0) at 432 nm  after excitation at 361 nm. There was a linear relationship between FAV  concentration and relative fluorescence intensity over the range 40-280 ng/mL  with limit of detection of 9.44 ng/mL and quantitation limit of 28.60 ng/mL. The  method was successfully implemented for determination of FAV in its  pharmaceutical formulation with mean % recovery of 99.26 ± 0.87. Moreover, the  high sensitivity of the method allowed determination of FAV in spiked human  plasma over a range of 48-192 ng/mL. The proposed spectrofluorimetric method was  proved to be eco-friendly according to analytical eco-scale.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection increases mortality in hematological malignancies. In a large meta-analysis, patients aged 60 years and older had a significantly  higher risk of death than patients under 60 years of age [1]. Furthermore, a high  risk of death and reduced survival in patients receiving B cell depletion therapy  with prolonged COVID-19 infection was reported in a recent study [2]. High-grade  B-cell lymphomas are classified as morphologically aggressive lymphomas with the  presence of a high mitotic index and Ki-67 proliferation rates. They demonstrate  aggressive behavior clinically as well as morphologically, and COVID-19 infection  is an important factor that increases mortality in these patients. Herein, we  present an elderly patient with a diagnosis of high-grade B-cell lymphoma, in  whom a complete response was observed after prolonged COVID-19 infection. CASE  SUMMARY: An 81-year-old female patient received her first cycle of R-CHOP  (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone) treatment after  being diagnosed with high- grade B-cell lymphoma. After being discharged from the  hospital, the patient was referred to the emergency department with complaints of  fever and fatigue when she came for the second cycle of chemotherapy. Her  COVID-19 PCR test was found positive. She was admitted to the infectious diseases  service and favipiravir treatment was started. On the 24th day of  hospitalization, it was decided to perform interim FDG-PET/CT (Fluorodeoxyglucose  - Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography) scan at a time that her PCR  (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test was still positive. A complete metabolic  response was detected in her imaging. On the 26th day, the PCR test became  negative and the patient was transferred to the oncology service and received the  second cycle of R-CHOP treatment. CONCLUSION: Our case emphasizes that antitumor  effect could be seen in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection and a hematologic  malignancy. It also highlights being alert to prolonged COVID-19 infection in  patients receiving B-cell depletion therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that causes a disease which can leads to a severe form of fatal pneumonia. At december 2020 in Italy, more than 2 million  people have contracted the virus and 78,755 people have died. The scientific  community is studying and testing numerous compounds that can be effective and  safe for treating people with covid-19. AIM: To synthesize and evaluate the  quality of evidence of efficacy and safety for the treatment. The available  evidence is summarized in a living systematic review, a review that is constantly  updated on the basis of the results of the new clinical studies. METHODS: A  bibliographic search is launched weekly on the electronic databases and on the  main clinical trial registers. Two researchers independently select the articles  and assess the quality of the studies using the criteria developed by the  Cochrane Collaboration, the certainty of the overall quality of the evidence is  assessed using the GRADE criteria. RESULTS: At 31/12/2020, 101 randomized  controlled studies were included that consider 72 different comparisons and  include a total of 55,281 patients. 37 drugs are tested with respect to the  standard treatment, 6 are evaluated against placebo and finally 29 compare  different drugs with each other. By selecting studies that evaluate the efficacy  and safety of a drug compared to standard treatment, which include at least 2  studies and which have low to high certainty of evidence, results show that  corticosteroids, remdesivir, favipiravir, immunoglobulins, colchicine, and  umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell infusion could reduce overall mortality. No  differences for the risk of any adverse events are observed between convalescent  plasma and remdesivir compared to standard treatment. Remdesivir probably reduces  the risk of serious adverse events; a similar effect, although less strong, is  also noted for tocilizumab and the lopinavir-ritonavir combination. In contrast,  hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids and convalescent plasma transfusion are  associated with safety concerns with respect to the risk of serious adverse  events. CONCLUSIONS: The 101 studies included consider 72 comparisons and  numerous outcomes, the results often coming from single studies and of small  dimensions, and for 61% with a very low certainty of evidence, are difficult to  summarize and the final result is to increase the uncertainty rather than  providing useful information to the clinic and research. From all the work  carried out it seems to us that the pandemic has highlighted the many shadows of  scientific literature as tool to improve knowledge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 145 million infected people and 3 million deaths worldwide. There has been limited data to  recommend either for or against use of antiviral regimens in mild COVID-19  patients. This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes between mild COVID-19  patients receiving antiviral drugs and those without. METHOD: Thai patients  diagnosed with COVID-19 at field hospital affiliated to Thammasat University  Hospital, Thailand were evaluated between January 1, 2020 and April 13, 2021.  Patients' data, clinical presentation, past medical history, laboratory results,  and treatment outcomes were extensively reviewed. RESULTS: Five hundred patients  with positive tests were included in the study. The mean age was 35.9 years; 46%  males. There were 225 (45%), 207 (41.4%), 44 (8.8%), 18 (3.6%), 6 (1.2%) patients  with asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19, respectively.  Of 207 mild COVID-19 patients, 9 (4.3%) received lopinavir/ritonavir or  darunavir/ritonavir, 17 (8.2%) received favipiravir, while 175 (84.5%) had only  supportive care. Mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral treatment had longer  median length of hospital stay [13 days (IQR 11-14) vs. 10 days (IQR 8-12), p <  0.001] than patients having only supportive treatment. Antiviral drug use was  significantly associated with longer hospital stay (>10 days) in mild COVID-19  patients (OR 5.52; 95%CI 2.12-14.40, p < 0.001). Adverse drug reactions such as  diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hepatitis were also demonstrated in our COVID-19  patients with antiviral treatments. Majority of patients (97.6%) recovered  without any complications and were discharged home. Two deaths were caused by  acute respiratory distress syndrome from severe COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION:  Antiviral treatment could not provide superior clinical outcomes to supportive  care in mild COVID-19 patients. Mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral  medication had longer length of hospital stay than those without. Standard  supportive care and regular monitoring of disease progression might be keys for  successful management of mild COVID-19.

AB  - We present a Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient who developed sudden bilateral vision loss after a bilateral occipital ischemic stroke and without a  history of stroke risk factors. An 84-year-old man was admitted to the emergency  room with bilateral sudden vision loss while receiving Favipiravir treatment for  5 days following a COVID-19 diagnosis. The patient had no history of stroke risk  factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, or  arrhythmia. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of the patient revealed acute  ischemia in the bilateral posterior occipital lobe and bilateral cerebellar  hemisphere. We conclude that COVID-19 may rarely cause bilateral ischemic stroke  presented only in the form of vision loss.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 has wreaked havoc globally and has claimed innumerable lives all over the world. The symptoms of this disease may range from mild influenza-like  symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with high morbidity and  mortality. With improved diagnostic techniques and better disease understanding,  an increased number of cases are being reported with extrapulmonary  manifestations of this disease ranging from renal and gastrointestinal to  cardiac, hepatic, neurological and haematological dysfunction. Subacute  thyroiditis is a self-limiting and painful thyroid gland inflammation most often  secondary to viral infections. We report a case of subacute thyroiditis in a  58-year-old gentleman presenting with a painful swelling in the neck who was  subsequently detected to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. We seek to highlight the  broad clinical spectrum of the COVID-19 by reporting probably the first case of  subacute thyroiditis possibly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection from India.

AB  - CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old Asian male, who had undergone hemodialysis for >16 years, complained of a fever, dysgeusia and dysosmia, and was diagnosed with  COVID-19 pneumonia based on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  polymerase chain reaction (SARS-CoV-2 PCR) and computed tomography (CT).  Treatment was started with oral favipiravir and ciclesonide inhalation. On the  10th day of treatment, the patient had a persistent high fever and a chest CT  showed exacerbation of pneumonia, so dexamethasone was intravenously started. He  was discharged after confirming two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests.  Three months after COVID-19 treatment, a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was negative and he  underwent a deceased donor kidney transplantation. Basiliximab induction with  triple drug immunosuppression consisting of extended-release tacrolimus,  mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone, which is our regular immunosuppression  protocol, was used. He was discharged on postoperative day 18 without the need  for postoperative hemodialysis or any complications. The serum creatinine level  was 1.72 mg/dL 95 days postoperatively and he had a favorable clinical course  that was similar to deceased donor kidney recipients without a history of  SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: We report the first case of a kidney  transplantation after COVID-19 treatment in Japan and the fourth case globally.  We would like to provide information about our successful case due to the  anticipated increase in similar candidates in the near future.

Here we present a surface  plasmon resonance approach to study the interaction of RdRp with drugs in real  time. We monitored the effect of favipiravir, ribavirin, sofosbuvir triphosphate  PSI-7409 and suramin on RdRp binding to RNA immobilized on the chip. Suramin  precluded interaction of RdRp with RNA and even displaced RdRp from RNA.

AB  - We developed a colorimetric analytical method for favipiravir (FPV), a promising treatment for COVID-19. FPV forms yellow complexes with ferrihydrite (Fh) by a  ligand substitution reaction with the iron (III) hydroxyl surface groups in Fh.  Fh-coated microbeads were packed into a capillary tube with an inner diameter of  1 mm. FPV-spiked serum after pretreatment was drawn into the capillary packed  with Fh-coated microbeads. The intensities of the yellow-color complexes on the  microbeads were transformed into red-green-blue (RGB) pixels using Image-J  software 1.8, and the difference between green and blue was used as the  analytical signal. The signal increased with increasing FPV concentration. The  proposed method showed good linearity (R(2) = 0.9907) over a concentration range  of 25-200 μg/mL. The RSD (n = 3) and the LOD (3σ) values were estimated to be  2.8-15.4% and 16.91 μg/mL, respectively. The proposed method enables us to  quantify FPV rapidly and easily without the need for expensive equipment.

AB  - This review article considers the possibilities of combined antiviral therapy in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, based on the analysis of the mechanism  of action of known antiviral drugs in the framework of the medical hypothesis.  The potential effectiveness of the joint use of viral RNA polymerase inhibitors  and a fusion inhibitor in this pathology is discussed. The review discusses the  main representatives of these groups of drugs - ribavirin, riamilovir,  umifenovir, favipiravir. The efficacy and safety profile of these drugs was  analyzed, including the experience of their use in clinical trials conducted  during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as earlier work performed during the SARS  and MERS epidemics.

AB  - Most patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have just only mild symptoms, but about 5% are very severe. Although extracorporeal membranous  oxygenation (ECMO) is sometimes used in critically patients with COVID-19, ECMO  is only an adjunct, not the main treatment. If the patient's condition  deteriorates and it is determined to be irreversible, it is necessary to decide  to stop ECMO. A 54-year-old man was admitted on day 6 of onset with a chief  complaint of high fever and cough. Computed tomography (CT) showed a ground glass  opacity in both lungs, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  (RT-PCR) diagnosed COVID-19. He was admitted to the hospital and started to  receive oxygen and favipiravir. After that, his respiratory condition  deteriorated, and he was intubated and ventilated on day 9 of onset, and ECMO was  introduced on day 12. Two days after the introduction of ECMO, C-reactive protein  (CRP) increased, chest X-p showed no improvement in pneumonia, and PaO2/FiO2  decreased again. As D-dimer rose and found a blood clot in the ECMO circuit, we  had to decide whether to replace the circuit and continue with ECMO or stop ECMO.  At this time, the viral load by RT-PCR was drastically reduced to about 1/1750.  We decided to continue ECMO therapy and replaced the circuit. The patient's  respiratory status subsequently improved and ECMO was stopped on day 21 of onset.  In conclusion, viral load measurement by RT-PCR may be one of the indicators for  promoting the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has spread worldwide, with no sign of its control in Japan yet. Eight elderly COVID-19 patients over 90 years  of age were treated at our hospital. We herein report three cases with  characteristic progression. Case 1 was a 91-year-old female patient diagnosed  with bacterial pneumonia previously who did not show improvement with medication;  thus, she was transferred to our hospital 16 days after the onset. She was  diagnosed with COVID-19 using the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  test. Favipiravir, methylprednisolone, and unfractionated heparin were  administered, but she only tested negative 68 days after the onset, at which  point she was discharged. However, she was transferred back to our hospital 80  days after the onset since she tested positive again. She was transferred to  another hospital 110 days after the onset without testing negative. Case 2 was a  102-year-old female. Despite being a mild case, it took 32 days to obtain  negative PCR findings, leading to a decline in the activities of daily living.  Case 3 was a 90-year-old male patient treated with favipiravir, dexamethasone,  and unfractionated heparin, but his condition deteriorated. He never tested  negative for PCR and ultimately died 20 days after the onset. Reports suggest  that PCR positivity does not necessarily indicate infectivity, but there are no  clear criteria for lifting a quarantine. Therefore, PCR negativity is often  sought for "peace of mind." In the current situation where hospitals are fully  occupied, clear criteria for lifting the quarantine should be promptly  determined. After the completion of treatment, it is more important to monitor  symptoms and take standard precautions, such as daily health monitoring, wearing  a mask, and keeping an appropriate distance from others, than to obtain a  negative PCR result.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The GETAFIX trial will test the hypothesis that favipiravir is a more effective treatment for COVID-19 infection in patients who have early stage  disease, compared to current standard of care. This study will also provide an  important opportunity to investigate the safety and tolerability of favipiravir,  the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of this drug and mechanisms of  resistance in the context of COVID-19 infection, as well as the effect of  favipiravir on hospitalisation duration and the post COVID-19 health and  psycho-social wellbeing of patients recruited to the study. TRIAL DESIGN: GETAFIX  is an open label, parallel group, two arm phase II/III randomised trial with 1:1  treatment allocation ratio. Patients will be randomised to one of two arms and  the primary endpoint will assess the superiority of favipiravir plus standard  treatment compared to standard treatment alone. PARTICIPANTS: This trial will  recruit adult patients with confirmed positive valid COVID-19 test, who are not  pregnant or breastfeeding and have no prior major co-morbidities. This is a  multi-centre trial, patients will be recruited from in-patients and outpatients  from three Glasgow hospitals: Royal Alexandra Hospital; Queen Elizabeth  University Hospital; and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Patients must meet all of  the following criteria: 1. Age 16 or over at time of consent 2. Exhibiting  symptoms associated with COVID-19 3. Positive for SARS-CoV-2 on valid COVID-19  test 4. Point 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the WHO COVID-19 ordinal severity scale at time of  randomisation. (Asymptomatic with positive valid COVID-19 test, Symptomatic  Independent, Symptomatic assistance needed, Hospitalized, with no oxygen therapy)  5. Have >=10% risk of death should they be admitted to hospital as defined by the  ISARIC4C risk index: https://isaric4c.net/risk 6. Able to provide written  informed consent 7. Negative pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential*) 8.  Able to swallow oral medication Patients will be excluded from the trial if they  meet any of the following criteria: 1. Renal impairment requiring, or likely to  require, dialysis or haemofiltration 2. Pregnant or breastfeeding 3. Of child  bearing potential (women), or with female partners of child bearing potential  (men) who do not agree to use adequate contraceptive measures for the duration of  the study and for 3 months after the completion of study treatment 4. History of  hereditary xanthinuria 5. Other patients judged unsuitable by the Principal  Investigator or sub-Investigator 6. Known hypersensitivity to favipiravir, its  metabolites or any excipients 7. Severe co-morbidities including: patients with  severe hepatic impairment, defined as:  • greater than Child-Pugh grade A  • AST  or ALT > 5 x ULN  • AST or ALT >3 x ULN and Total Bilirubin > 2xULN 8. More than  96 hours since first positive COVID-19 test sample was taken 9. Unable to  discontinue contra-indicated concomitant medications This is a multi-centre  trial, patients will be recruited from in-patients and outpatients from three  Glasgow hospitals: Royal Alexandra Hospital; Queen Elizabeth University Hospital;  and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised  to the experimental arm of GETAFIX will receive standard treatment for COVID-19  at the discretion of the treating clinician plus favipiravir. These patients will  receive a loading dose of favipiravir on day 1 of 3600mg (1800mg 12 hours apart).  On days 2-10, patients in the experimental arm will receive a maintenance dose of  favipiravir of 800mg 12 hours apart (total of 18 doses). Patients randomised to  the control arm of the GETAFIX trial will receive standard treatment for COVID-19  at the discretion of the treating clinician. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome  being assessed in the GETAFIX trial is the efficacy of favipiravir in addition to  standard treatment in patients with COVID-19 in reducing the severity of disease  compared to standard treatment alone. Disease severity will be assessed using WHO  COVID 10 point ordinal severity scale at day 15 +/- 48 hours. All randomised  participants will be followed up until death or 60 days post-randomisation  (whichever is sooner). RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomised 1:1 to the  experimental versus control arm using computer generated random sequence  allocation. A minimisation algorithm incorporating a random component will be  used to allocate patients. The factors used in the minimisation will be: site,  age (16-50/51-70/71+), history of hypertension or currently obsess (BMI>30 or  obesity clinically evident; yes/no), 7 days duration of symptoms  (yes/no/unknown), sex (male/female), WHO COVID-19 ordinal severity score at  baseline (1/2or 3/4). BLINDING (MASKING): No blinding will be used in the GETAFIX  trial. Both participants and those assessing outcomes will be aware of treatment  allocation. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): In total, 302 patients will  be randomised to the GETAFIX trial: 151 to the control arm and 151 to the  experimental arm. There will be an optional consent form for patients who may  want to contribute to more frequent PK and PD sampling. The maximum number of  patients who will undergo this testing will be sixteen, eight males and eight  females. This option will be offered to all patients who are being treated in  hospital at the time of taking informed consent, however only patients in the  experimental arm of the trial will be able to undergo this testing. TRIAL STATUS:  The current GETAFIX protocol is version 4.0 12(th) September 2020. GETAFIX opened  to recruitment on 26(th) October 2020 and will recruit patients over a period of  approximately six months. TRIAL REGISTRATION: GETAFIX was registered on the  European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) Database on  15(th) April 2020; Reference number 2020-001904-41 (  https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-001904-41/GB ).  GETAFIX was registered on ISRCTN on 7(th) September 2020; Reference number  ISRCTN31062548 ( https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN31062548 ). FULL PROTOCOL: The full  protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website  (Additional file 1). In the interest in expediting dissemination of this  material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a  summary of the key elements of the full protocol. The study protocol has been  reported in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for  Clinical Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (see Additional file 2).

AB  - The development of specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection is a major challenge facing global science and healthcare. Despite numerous attempts, there  are still no truly effective drugs. Currently, the main approach in the creation  of drugs against COVID-19 is repurposing, i.e., re-profiling existing drugs  approved for medical use, for example, the use of a drug for the treatment of  Ebola-Remdesivir, and the use of a drug for the treatment of  influenza-Favipiravir. However, it is already obvious that these drugs are not  specific enough nor effective enough. Another promising approach is the creation  of new molecules, but it should be noted immediately that implementation requires  much more time and costs. However, the search for new SARS-CoV-2 specific  antiviral agents continues. The aim of our work was the creation of new  5-substituted uridine derivatives as potential inhibitors of coronavirus  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The substances were obtained in high yields by the  Suzuki-Miyaura reaction and characterized using modern physicochemical methods.  However, testing of their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 did not reveal a  significant inhibitory effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of Covid-19 infection on nasal mucociliary clearance (MCC) is unknown. AIMS/OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate the  relationship between Covid-19 and nasal MCC in terms of smoking, Covid-19  symptoms and treatment. METHODS: Thirty-six patients who were hospitalized in the  pandemic ward due to Covid-19 and 36 volunteers (Covid-19 negative test result)  who presented to the otolaryngology outpatient clinic with non-nasal symptoms  were included in this study. The Saccharin test was performed in both groups to  evaluate nasal MCC. RESULTS: The patients and control groups were not  significantly different in terms of age and gender. The nasal MCC time was  significantly higher in the patient group compared to the control group  (19.18 ± 10.84 min and 13.78 ± 8.18 min, p = .003). CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE:  In this study, we found that Covid-19 prolonged nasal MCC time regardless of age.  We suggest that corticosteroids should be included in the treatment of Covid-19,  both with its symptom reduction and its positive effect on MCC duration.

AB  - At the time of writing this review, severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 2,355,853 patients and resulted in  more than 164,656 deaths worldwide (as of 20 April 2020). This review highlights  the preventive measures, available clinical therapies and the potential of  vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 by taking into consideration the strong  genetic similarities of the 2003 epidemic SARS-CoV. Recent studies are  investigating the repurposing of US FDA-approved drugs as there is no available  vaccine yet with many attempts under clinical evaluation. Several antivirals,  antimalarials and immunomodulators that have shown activity against SARS-CoV and  Middle East coronavirus respiratory syndromes are being evaluated. In particular,  hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, arbidol, tocilizumab and bevacizumab  have shown promising results. The main aim of this review is to provide an  overview of this pandemic and where we currently stand.

T2  - Journal of proteome research
AB  - Since the novel coronavirus pandemic, people around the world have been touched in varying degrees, and this pandemic has raised a major global health concern.  As there is no effective drug or vaccine, it is urgent to find therapeutic drugs  that can serve to deal with the current epidemic situation in all countries and  regions. We searched drugs and response measures for SARS-CoV-2 in the PubMed  database, and then updated the potential targets and therapeutic drugs from the  perspective of the viral replication cycle. The drug research studies of the  viral replication cycle are predominantly focused on the process of the virus  entering cells, proteases, and RdRp. The inhibitors of the virus entry to cells  and RdRp, such as Arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, EIDD-2081, and ribavirin, are  in clinical trials, while most of the protease inhibitors are mainly calculated  by molecular docking technology, which needs in vivo and in vitro experiments to  prove the effect for SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes the drugs targeting the  viral replication process and provides a basis and directions for future drug  development and reuse on the protein level of COVID-19.

AB  - To date the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2), known as COVID-19, is for clinicians the most difficult global therapeutic problem. In  this landscape, the management of patients with chronic kidney disease, acute  kidney injury or patients undergoing immunosuppressant therapies for kidney  transplant or glomerular diseases, represent a clinical challenge for  nephrologists, especially in patients with severe acute lung involvement.  Therefore in this setting, due to the lack of anti-COVID treatment schedules,  tailored management is mandatory to reduce the side effects, as consequence of  impaired renal function and drugs interactions. We report the main treatment  actually used against SARS-CoV-2, underlining its possible use in the nephropatic  patients and the central role of nephrologists to improve the clinical outcome.

AB  - The fight against the novel coronavirus pneumonia (namely COVID-19) that seriously harms human health is a common task for all mankind. Currently,  development of drugs against the novel coronavirus (namely SARS-CoV-2) is quite  urgent. Chinese medical workers and scientific researchers have found some drugs  to play potential therapeutic effects on COVID-19 at the cellular level or in  preliminary clinical trials. However, more fundamental studies and large sample  clinical trials need to be done to ensure the efficacy and safety of these drugs.  The adoption of these drugs without further testing must be careful. The relevant  articles, news, and government reports published on the official and Preprint  websites, PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases  from December 2019 to April 2020 were searched and manually filtered. The general  pharmacological characteristics, indications, adverse reactions, general usage,  and especially current status of the treatment of COVID-19 of those potentially  effective drugs, including chemical drugs, traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs),  and biological products in China were summarized in this review to guide  reasonable medication and the development of specific drugs for the treatment of  COVID-19.

AB  - We started a study on the molecular docking of six potential pharmacologically active inhibitors compounds that can be used clinically against the COVID-19  virus, in this case, remdesivir, ribavirin, favipiravir, galidesivir,  hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine interacting with the main COVID-19 protease in  complex with a COVID-19 N3 protease inhibitor. The highest values of affinity  energy found in order from highest to lowest were chloroquine (CHL),  hydroxychloroquine (HYC), favipiravir (FAV), galidesivir (GAL), remdesivir (REM)  and ribavirin (RIB). The possible formation of hydrogen bonds, associations  through London forces and permanent electric dipole were analyzed. The values of  affinity energy obtained for the hydroxychloroquine ligands was -9.9 kcal/mol and  for the chloroquine of -10.8 kcal/mol which indicate that the coupling  contributes to an effective improvement of the affinity energies with the  protease. Indicating that, the position chosen to make the substitutions may be a  pharmacophoric group, and cause changes in the protease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus called as SARS-CoV-2. This viral disease is known  to infect the respiratory system, eventually leading to pneumonia.  Crystallographic studies of the viral structure reveal its mechanism of infection  as well as active binding sites and the druggable targets as scope for treatment  of COVID-19. HYPOTHESIS: The role of tea polyphenols in prophylaxis and treatment  of COVID-19 was established in this study. STUDY DESIGN: Molecular docking  interactions of tea polyphenols with some of the possible binding sites of  SARS-CoV-2 were performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From various studies on the  SARS-CoV-2 reported in the literature, we chose possible drug targets  (Chymotrypsin-like protease, RNA dependant RNA polymerase, Papain like protease,  Spike RBD and ACE2 receptor with spike RBD) which are vital proteins. These  receptors were docked against two tea polyphenols, Epigallocatechin gallate  (EGCG) from green tea and Theaflavin digallate (TF3) from black tea. These  polyphenols have been previously reviewed for their antiviral activities,  especially against single-stranded RNA viruses. Two antiviral drugs, Remdesivir  and Favipiravir were studied for comparative docking results. RESULTS: A  comparative study of docking scores and the type of interactions of EGCG, TF3  with the possible targets of COVID-19 showed that the tea polyphenols had good  docking scores with significant in-silico activity. CONCLUSION: These results can  provide a lead in exploring both the tea polyphenols in prophylaxis as well as  treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - The new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is associated with a wide variety of cutaneous manifestations. Although new skin  manifestations caused by COVID-19 are continuously being described, other  cutaneous entities should also be considered in the differential diagnosis,  including adverse cutaneous reactions to drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19  infections. The aim of this review is to provide dermatologists with an overview  of the cutaneous adverse effects associated with the most frequently prescribed  drugs in patients with COVID-19. The skin reactions of antimalarials (chloroquine  and hydroxychloroquine), antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin with or  without interferon, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and darunavir), and  treatments for complications (imatinib, tocilizumab, anakinra, immunoglobulins,  corticosteroids, colchicine and low molecular weight heparins) are analyzed.  Information regarding possible skin reactions, their frequency, management, and  key points for differential diagnosis are presented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of mild-severe COVID-19 pneumonia cases in liver transplant (LT) recipients.  METHODS: Ten LT recipients diagnosed as having COVID-19 pneumonia in a 6-month  period in our transplantation center were included. Demographic and medical data  of the recipients were retrospectively collected; clinical courses, treatment  responses, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Ten LT recipients were male, had  a median age of 57 years (min-max, 36-69 years; interquartile range [IQR], 13  years), and had right lobe from living donor LT performed in a median of 11  months (min-max, 1-72 months; IQR, 12 months). Five patients had severe  pneumonia, and the remaining patients had mild/moderate pneumonia. The most  frequent symptoms were fever (90%) and cough (70%). Favipiravir, enoxaparin  sodium, and corticosteroid were initiated at the time of the diagnosis;  immunosuppressive drug doses were reduced or discontinued in 3 cases. Lymphopenia  median: 510/mL (min-max, 90-1400 mL; IQR, 610 mL), increased levels of C-reactive  protein median: 4.72 (min-max, 0.31-23.4; IQR, 8.5), and ferritin median: 641  (min-max, 40 to ≥ 1650; IQR, 1108) were frequent. Four patients required  antibacterial treatments because of emerging bacterial pneumonia and/or sepsis.  All patients were hospitalized for a median of 10 days. One patient with sepsis  died on the 26th day after intensive care unit admission, and the remaining 9  survived. No further complication was recorded for 1-month follow-up.  CONCLUSIONS: Commencing favipiravir, enoxaparin sodium, and corticosteroid  treatments; close follow-up of the developing complications; the temporary  reduction or cessation of immunosuppression; a multidisciplinary approach; early  awareness of the bacterial infections; and the initiation appropriate antibiotic  treatments can contribute to success.

AB  - COVID-19 is a global health crisis that has impacted the world with heavy economic and social losses. In the early days of the pandemic, pediatric COVID-19  was well-known for its low infectivity and mortality rates as well as its benign  clinical outcomes. Herein, we report the case of a 6-year-old girl with  COVID-19-associated encephalopathy without respiratory symptoms. To the best of  our knowledge, this is the first child reported from Saudi Arabia with  COVID-19-induced encephalopathy. A 6-year-old patient with COVID-19 was presented  to the Abha Maternity and Child Hospital in southeastern Saudi Arabia. Routine  clinical and laboratory examinations revealed normal findings. Despite the  absence of COVID-19 respiratory manifestations, the patient manifested  COVID-19-related encephalopathy. The patient responded well to pulse steroid,  favipiravir, and symptomatic seizure therapies. The patient recovered completely  without any neurologic morbidities. A COVID-19-related encephalopathy was  observed for the first time in Saudi Arabia among pediatric patients. Clinicians  should be alert to potential neurologic complications associated with COVID-19.  It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with  acute encephalopathy, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. To avoid  long-term neurologic sequelae, prompt seizure and immunosuppressive therapies are  essential.

AB  - This research developed and validated a highly sensitive and selective UPLC-MS/MS approach using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for quantifying favipiravir.  Moreover, we introduced a study evaluating bioequivalence using two drugs,  Favibrivix and Avigan, containing favipiravir. Lean Six Sigma verified the  capacity and performance of the process. Protein precipitation extraction was  utilized to extract favipiravir from the collected human matrices. We used an  Acquity UPLCr BEH HILIC column and valproic acid as an internal standard.  Furthermore, we conducted the procedure using an isocratic elution comprising  acetonitrile and 0.005% ammonia in water (75:25, v/v), a flow rate of  0.25 ml/min, a temperature controlled at 10°C and an injection volume of 1.0 μl.  Our UPLC-MS/MS process has a broad range (50-10,000 ng/ml) with a determination  coefficient of 0.9980. We validated the method in line with the US Food and Drug  Administration. The findings revealed that the test, Favibrivix 200 mg/tablet,  and the reference, Avigan® 200 mg/tablet, were statistically bioequivalent in  healthy Egyptian participants.

AB  - Despite to outbreaks of highly pathogenic beta and alpha coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory  syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and human coronavirus, the newly emerged 2019  coronavirus (COVID-19) is considered as a lethal zoonotic virus due to its deadly  respiratory syndrome and high mortality rate among the human. Globally, more than  3,517,345 cases have been confirmed with 243,401 deaths due to Acute Respiratory  Distress Syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19. The antiviral drug discovery  activity is required to control the persistence of COVID-19 circulation and the  potential of the future emergence of coronavirus. However, the present review  aims to highlight the important antiviral approaches, including interferons,  ribavirin, mycophenolic acids, ritonavir, lopinavir, inhibitors, and monoclonal  antibodies (mAbs) to provoke the nonstructural proteins and deactivate the  structural and essential host elements of the virus to control and treat the  infection of COVID-19 by inhibiting the viral entry, viral RNA replication and  suppressing the viral protein expression. Moreover, the present review  investigates the epidemiology, diagnosis, structure, and replication of COVID-19  for better understanding. It is recommended that these proteases, inhibitors, and  antibodies could be a good therapeutic option in drug discovery to control the  newly emerged coronavirus.HighlightsCOVID-19 has more than 79.5% identical  sequence to SARS-CoV and a 96% identical sequence of the whole genome of bat  coronaviruses.Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and  septic shock are the possible clinical symptoms associated with  COVID-19.Different antivirals, including interferons, ribavirin, lopinavir, and  monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could be the potent therapeutic agents against  COVID-19.The initial clinical trials on hydroquinone in combination with  azithromycin showed an admirable result in the reduction of COVID-19.The  overexpression of inflammation response, cytokine dysregulation, and induction of  apoptosis could be an well-organized factors to reduce the pathogenicity of  COVID-19.

AB  - Use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is not  well described. A 58-year-old man with fever and progressive dyspnea was admitted  to the Showa University Hospital, and showed severe respiratory failure which  needed mechanical ventilation. His chest computed tomography scanning showed  emphysema and bilateral ground-glass opacity caused by severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. He received 30 mg prednisolone for  five days with antiviral drug of favipiravir, and was successfully extubated on  day five. A SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test became negative on  day 15. He was discharged on day 21. Serum IgM and IgG antibodies against  SARS-CoV-2 converted to positive on day 7 and they kept positive on day 54 for  both IgM and IgG. Combination treatment of short-course systemic corticosteroid  and favipiravir might improve the prognosis for critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia  with COPD without negative influence on viral clearance or antibody production.

T2  - Therapeutic advances in infectious disease
AB  - The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has caused significant morbidity and mortality among infected individuals across the world. High transmissibility rate  of the causative virus - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) - has led to immense strain and bottlenecking of the health care  system. While noteworthy advances in vaccine development have been made amid the  current global pandemic, most therapeutic agents are repurposed from use in other  viral infections and are being evaluated for efficacy in COVID-19. Favipiravir,  an orally administered drug originally developed in Japan against emerging  influenza viral strains, has been shown to have widespread application and safety  across multiple ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral infections. With a strong affinity  toward the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), favipiravir could be a  promising therapy against SARS-CoV-2, by targeting downstream viral RNA  replication. Initial trials for usage in COVID-19 have suggested that favipiravir  administration during initial infection stages, in individuals with mild to  moderate infection, has a strong potential to improve clinical outcomes. However,  additional well-designed clinical trials are required to closely examine ideal  timing of drug administration, dosage, and duration, to assess the role of  favipiravir in COVID-19 therapy. This review provides evidence-based insights and  throws light on the current clinical trials examining the efficacy of favipiravir  in tackling COVID-19, including its mechanism, pharmacodynamics, and  pharmacokinetics.

TI  - Pharmacogenomics and COVID-19: clinical implications of human genome interactions with repurposed drugs.
AU  - Badary, Osama A.
T2  - The pharmacogenomics journal
AB  - The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an emergent global pandemic. Many drugs without established efficacy are being used to treat  COVID-19 patients either as an offlabel/compassionate use or as a clinical trial.  Although drug repurposing is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost,  there is a need to make predictions on success before the start of therapy. For  the optimum use of these repurposed drugs, many factors should be considered such  as drug-gene or dug-drug interactions, drug toxicity, and patient co-morbidity.  There is limited data on the pharmacogenomics of these agents and this may  constitute an obstacle for successful COVID-19 therapy. This article reviewed the  available human genome interactions with some promising repurposed drugs for  COVID-19 management. These drugs include chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine  (HCQ), azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), atazanavir (ATV), favipiravir  (FVP), nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), oseltamivir, remdesivir, anakinra,  tocilizumab (TCZ), eculizumab, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) regulators,  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, ivermectin, and  nitazoxanide. Drug-gene variant pairs that may alter the therapeutic outcomes in  COVID-19 patients are presented. The major drug variant pairs that associated  with variations in clinical efficacy include CQ/HCQ (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, ACE2, and  HO-1); azithromycin (ABCB1); LPV/r (SLCO1B1, ABCB1, ABCC2 and CYP3A); NVP  (ABCC10); oseltamivir (CES1 and ABCB1); remdesivir (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and  OATP1B1); anakinra (IL-1a); and TCZ (IL6R and FCGR3A). The major drug variant  pairs that associated with variations in adverse effects include CQ/HCQ (G6PD;  hemolysis and ABCA4; retinopathy), ATV (MDR1 and UGT1A1*28; hyperbilirubinemia;  and APOA5; dyslipidemia), NVP (HLA-DRB1*01, HLA-B*3505 and CYP2B6; skin rash and  MDR1; hepatotoxicity), and EFV (CYP2B6; depression and suicidal tendencies).

AU  - Noor, Rashed
T2  - Tzu chi medical journal
AB  - So far, lots of analyses have been conducted to invent the appropriate therapeutic targets for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2). The category and the strategies for treating the virus are  described in this review together with mentioning some specific drugs. Of them,  saikosaponin possesses affinity of the drug toward nonstructural protein 15 and  the spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. The nucleotide inhibitors such as  sofosbuvir, ribavirin, galidesivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, cefuroxime,  tenofovir, and hydroxychloroquine (HCHL), setrobuvir, YAK, and IDX-184 were found  to be effective in binding to SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. From the  antimalarial and anti-inflammatory category, chloroquine and its derivative HCHL  have already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency  treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The other drugs such as favipiravir and  lopinavir/ritonavir under the antiviral category, the angiotensin-converting  enzyme 2 (the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors), remdesivir (RNA polymerase  inhibitor) from antiviral category, cepharanthine from anti-inflammatory  category, etc., have been pointed based on the previous literature published.  Besides, the assessment of the drug repositioning candidates with the related  targets is also significant for the viral mitigation.

AB  - So far, there is a lack of effective drugs for the new coronavirus pneumonia. With more and more patients diagnosed, China has carried out more than 100  clinical studies of new coronavirus infection, including antiviral drugs,  antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, virus vaccine, and other  Western drugs, while Chinese medicine research accounted for half of the studies.  Most of the trials were initiated by investigators and the study period would  last for 1 to 11 months. The primary endpoints included symptom improvement and  virus nucleic acid turning negative, but the optimal endpoint has not been  determined. Although the final results of studies will take a long time to  complete, the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent  demand for drug treatment. Compared with that of during SARS period in 2003,  China has the stronger capability to carry out clinical trials of new drugs in  emergency period.

T2  - Virusdisease
AB  - Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the prime global health concern of the year 2020. Infecting more than 112 million individuals so far, this pandemic has  already reported more than 2.4 million deaths around the world. With such high  infectivity and mortality, effective treatment intervention is the need of the  hour. The integration of medical science with nanotechnology may solve the  current problem by exploring collective benefits. In this manuscript, we  theoretically proposed the duo-combination of an approved antiviral i.e.  favipiravir along with an immunomodulator i.e. tocilizumab loaded in  protein-lipid nanovesicles as an effective anti-COVID-19 therapeutic. This  proposed nanomedicine delivered through the respiratory mode may enhance the  effectiveness of the antiviral and help in restricting the virus and associated  complications, utilizing both anti-viral activity and immunomodulation in  COVID-19 patients. This proposed nanomedicine could be an effective treatment  modality for the severe acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)  infected patients.

AB  - The COVID-19-related death rate varies between countries and is affected by various risk factors. This multicenter registry study was designed to evaluate  the mortality rate and the related risk factors in Turkey. We retrospectively  evaluated 1500 adults with COVID-19 from 26 centers who were hospitalized between  March 11 and July 31, 2020. In the study group, 1041 and 459 cases were diagnosed  as definite and highly probable cases, respectively. There were 993 PCR-positive  cases (66.2%). Among all cases, 1144 (76.3%) were diagnosed with non-severe  pneumonia, whereas 212 (14.1%) had severe pneumonia. Death occurred in 67  patients, corresponding to a mortality rate of 4.5% (95% CI:3.5-5.6). The  univariate analysis demonstrated that various factors, including male sex, age  ≥65 years and the presence of dyspnea or confusion, malignity, chronic  obstructive lung disease, interstitial lung disease, immunosuppressive  conditions, severe pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, and sepsis, were positively  associated with mortality. Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were  not associated with survival. Following multivariate analysis, male sex, severe  pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, malignancy, sepsis and interstitial lung  diseases were found to be independent risk factors for mortality. Among the  biomarkers, procalcitonin levels on the 3rd-5th days of admission showed the  strongest associations with mortality (OR: 6.18; 1.6-23.93). This study  demonstrated that the mortality rate in hospitalized patients in the early phase  of the COVID-19 pandemic was a serious threat and that those patients with male  sex, severe pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, malignancy, sepsis and  interstitial lung diseases were at increased risk of mortality; therefore, such  patients should be closely monitored.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 has been highly controversial. In our research, we aimed to investigate the effects of  hydroxychloroquine on disease outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.  METHODOLOGY: A total of 393 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were  retrospectively assigned to the standard of care therapy group (n = 180) or the  standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group (n = 213). The standard of care  therapy comprised favipiravir, low molecular weight heparin, acetylsalicylic  acid. Status of oxygenation at baseline and on the seventh day, laboratory tests  at baseline and at discharge were recorded. Length of hospital stay,  administration of anti-inflammatory treatment, admission to the intensive care  unit and 28th day mortality were set as primary endpoints. RESULTS: There were no  statistically significant differences between groups in terms of oxygen delivery  route and mortality after seven days of treatment (p = 0.592). C-reactive protein  levels of the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group were significantly  lower than that of the standard of care group at discharge (p = 0.034). Patients  in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group had shorter hospital stay  (p = 0.007). The standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was favored over  standard of care group in terms of rate of intensive care unit admissions (21.7%  vs. 10.8%; relative risk with 95% CI = 0.49 [0.31-0.80], p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS:  Hydroxychloroquine in addition to standard of care was associated with less  intensive care unit admissions, early discharge and greater C-reactive protein  reduction. There was no difference in 28-day mortality.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is wreaking havoc on worldwide public health and economies has heightened awareness about the lack of effective  antiviral treatments for human coronaviruses (CoVs). Many current antivirals,  notably nucleoside analogs (NAs), exert their effect by incorporation into viral  genomes and subsequent disruption of viral replication and fidelity. The  development of anti-CoV drugs has long been hindered by the capacity of CoVs to  proofread and remove mismatched nucleotides during genome replication and  transcription. Here, we review the molecular basis of the CoV proofreading  complex and evaluate its potential as a drug target. We also consider existing  nucleoside analogs and novel genomic techniques as potential anti-CoV  therapeutics that could be used individually or in combination to target the  proofreading mechanism.

AB  - Amid the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the search for effective treatment and vaccines has been exponentially on the  rise. Finding effective treatment has been the core of attention of many  scientific reports and antivirals are in the center of those treatments. Numerous  antivirals are being studied for the management of the coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir was the first drug to  gain emergency FDA approval to be used in COVID-19. Similarly, favipiravir, an  anti-influenza drug, is being studied as a potential agent against COVID-19.  Contrastingly, hydroxychloroquine has been a controversial drug in the management  of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the National Institute of Health (NIH), along with the  World Health Organization (WHO), have discontinued clinical trials for  hydroxychloroquine as the drug showed little or no survival benefit. Ivermectin,  an antihelminthic drug, has shown antiviral properties previously. Additionally,  it was described to be effective in vivo against the SARS-CoV-2. However, its  survival benefit in patients with COVID-19 has not been documented. We herein  propose the theory of inhaled ivermectin which can attain the desired lung  concentration that will render it effective against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present an interesting case of unusual side effect of Mycobacterium W. in an adult COVID 19 positive male and discuss its assessment and management.  METHODS: - DESIGN: Case Report. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PATIENT: One.  RESULTS: 70 years male was admitted with complaints of fever, persistent dry  cough since 10-12 days and progressive breathlessness since 3-4 days. Patient was  found COVID-19 RTPCR positive and is known case of Type-II Diabetes with CAD  (Post PTCA). Patient was managed conservatively with Oxygen support, I/V  antibiotics, I/V Steroids, oral Favipiravir and other supportive treatment.  Patient was also given injection Mycobacterium W. in dose of 0.3 ml per day  intradermally at 3 different sites (both deltoids) consecutively for three days.  7-8 days after administration, patient developed bright red pustules which later  got converted into small punched out ulcerations on all nine local sites of  administration, which were managed conservatively with oral analgesics and local  steroids for 8-10 days which healed without any scar formation. CONCLUSION:  Injection Mycobacterium W. is used in COVID 19 patients as an immunomodulator  agent and has been proved to be safe in most of the cases but we encountered this  unusual side effect of bright red pustules formation at all nine local sites of  injection in our case most likely because of being administered subcutaneously  instead of intradermally, making this an interesting case which is being reported  to scientific fraternity.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rapidly spread globally. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, is  a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a reported fatality rate ranging  from 1% to 7%, and people with immune-compromised conditions, children, and older  adults are particularly vulnerable. Respiratory failure and cytokine  storm-induced multiple organ failure are the major causes of death. This article  highlights the innate and adaptive immune mechanisms of host cells activated in  response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible therapeutic approaches against  COVID-19. Some potential drugs proven to be effective for other viral diseases  are under clinical trials now for use against COVID-19. Examples include  inhibitors of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin),  viral protein synthesis (ivermectin, lopinavir/ ritonavir), and fusion of the  viral membrane with host cells (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide,  and umifenovir). This article also presents the intellectual groundwork for the  ongoing development of vaccines in preclinical and clinical trials, explaining  potential candidates (live attenuated-whole virus vaccines, inactivated vaccines,  subunit vaccines, DNAbased vaccines, protein-based vaccines, nanoparticle-based  vaccines, virus-like particles and mRNA-based vaccines). Designing and developing  an effective vaccine (both prophylactic and therapeutic) would be a long-term  solution and the most effective way to eliminate the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - This work aimed at evaluating the inhibitory effect of ten natural bioactive compounds (1-10) as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2-3CL main protease (PDB ID:  6LU7) and SARS-CoV main proteases (PDB IDs: 2GTB and 3TNT) by molecular docking  analysis. The inhibitory effect of all studied compounds was studied with  compared to some proposed antiviral drugs which currently used in COVID-19  treatment such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir,  baloxvir, lopinavir, and favipiravir. Homology modeling and sequence alignment  was computed to evaluate the similarity between the SARS-CoV-2-3CL main protease  and other SARS-CoV receptors. ADMET properties of all studied compounds were  computed and reported. Also, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was performed on  the compound which has the highest binding affinity inside 6LU7 obtained from  molecular docking analysis to study it is stability inside receptor in explicit  water solvent. Based on molecular docking analysis, we found that caulerpin has  the highest binding affinity inside all studied receptors compared to other  bioactive compounds and studied drugs. Our homology modeling and sequence  alignment showed that SARS-CoV main protease (PDB ID: 3TNT) shares high  similarity with 3CLpro (96.00%). Also, ADMET properties confirmed that caulerpin  obeys Lipinski's rule and passes ADMET property, which make it a promising  compound to act as a new safe natural drug against SARS-CoV-2-3CL main protease.  Finally, MD simulation confirmed that the complex formed between caulerpin and  3CLpro is stable in water explicit and had no major effect on the flexibility of  the protein throughout the simulations and provided a suitable basis for our  study. Also, binding free energy between caulerpin and 6LU7 confirmed the  efficacy of the caulerpin molecule against SARS-CoV-2 main protease. So, this  study suggested that caulerpin could be used as a potential candidate in COVID-19  treatment.

FPV was approved in Japan in 2014 for therapy of influenza  unresponsive to standard antiviral therapies. FPV was also used in the therapy of  Ebola virus disease (EVD) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of action,  pharmacokinetic parameters, toxicity, and adverse effects of FPV, as well as  clinical studies evaluating the use of FPV in the therapy of influenza virus (IV)  infection, EVD, and SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with its effectiveness in  treating other human RNA infections.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), first reported in China during December of 2019, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2). Infection later spread very rapidly around the globe with over  8,708,008 cases reported, including more than 461,715 deaths reported across at  least 216 countries by June 20, 2020. It was declared as a global pandemic by the  World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. With the rapidly increasing  number of positive cases and deaths, there is a dire need for effective  treatment. An urgent unmet need led to the planning and opening of multiple drug  development trials for treatment and vaccine development. In this article, we  have compiled comprehensive data on many candidate drugs such as remdesivir,  favipiravir, ribavirin, umifenovir, arbidol, lopinavir, ritonavir, baricitinib,  hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, azithromycin, baloxavir, oseltamivir, losartan,  and tocilizumab. We have tabulated available data on various clinical trials  testing various aspects of COVID-19 therapeutics.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Specific inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly-emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is  a very promising strategy for developing highly potent medicines for coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, almost all of the reported viral RdRp  inhibitors (either repurposed drugs or new antiviral agents) lack selectivity  against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Herein, I discovered a new favipiravir derivative,  (E)-N-(4-cyanobenzylidene)-6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide  (cyanorona-20), as the first potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor with very high  selectivity (209- and 45-fold more potent than favipiravir and remdesivir,  respectively). Based on the significant reduction in the in vitro SARS-CoV-2  replication/copies, strong computational cyanorona-20 ligand-RdRp protein  interactions, and anti-RdRp activity of the parent favipiravir drug, SARS-CoV-2  inhibition is thought to be mediated through the coronaviral-2 RdRp inhibition.  This promising selective anti-COVID-19 compound is also, to the best of our  knowledge, the first bioactive derivative of favipiravir, the known antiinfluenza  and antiviral drug. This new nucleoside analog was designed, synthesized,  characterized, computationally studied (through pharmacokinetic calculations  along with computational molecular modeling and prediction), and biologically  evaluated for its anti-COVID-19 activities (through a validated in vitro  anti-COVID-19 assay). The results of the biological assay showed that  cyanorona-20 surprisingly exhibited very significant anti-COVID-19 activity  (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC(50) = 0.45 μM), and, in addition, it could be also a very  promising lead compound for the design of new anti-COVID-19 agents. Cyanorona-20  is a new favipiravir derivative with promise for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2  infection.

AB  - The deadly pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has paralyzed the  world. Although significant methodological advances have been made in the field  of viral detection/diagnosis with 251 in vitro diagnostic tests receiving  emergency use approval by the US-FDA, little progress has been made in  identifying curative or preventive therapies. This review discusses the current  trends and potential future approaches for developing COVID-19 therapeutics,  including repurposed drugs, vaccine candidates, immune-modulators, convalescent  plasma therapy, and antiviral nanoparticles/nanovaccines/combinatorial  nanotherapeutics to surmount the pandemic viral strain. Many potent therapeutic  candidates emerging via drug-repurposing could significantly reduce the cost and  duration of anti-COVID-19 drug development. Gene/protein-based vaccine candidates  that could elicit both humoral and cell-based immunity would be on the frontlines  to prevent the disease. Many emerging nanotechnology-based interventions will be  critical in the fight against the deadly virus by facilitating early detection  and enabling target oriented multidrug therapeutics. The therapeutic candidates  discussed in this article include remdesivir, dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine,  favilavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, antibody therapeutics like gimsilumab and TJM2,  anti-viral nanoparticles, and nanoparticle-based DNA and mRNA vaccines.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Favipiravir is a promising treatment candidate for managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Warfarin has many drug  interactions, but no interactions with favipiravir have been reported. CASE  SUMMARY: Our patient was taking warfarin for deep vein thrombosis. The  international normalized ratio (INR) was stable (1.65 to 2.0); however, it  increased to 4.63 after administering favipiravir. The patient had no other  factors justifying this change. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Favipiravir and  warfarin might have previously unidentified drug interactions that elevated the  INR. Therefore, INR must be closely monitored when they are concomitantly  administered in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Favipiravir was initially developed as an antiviral drug against influenza and is currently used in clinical trials against severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19). This agent is presumably  involved in RNA chain termination during influenza virus replication, although  the molecular interactions underlying its potential impact on the coronaviruses  including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus  (MERS-CoV) remain unclear. We performed in silico studies to elucidate detailed  molecular interactions between favipiravir and the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV,  MERS-CoV, and influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). As a result,  no interactions between favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (F-RTP), the  active form of favipiravir, and the active sites of RdRps (PB1 proteins) from  influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus were found, yet the agent bound to the tunnel of  the replication genome of PB1 protein leading to the inhibition of replicated RNA  passage. In contrast, F-RTP bound to the active sites of coronavirus RdRp in the  presence of the agent and RdRp. Further, the agent bound to the replicated RNA  terminus in the presence of agent, magnesium ions, nucleotide triphosphate, and  RdRp proteins. These results suggest that favipiravir exhibits distinct  mechanisms of action against influenza virus and various coronaviruses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The process of drug discovery and development is expensive, complex, timeconsuming, and risky. There are different techniques involved in the process  of drug development, including random screening, computational approaches,  molecular manipulation, and serendipitous research. Among these methods, the  computational approach is considered an efficient strategy to accelerate and  economize the drug discovery process. OBJECTIVE: This approach is mainly applied  in various phases of the drug discovery process, including target identification,  target validation, lead identification, and lead optimization. Due to the  increase in the availability of information regarding various biological targets  of different disease states, computational approaches such as molecular docking,  de novo design, molecular similarity calculation, virtual screening,  pharmacophore-based modeling, and pharmacophore mapping have been applied  extensively. METHODS: Various drug molecules can be designed by applying  computational tools to explore the drug candidates for the treatment of  Coronavirus infection. The World Health Organization announced the coronavirus  disease as COVID-19 and declared it a global pandemic on 11 February 2020.  Therefore, it is thought of interest to the scientific community to apply  computational methods to design and optimize the pharmacological properties of  various clinically available and FDA-approved drugs such as remdesivir,  ribavirin, favipiravir, oseltamivir, ritonavir, arbidol, chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine, carfilzomib, baraticinib, prulifloxacin, etc., for effective  treatment of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Further, various survey reports suggest  that extensive studies are carried out by various research communities to find  out the safety and efficacy profile of these drug candidates. CONCLUSION: This  review is focused on the study of various aspects of these drugs related to their  target sites on the virus, binding interactions, physicochemical properties, etc.

AB  - Concern regarding coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks has stayed relevant to global health in the last decades. Emerging COVID-19 infection, caused by the novel  SARS-CoV2, is now a pandemic, bringing a substantial burden to human health.  Interferon (IFN), combined with other antivirals and various treatments, has been  used to treat and prevent MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 infections. We aimed  to assess the clinical efficacy of IFN-based treatments and combinational therapy  with antivirals, corticosteroids, traditional medicine, and other treatments.  Major healthcare databases and grey literature were investigated. A three-stage  screening was utilized, and included studies were checked against the protocol  eligibility criteria. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed,  followed by narrative data synthesis. Fifty-five distinct studies of SARS-CoV2,  MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV were spotted. Our narrative synthesis showed a possible  benefit in the use of IFN. A good quality cohort showed lower CRP levels in  Arbidol (ARB) + IFN group vs. IFN only group. Another study reported a  significantly shorter chest X-ray (CXR) resolution in  IFN-Alfacon-1 + corticosteroid group compared with the corticosteroid only group  in SARS-CoV patients. In a COVID-19 trial, total adverse drug events (ADEs) were  much lower in the Favipiravir (FPV) + IFN-α group compared with the LPV/RTV arm  (P = 0.001). Also, nausea in patients receiving FPV + IFN-α regimen was  significantly lower (P = 0.03). Quantitative analysis of mortality did not show a  conclusive effect for IFN/RBV treatment in six moderately heterogeneous MERS-CoV  studies (log OR = -0.05, 95% CI: (-0.71,0.62), I(2) = 44.71%). A meta-analysis of  three COVID-19 studies did not show a conclusive nor meaningful relation between  receiving IFN and COVID-19 severity (log OR = -0.44, 95% CI: (-1.13,0.25),  I(2) = 31.42%). A lack of high-quality cohorts and controlled trials was  observed. Evidence suggests the potential efficacy of several combination IFN  therapies such as lower ADEs, quicker resolution of CXR, or a decrease in  inflammatory cytokines; Still, these options must possibly be further explored  before being recommended in public guidelines. For all major CoVs, our results  may indicate a lack of a definitive effect of IFN treatment on mortality. We  recommend such therapeutics be administered with extreme caution until further  investigation uncovers high-quality evidence in favor of IFN or combination  therapy with IFN.

TI  - Repositioning HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.
AU  - von Hentig, Nils
T2  - European journal of clinical pharmacology
AB  - AIMS: SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus which is part of the ß-coronavirus family (like SARS 2002 and MERS 2012). The high prevalence of  hospitalization and mortality, in addition to the lack of vaccines and  therapeutics, forces scientists and clinicians around the world to evaluate new  therapeutic options. One strategy is the repositioning of already known drugs,  which were approved drugs for other indications. SUBJECT AND METHOD: SARS-CoV-2  entry inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors seem to be  valuable targets of research. At the beginning of the pandemic, the  ClinicalTrials.gov webpage listed n=479 clinical trials related to the antiviral  treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (01.04.2020, "SARS-CoV-2," "COVID-19," "antivirals,"  "therapy"), of which n=376 are still accessible online in January 2021  (10.01.2021). Taking into account further studies not listed in the CTG webpage,  this narrative review appraises HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA  polymerase inhibitors as promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.  RESULTS: Lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, remdesivir,  tenofovir-disoproxilfumarate, favipriravir, and sofosbuvir are evaluated in  clinical studies worldwide. Study designs show a high variability and results  often are contradictory. Remdesivir is the drug, which is deployed in nearly 70%  of the reviewed clinical trials, followed by lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir,  ribavirine, and sofosbuvir. DISCUSSION: This review discusses the  pharmacological/clinical background and questions the rationale and study design  of clinical trials with already approved HIV protease inhibitors and  nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors which are repositioned during the  SARS-CoV-2 pandemic worldwide. Proposals are made for future study design and  drug repositioning of approved antiretroviral compounds.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has had an indelible effect, with 153,738,171 cases recorded globally as per the World Health Organization's  dashboard. The medical establishment is racing to find repurposed medications  that can be successful against this novel coronavirus due to a shortage of new  drugs to treat the disease. Favipiravir, an antiviral drug originally developed  for influenza, is one of the drugs that has recently received a lot of attention,  particularly in India. Here, we present a case of favipiravir-induced drug fever  in a young adult coronavirus disease 2019 patient.

AB  - The ongoing Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emphasized the urgent need  for antiviral therapeutics. The viral RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) is a  promising target with polymerase inhibitors successfully used for the treatment  of several viral diseases. Here we show that Favipiravir exerts an antiviral  effect as a nucleotide analogue through a combination of chain termination,  slowed RNA synthesis and lethal mutagenesis. The SARS-CoV RdRp complex is at  least 10-fold more active than any other viral RdRp known. It possesses both  unusually high nucleotide incorporation rates and high-error rates allowing  facile insertion of Favipiravir into viral RNA, provoking C-to-U and G-to-A  transitions in the already low cytosine content SARS-CoV-2 genome. The  coronavirus RdRp complex represents an Achilles heel for SARS-CoV, supporting  nucleoside analogues as promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.

T2  - Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
AB  - COVID-19 is a severe infectious disease that has claimed >150,000 lives and infected millions in the United States thus far, especially the elderly  population. Emerging evidence has shown the virus to cause hemorrhagic and  immunologic responses, which impact all organs, including lungs, kidneys, and the  brain, as well as extremities. SARS-CoV-2 also affects patients', families', and  society's mental health at large. There is growing evidence of re-infection in  some patients. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of  SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, its mechanism of infection, diagnostics,  therapeutics, and treatment strategies, while also focusing on less attended  aspects by previous studies, including nutritional support, psychological, and  rehabilitation of the pandemic and its management. We performed a systematic  review of >1,000 articles and included 425 references from online databases,  including, PubMed, Google Scholar, and California Baptist University's library.  COVID-19 patients go through acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm,  acute hypercoagulable state, and autonomic dysfunction, which must be managed by  a multidisciplinary team including nursing, nutrition, and rehabilitation. The  elderly population and those who are suffering from Alzheimer's disease and  dementia related illnesses seem to be at the higher risk. There are 28 vaccines  under development, and new treatment strategies/protocols are being investigated.  The future management for COVID-19 should include B-cell and T-cell immunotherapy  in combination with emerging prophylaxis. The mental health and illness aspect of  COVID-19 are among the most important side effects of this pandemic which  requires a national plan for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised global health  concerns. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the prime component of viral  replication/proliferation machinery and is considered to be a potential drug  target against SARS-CoV-2. The present study investigated the anti-RdRp activity  of phytochemicals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Virtual ligand screening was  carried out to determine the potent compounds against RdRp. Molecular docking and  an MD Simulation study were employed to evaluate the spatial affinity of selected  phytochemicals for the active sites of RdRp. Structural stability of target  compounds was determined using root mean square deviation computational analysis  and drug-like abilities were investigated using ADMET. Bond distances between  ligand and receptor were marked to predict the strength of interaction. Aloe,  azadirachtin, columbin, cirsilineol, nimbiol, nimbocinol and sage exhibited the  highest binding affinities and interacted with active sites of RdRp, surpassing  the ability of chloroquine, lamivudine, favipiravir and remdesivir to target the  same. All the natural metabolites exhibited stable conformation during MD  Simulation of 101 ns at 310 K. Kinetic, potential and electrostatic energy were  observed to be least in the case of natural metabolites in comparison with  synthetic analogues. Deviations and fluctuations were observed to be structurally  least in target phytochemicals. Physiochemical and biological properties of these  compounds further validated their drug-like properties. Non-bonded distance was  found to be short enough to form hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions,  which revealed that these target compounds can strongly bind with RdRp. The study  found potential phytochemicals to disrupt the replication domain of SARS-CoV-2 by  hindering RdRp. We therefore anticipate that the current findings could be  considered as valuable for the development of an efficient preventive/therapeutic  expedient against COVID-19.

AB  - An outbreak of 2019-nCoV infection has spread across the world. No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID-2019. In addition  to the recommended antiviral drugs, such as interferon-ɑ, lopinavir/ritonavir,  ribavirin, and chloroquine phosphate, some clinical trials focusing on virus  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors have been registered and  initiated. Favipiravir, a purine nucleic acid analog and potent RdRp inhibitor  approved for use in influenza, is also considered in several clinical trials.  Herein, we summarized the pharmacokinetic characteristics of favipiravir and  possible drug-drug interactions from the view of drug metabolism. We hope this  will be helpful for the design of clinical trials for favipiravir in COVID-2019,  as data regarding in vitro virus inhibition and efficacy in preclinical animal  studies are still not available.

AB  - Coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has gradually spread worldwide, becoming a major public health event. This situation requires  designing a novel antiviral agent against the SARS-CoV-2; however, this is  time-consuming and the use of repurposed medicines may be promising. One such  medicine is favipiravir, primarily introduced as an anti-influenza agent in east  world. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  favipiravir in comparison with lopinavir-ritonavir in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In  this randomized clinical trial, 62 patients were recruited. These patients had  bilateral pulmonary infiltration with peripheral oxygen saturation lower than  93%. The median time from symptoms onset to intervention initiation was seven  days. Favipiravir was not available in the Iranian pharmaceutical market, and it  was decided to formulate it at the research laboratory of School of Pharmacy,  Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. The patients  received favipiravir tablet at a dose of 1600 mg orally twice a day for day one  and then 600 mg orally twice a day for days 2 to 6. In the second group, the  patients received lopinavir-ritonavir combination tablet at a dose of 200/50 mg  twice a day for seven days. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were improved significantly  in favipiravir group in comparison with lopinavir-ritonavir group on days four  and five. Mortality rate and ICU stay in both groups were similar, and there was  no significant difference in this regard (P = 0.463 and P = 0.286, respectively).  Chest X-ray improvement also was not significantly different between the two  groups. Adverse drug reactions occurred in both groups, and impaired liver  enzymes were the most frequent adverse effect. In conclusion, early  administration of oral favipiravir may reduce the duration of clinical signs and  symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and hospitalization period. The mortality rate  also should be investigated in future clinical trials.

AB  - The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December 2019, resulting in the coronavirus disease-19  (COVID-19) pandemic. Coronaviruses are solely accountable for rising mortality  and socioeconomic saddles. Presently, there are few repurposed drugs such as  remdesivir or favipiravir approved for the treatment of COVID-19, although  vaccines and plasma therapy is also subject to emergency approval. However, some  potential natural treatments and cures have also been proposed. Molecules of  natural origin showed therapeutic importance such as antiviral,  anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity, and could be useful drug candidates  for treating COVID-19. In recent years, essential oils have shown promising  therapeutic effects against many viral diseases. Carvacrol is one of the  monoterpene phenol with abundant presence in essential oils of many aromatic  plants, including thyme and oregano. It is being used as food flavoring,  additive, and preservatives. Carvacrol is also used as a fragrance in cosmetic  products. A number of research studies have shown biological actions of carvacrol  with its therapeutic potential is of clinical significance. The in vitro and in  vivo studies have shown multiple pharmacological properties such as anticancer,  anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasorelaxant,  hepatoprotective, and spasmolytic. This review highlights the various biological  and pharmacological properties of carvacrol within the scope of COVID-19.

AB  - The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has presented unprecedented  challenges to the healthcare systems in almost every country around the world.  Currently, there are no proven effective vaccines or therapeutic agents against  the virus. Current clinical management includes infection prevention and control  measures and supportive care including supplemental oxygen and mechanical  ventilatory support. Evolving research and clinical data regarding the virologic  SARS-CoV-2 suggest a potential list of repurposed drugs with appropriate  pharmacological effects and therapeutic efficacies in treating COVID-19 patients.  In this review, we will update and summarize the most common and plausible drugs  for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. These drugs and therapeutic agents  include antiviral agents (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir,  umifenovir, favipiravir, and oseltamivir), and supporting agents (Ascorbic acid,  Azithromycin, Corticosteroids, Nitric oxide, IL-6 antagonists), among others. We  hope that this review will provide useful and most updated therapeutic drugs to  prevent, control, and treat COVID-19 patients until the approval of vaccines and  specific drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Antiviral therapies are integral in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 (i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the causative agent of COVID-19.  Antiviral therapeutics can be divided into categories based on how they combat  the virus, including viral entry into the host cell, viral replication, protein  trafficking, post-translational processing, and immune response regulation. Drugs  that target how the virus enters the cell include: Evusheld, REGEN-COV,  bamlanivimab and etesevimab, bebtelovimab, sotrovimab, Arbidol, nitazoxanide, and  chloroquine. Drugs that prevent the virus from replicating include: Paxlovid,  remdesivir, molnupiravir, favipiravir, ribavirin, and Kaletra. Drugs that  interfere with protein trafficking and post-translational processing include  nitazoxanide and ivermectin. Lastly, drugs that target immune response regulation  include interferons and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as dexamethasone.  Antiviral therapies offer an alternative solution for those unable or unwilling  to be vaccinated and are a vital weapon in the battle against the global  pandemic. Learning more about these therapies helps raise awareness in the  general population about the options available to them with respect to aiding in  the reduction of the severity of COVID-19 infection. In this 'A Guide To'  article, we provide an in-depth insight into the development of antiviral  therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and their ability to help fight COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel strain that causes acute respiratory illnesses known as coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is limited information regarding the  therapeutic management for this disease. Several studies have stated that  antivirals drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir may  potentially inhibit the virus from spreading to the host. OBJECTIVE: The aim of  this systematic review was to summarize the clinical effectiveness and safety of  remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir on COVID-19. METHODS: The PubMed  and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to July 2021 to identify eligible  experimental randomized controlled trials on remdesivir, favipiravir, and  lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19 patients. This systematic review followed the  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)  guideline. RESULTS: From 158 references, 15 studies were included in the review.  The results showed that remdesivir has some potential benefits for hospitalized  COVID-19 patients, as seen from clinical improvements such as faster recovery  time, less duration of hospitalization, and fewer respiratory side effects among  COVID-19 patients. However, the impact of remdesivir in reducing mortality  remains uncertain. Treatment with favipiravir has shown promising improvement in  the clinical status of COVID-19 patients, although the results suggested no  significant differences in some clinical parameters such as length of  hospitalizations and clinical recovery. A combination of favipiravir with other  supportive therapy showed more favorable outcomes for COVID-19 patients.  Furthermore, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients reported no  significant clinical improvement compared to standard care with notable adverse  effect reactions. CONCLUSION: This study provides an overview of the  evidence-based role of remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in the  management of COVID-19. A thorough assessment of the benefit-risk profile in  COVID-19 patients is urgently needed. The current review was based on very  limited available data; therefore, further well-designed clinical trials are  required.

AB  - AIM: To identify investigated interventions for COVID-19 prevention or treatment via trial registry entries on planned or ongoing randomised clinical trials. To  assess these registry entries for recruitment status, planned trial size,  blinding and reporting of mortality. METHODS: We identified trial registry  entries systematically via the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry  Platform and 33 trial registries up to June 23, 2020. We included relevant trial  registry entries for randomized clinical trials investigating medical preventive,  adjunct or supportive therapies and therapeutics for treatment of COVID-19.  Studies with non-random and single-arm design were excluded. Trial registry  entries were screened by two authors independently and data were systematically  extracted. RESULTS: We included 1303 trial registry entries from 71 countries  investigating 381 different single interventions. Blinding was planned in 47% of  trials. Sample size was >200 participants in 40% of trials and a total of 611,364  participants were planned for inclusion. Mortality was listed as an outcome in  57% of trials. Recruitment was ongoing in 54% of trials and completed in 8%.  Thirty-five percent were multicenter trials. The five most frequent  investigational categories were immune modulating drugs (266 trials (20%)),  unconventional medicine (167 trials (13%)), antimalarial drugs (118 trials (9%)),  antiviral drugs (100 trials (8%)) and respiratory adjuncts (78 trials (6%)). The  five most frequently tested uni-modal interventions were:  chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (113 trials with 199,841 participants);  convalescent plasma (64 trials with 11,840 participants); stem cells (51 trials  with 3,370 participants); tocilizumab (19 trials with 4,139 participants) and  favipiravir (19 trials with 3,210 participants). CONCLUSION: An extraordinary  number of randomized clinical trials investigating COVID-19 management have been  initiated with a multitude of medical preventive, adjunctive and treatment  modalities. Blinding will be used in only 47% of trials, which may have influence  on future reported treatment effects. Fifty-seven percent of all trials will  assess mortality as an outcome facilitating future meta-analyses.

AB  - Momordica dioica have proven medicinal potential of antidiabetic, antiviral and immune stimulating properties. Flavonoids and triterpenoids from M. dioica were  more extensively investigated for antiviral, antidiabetic and immunomodulatory  activities. In this present study, we have predicted the reported bioactive  flavonoids and triterpenoids of the plant against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease,  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike protein, angiotensin converting enzyme  (ACE-2) receptor and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4) receptor through molecular  docking and in silico ADME predictions methods. According to the binding  affinities, the two triterpenoids, hederagenin and oleanolic acid exhibited the  best docking scores with these proteins than the catechin and quercetin with  compared to standard remdesivir, favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. The in vitro  protein-drug studies have also showed significant interaction of catechin and  quercetin compounds than standard drugs. The in silico binding studies correlated  with the in silico binding studies. Further, M. dioica being used as antidiabetic  and its metabolite had significant interaction with DDP4, a comorbidity protein  involved in aiding the viral entry. Out of all the natural ligands, quercetin was  reported relatively good and safe for humans with high gastrointestinal tract  permeability and poor blood brain barrier crossing abilities. Hence, M. dioica  phytocompounds reflects promising therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2  infections under comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and  kidney disorders.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - A female nurse in her 40s caring for a patient with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia treated with a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) presented  with fever, cough and dyspnoea. Based on imaging findings and a positive reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed, although  her cohabiting family had similar symptoms and their RT-PCR tests were negative.  Laboratory results showed Mycoplasma antigen (+). She was started on ciclesonide  1200 μg/day and favipiravir (3600 mg/day on the first day and 1600 mg/day from  Day 2). As Mycoplasma antigen was positive on admission and her family had  similar symptoms, levofloxacin 500 mg/day was started. The patient recovered and  was discharged on Day 10. The patient did not have Mycoplasma infection because  the Mycoplasma antibody measured by particle agglutination (PA) method was  increased only up to 80 times after 4 weeks. This case highlights that healthcare  workers wearing full personal protective equipment can nevertheless acquire  COVID-19 from patients treated with HFNCs.

AB  - 1,4-Pyrazine-3-carboxamide-based antiviral compounds have been under intensive study for the last 20 years. One of these compounds, favipiravir  (6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide, T-705), is approved for use against  the influenza infection in a number of countries. Now, favipiravir is being  actively used against COVID-19. This review describes the in vivo metabolism of  favipiravir, the mechanism of its antiviral activity, clinical findings, toxic  properties, and the chemical synthesis routes for its production. We provide data  on the synthesis and antiviral activity of structural analogs of favipiravir,  including nucleosides and nucleotides based on them.

AB  - We report a case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) triggered by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. A 77-year-old man experienced left-sided chest  pain and shortness of breath. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)  revealed a positive result, and he was treated with favipiravir, ciclesonide, and  lascufloxacin, but he showed poor improvement. On the other hand, computed  tomography (CT) images were atypical for COVID-19 infection, and the elevation of  eosinophil was found in blood and the fluid obtained by bronchoscopy. So, we  clinically diagnosed this case as AEP. Administration of prednisolone  dramatically improved the patient's clinical condition and chest radiograph  findings, which were consistent with the clinical course of AEP. This case  suggests the importance of considering the complications of AEP when treating  patients with COVID-19 infection.

AB  - There are concerns regarding the risk and the course of COVID-19 in pregnancy and in the neonates. In this review, we aimed to present the current understanding of  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during  pregnancy and neonatal periods considering diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and  prevention. Few studies on pregnant women with COVID-19 have been conducted  between December 2019 and April 2020. The majority of patients applied in the  third trimester and presented with fever and cough. Ground-glass opacities and  consolidation on computed tomography were reported to be common. COVID-19 was  proposed to have a milder course than SARS and the Middle East respiratory  syndrome coronavirus in pregnant women. Hydroxychloroquine and antiproteases  (lopinavir/ritonavir) were reported to be safe; however, therapeutic efficacy and  safety of remdesivir still lack evidence. As ribavirin and favipiravir have  teratogenic effects, there are some debates on the use of ribavirin in severe  cases. There is still no clear evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2  during delivery. Occupational safety issues of pregnant healthcare workers on the  frontline should be considered as their risk to develop severe pneumonia is  higher because of altered maternal immune response. Knowledge about neonatal  outcomes of COVID-19 was based on studies of the last trimester of pregnancy.  There is much to be learnt about COVID-19 in pregnant women and in the neonates,  especially concerning prognosis- and treatment-related issues.

AU  - Di Perri, Giovanni
T2  - Le infezioni in medicina
AB  - In spite of many ongoing attempts to repurpose existing antivirals, no drugs have emerged yet with the desirable activity against SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine,  lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, umifenovir, favipiravir, ribavirin and  beta-interferon-1 gave rise to variable but still inconsistent proof of clinical  efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. Pathogenetic studies have shown  significant differences between commonly defined viral pneumonia and COVID-19  pulmonary disease. In severe forms, immune/inflammatory alterations reminiscent  of disease forms like Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) have been described,  and therapeutic options other than anti-infective have been proposed and  implemented, such as anti-inflammatory and anticoagulative agents. The thrombotic  phenomena described in the pulmonary vascular bed of patients with severe  COVID-19 suggest the administration of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as  standard measure in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

AB  - In this minireview we describe our work on the improvement of the nucleobase analogs Favipiravir (T-705) und its non-fluorinated derivative T-1105 as  influenza and SARS-CoV-2 active compounds. Both nucleobases were converted into  nucleotides and then included in our nucleotide prodrugs technologies  cycloSal-monophosphates, DiPPro-nucleoside diphosphates and TriPPPro-nucleoside  triphosphates. Particularly the DiPPro-derivatives of T-1105-RDP proved to be  very active against influenza viruses. T-1105-derivatives in general were found  to be more antivirally active as compared to their T-705 counterpart. This may be  due to the low chemical stability of all ribosylated derivatives of T-705. The  ribosyltriphosphate derivative of T-1105 was studied for the potential to act as  a inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and was found to be an extremely potent  compound causing lethal mutagenesis. The pronucleotide technologies, the chemical  synthesis, the biophysical properties and the biological effects of the compounds  will be addressed as well.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the persistence of viral RNA in clinically recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) have been  reported as potential molecular viability markers for severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, few data are available on their  longitudinal kinetics, compared with genomic RNA (gRNA), in clinical samples.  METHODS: We analyzed 536 samples from 205 patients with COVID-19 from  placebo-controlled, outpatient trials of peginterferon Lambda-1a (Lambda;  n = 177) and favipiravir (n = 359). Nasal swabs were collected at 3 time points  in the Lambda (days 1, 4, and 6) and favipiravir (days 1, 5, and 10) trials.  N-gene gRNA and sgRNA were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription  polymerase chain reaction. To investigate the decay kinetics in vitro, we  measured gRNA and sgRNA in A549(ACE2+) cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, following  treatment with remdesivir or dimethylsulfoxide control. RESULTS: At 6 days in the  Lambda trial and 10 days in the favipiravir trial, sgRNA remained detectable in  51.6% (32/62) and 49.5% (51/106) of the samples, respectively. Cycle threshold  (Ct) values for gRNA and sgRNA were highly linearly correlated (marginal R (2) =  0.83), and the rate of increase did not differ significantly in the Lambda trial  (1.36 cycles/d vs 1.36 cycles/d; P = .97) or the favipiravir trial (1.03 cycles/d  vs 0.94 cycles/d; P = .26). From samples collected 15-21 days after symptom  onset, sgRNA was detectable in 48.1% (40/83) of participants. In  SARS-CoV-2-infected A549(ACE2+) cells treated with remdesivir, the rate of Ct  increase did not differ between gRNA and sgRNA. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical samples  and in vitro, sgRNA was highly correlated with gRNA and did not demonstrate  different decay patterns to support its application as a viability marker.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  originated in China and spread to cover the entire world with an ongoing  pandemic. The magnitude of the situation and the fast spread of the new and  deadly virus, as well as the lack of specific treatment, led to a focus on  research to discover new therapeutic agents. AIM: In this study, we explore the  potential inhibitory effects of some active polyphenolic constituents of Rhus  spp. (sumac) against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme (M(pro); 6LU7). METHODS:  26 active polyphenolic compounds of Rhus spp. were studied for their antiviral  activity by molecular docking, drug likeness, and synthetic accessibility score  (SAS) as inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). RESULTS: The results show that  all tested compounds of sumac provided good interaction with the main active site  of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), with better, lower molecular docking energy (kcal/mol)  compared to the well-known drugs chloroquine and favipiravir (Avigan). Only six  active polyphenolic compounds of Rhus spp. (sumac), methyl  3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate,  (Z)-1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxyprop-2-en-1-one,  (Z)-2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)-6-hydroxybenzofuran-3(2H)-one,  3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chroman-4-one,  2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-4H-chroman-4-one, and  3,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chroman-4-one, were proposed by drug likeness,  solubility in water, and SAS analysis as potential inhibitors of M(pro) that may  be used for the treatment of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Six phenolic compounds of Rhus  spp. are proposed for synthesis as potential inhibitors against M(pro) and have  potential for the treatment of COVID-19. These results encourage further in vitro  and in vivo investigations of the proposed ligands and research on the preventive  use of Rhus spp. against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an acute onset pneumonia caused by a novel Betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),  emerged in the Wuhan City of China in December 2019 and evolved into a global  pandemic. To date, there are no proven drugs or vaccines against this virus.  Hence, the situation demands an urgent need to explore all potential therapeutic  strategies that can be made available to prevent the disease progression and  improve patient outcomes. In absence of clinically proven treatment guidelines,  several repurposed drugs and investigational agents are currently being evaluated  in clinical trials for their probable benefits in the treatment of COVID-19.  These include antivirals (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir, and  favipiravir), interferon, antimalarials (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine),  antiparasitic drugs (ivermectin and nitazoxanide), biologics (monoclonal  antibodies and interleukin receptor antagonist), cellular therapies (mesenchymal  stem cells and natural killer cells), convalescent plasma, and cytokine adsorber.  Though several observational studies have claimed many of these agents to be  effective based on their in vitro activities and extrapolated evidence from SARS  and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics, the currently available  data remains inconclusive because of ill-defined patient selection criteria,  small sample size, lack of concurrent controls, and use of intermediary outcomes  instead of patient-relevant outcomes. Moreover, there is a need to clearly define  the patient populations who warrant therapy and also the timing of initiation of  treatment. Understanding the disease pathology responsible for the clinical  manifestations of COVID-19 is imperative to identify the potential targets for  drug development. This review explains the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and  summarizes the potential treatment candidates, which can provide guidance in  developing effective therapeutic strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Favipiravir is used to treat influenza, and studies demonstrate that it has antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We performed a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase  2 proof-of-concept trial of favipiravir in hospitalized adult patients with  polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  Patients were randomized to standard of care (SOC) or favipiravir treatment  (1800mg per os twice a day [b.i.d.] on day 1, followed by 1000mg b.i.d. for 13  days). The primary end point was time to viral clearance on day 29. RESULTS:  Fifty patients were enrolled and stratified by disease severity (critical  disease, severe disease, or mild to moderate disease). Nineteen patients were  censored from the event of viral clearance based on being SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative  at the study outset, being PCR-positive at day 29, or because of loss to  follow-up. Data from the 31 remaining patients who achieved viral clearance show  enhanced viral clearance in the favipiravir group compared with the SOC group by  day 29, with 72% of the favipiravir group and 52% of the SOC group being  evaluable for viral clearance through day 29. The median time to viral clearance  was 16.0 days (90% CI, 12.0 to 29.0) in the favipiravir group and 30.0 days (90%  CI, 12.0 to 31.0) in the SOC group. A post hoc analysis revealed an effect in the  subgroup of patients who were neutralizing antibody-negative at randomization.  Treatment-emergent adverse events were equally distributed between the groups.  CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that favipiravir can be safely administered to  hospitalized adults with COVID-19 and believe that further studies are warranted.

AB  - The emergence or re-emergence of viruses with epidemic and/or pandemic potential, such as Ebola, Zika, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute  Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 and 2 (SARS and SARS-CoV-2) viruses, or new  strains of influenza represents significant human health threats due to the  absence of available treatments. Vaccines represent a key answer to control these  viruses. However, in the case of a public health emergency, vaccine development,  safety, and partial efficacy concerns may hinder their prompt deployment. Thus,  developing broad-spectrum antiviral molecules for a fast response is essential to  face an outbreak crisis as well as for bioweapon countermeasures. So far,  broad-spectrum antivirals include two main categories: the family of drugs  targeting the host-cell machinery essential for virus infection and replication,  and the family of drugs directly targeting viruses. Among the molecules directly  targeting viruses, nucleoside analogues form an essential class of broad-spectrum  antiviral drugs. In this review, we will discuss the interest for broad-spectrum  antiviral strategies and their limitations, with an emphasis on virus-targeted,  broad-spectrum, antiviral nucleoside analogues and their mechanisms of action.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an enveloped, single-stranded  RNA virus. Favipiravir is an orally administrable antiviral drug whose mechanism  of action is to selectively inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A preliminary  trial in COVID-19 patients reported significant improvements across a multitude  of clinical parameters, but these findings have not been confirmed in an adequate  well-controlled trial. We conducted a randomized, single-blind,  placebo-controlled Phase III trial assessing the efficacy and safety of  favipiravir in patients with moderate pneumonia not requiring oxygen therapy.  METHODS: COVID-19 patients with moderate pneumonia (SpO(2) ≥ 94%) within 10 days  of onset of fever (temperature ≥ 37.5 °C) were assigned to receive either placebo  or favipiravir (1800 mg twice a day on Day 1, followed by 800 mg twice a day for  up to 13 days) in a ratio of 1:2. An adaptive design was used to re-estimate the  sample size. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome defined as the time to  improvement in temperature, oxygen saturation levels (SpO(2)), and findings on  chest imaging, and recovery to SARS-CoV-2-negative. This endpoint was re-examined  by the Central Committee under blinded conditions. RESULTS: A total of 156  patients were randomized. The median time of the primary endpoint was 11.9 days  in the favipiravir group and 14.7 days in the placebo group, with a significant  difference (p = 0.0136). Favipiravir-treated patients with known risk factors  such as obesity or coexisting conditions provided better effects. Furthermore,  patients with early-onset in the favipiravir group showed higher odds ratio. No  deaths were documented. Although adverse events in the favipiravir group were  predominantly transient, the incidence was significantly higher. CONCLUSIONS: The  results suggested favipiravir may be one of options for moderate COVID-19  pneumonia treatment. However, the risk of adverse events, including  hyperuricemia, should be carefully considered. TRIAL REGISTRATION:  Clinicaltrials.jp number: JapicCTI-205238.

AB  - Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) mainly affects young children and immunocompromised patients, causing morbidity and mortality in a subset of  patients. Since no specific treatment is available, this study aims to explore  the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents including favipiravir and remdesivir for treating  HCoV-NL63 infection. We first successfully modelled the 3D structure of HCoV-NL63  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) based on the experimentally solved SARS-CoV-2  RdRp structure. Molecular docking indicated that favipiravir has similar binding  affinities to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 RdRp with LibDock scores of 75 and 74,  respectively. The LibDock scores of remdesivir to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 were  135 and 151, suggesting that remdesivir may have a higher affinity to HCoV-NL63  compared to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In cell culture models infected with HCoV-NL63, both  favipiravir and remdesivir significantly inhibited viral replication and  production of infectious viruses. Overall, remdesivir compared to favipiravir is  more potent in inhibiting HCoV-NL63 in cell culture. Importantly, there is no  evidence of resistance development upon long-term exposure to remdesivir.  Furthermore, combining favipiravir or remdesivir with the clinically used  antiviral cytokine interferon-alpha resulted in synergistic effects. These  findings provided a proof-of-concept that anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, in particular  remdesivir, have the potential to be repurposed for treating HCoV-NL63 infection.

AB  - In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered.  Since its emergence, COVID-19 has been outbreaking rapidly worldwide, where the  virus has so far caused the death of hundreds of thousands and infected more than  a million, what has been called a pandemic by the World Health Organization  (WHO). According to the WHO-Coronavirus disease 2019 Situation Report-142, by  June 10, 2020, there are 7,145,539 confirmed cases and 408,025 deaths. There is  an urgent need to develop a suitable specific medicine against this novel  coronavirus; therefore, scientists and researchers around the world are making  great efforts endeavoring to discover an efficient specific medication for  COVID-19 treatment. Given the similarity of the novel coronavirus with previous  epidemic viruses, namely, the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), previously  tested drugs could potentially work against the novel coronavirus. In this  narrative review, we aim to summarize and discuss the effectiveness of current  Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine options for COVID-19 treatment  based on the overview of the scientific literature. Some Western medicines  including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir,  lopinavir/ritonavir, and arbidol, as well as some traditional Chinese medicine  (TCM) such as Qingfei Paidu decoction, Yupingfeng, Lianhua Qingwen, and TCM  injections have revealed a relative activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, in  observational studies, and in clinical trials. However, further extensive studies  and clinical trials including double-blind and randomized clinical trials, with a  higher number of patients, are necessary to confirm the activity of these  medicines. There are several ongoing trials conducted on the drugs of COVID-19,  and the results are urgently needed to make a suitable treatment recommendation.

AB  - AIM: We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, in particular older patients, admitted to  tertiary and partner hospitals in Saitama, Japan. METHODS: We retrospectively  reviewed the medical records of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to  tertiary and partner hospitals in Saitama, Japan. Twenty-six patients with  COVID-19 were categorized into two groups, i.e., older (≥75 years) and younger  adults (≤74 years). We evaluated the clinical characteristics, comorbidities,  symptoms, laboratory test results, treatments and outcomes of the patients.  RESULTS: The majority of the older patients had comorbidities, such as dementia,  cardiovascular disease and bone fractures. Comorbidities were significantly more  frequent in older patients than younger patients. No association was found  between age and body temperature or the incidence of respiratory failure. White  blood cell count was significantly lower in older patients (P = 0.018) and the  decrease in lymphocytes was greater in younger patients (P = 0.009). Computed  tomography (CT) of all patients showed non-segmental, peripherally dominant  ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. In older patients,  antiviral drugs, anticoagulants and anti-inflammatory drugs were administered on  a compassionate use basis. The difference in mortality between the older and the  younger patients was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In older  patients, typical clinical symptoms and blood test changes were often absent;  however, CT always contained typical findings of COVID-19, suggesting that CT may  be a useful diagnostic tool. Our report illustrates that appropriate treatment,  taking patient background into consideration, may improve their condition  regardless of age. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; 20: 1044-1049.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of favipiravir for patients with  mild-to-critical COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Embase,  and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for RCTs  published before 30 October 2021. Only RCTs that compared the clinical efficacy  and safety of favipiravir -based antiviral regimens (study group) with other  alternative treatments or placebos (control group) in patients with COVID-19 were  included. RESULTS: Overall, the clinical improvement rate was significantly  higher in the study group than in the control group at the assessment conducted  after 14 days (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.12-2.98). The rate of virological eradication  was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group at the  assessment conducted after 28 days (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.15-3.78). No significant  difference was observed in the rates of invasive mechanical ventilation  requirement or ICU admission, mortality, or risk of an adverse event between the  study and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Except the clinical improvement rate  within 14 days and the virological eradication rate within 28 days,  favipiravir-based treatment did not provide significantly additional benefit for  patients with COVID-19. Therefore, more evidence is necessary.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to compare the intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate of hospitalized mild/moderate COVID-19 patients treated with  hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), favipiravir, and HCQ plus favipiravir. METHODS: Single  center retrospective designed observational study conducted in Ankara City  Hospital. Patients who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020 and June 1, 2020  in COVID-19 inpatient clinics with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19  were included in the study. An inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)  for multiple treatment groups approach was used to balance the differences in  several variables on admission. RESULTS: Among 2441 patients hospitalized with  diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period, 824 were eligible for the  analysis. Median age of patients was 42 (18-93 years). Among all, 347 (43.2%) of  the patients had mild disease, 470 (56.8%) had pneumonia. Propensity scores  ranged from 0.1841 to 0.9381 in the HCQ group, from 0.03643 to 0.29885 in the  favipiravir group, and from 0.03542 to 0.56184 in the HCQ plus favipiravir group.  After IPTW for multiple treatment groups was applied, all the covariates in the  planned propensity score had weighted standardized effect sizes below 10% which  were ranged from 0.005 to 0.092. Multivariate analysis of treatment effect  (adjusted effect of treatment) was indicated that there is no statistically  significant difference between HCQ, favipiravir, and HCQ plus favipiravir  treatment. After using combination of SMOTE and Bootstrap resampling approach, we  found no statistically significant difference between HCQ and HCQ plus  favipiravir groups in terms of ICU admission. However, compared with the HCQ  group, ICU admission rate was statistically significantly higher in the  favipiravir group. We obtained the similar results after the sensitivity  analysis. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ with or without favipiravir treatment is associated  with reduced risk of ICU admission compared to favipiravir alone in mild to  moderate COVID-19 adult patients.

AB  - Multiple options are being tried for the management of 2019-nCoV infection since its pandemic started. Favipiravir (FPV) is one of drugs, which is also being  tried for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The present study aimed to  evaluate the efficacy and safety of FPV in published literature. Comparative  randomized or nonrandomized controlled clinical trials comparing FPV to the  standard of care (SOC)/control or other antiviral agent/combinations were  included. A total of 12 databases were searched and identify four studies which  were further used for final analysis. The data analysis was done as pooled  prevalence using a random effect model by "RevMan manager version 5.4.1 and "R"  software. The point estimate, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI)  was calculated for dichotomous data. In the present study, the marginal  beneficial effect was seen in the FPV group in overall clinical improvement  comparison to SOC/control, i.e., (4 studies, log OR [95% CI] (-0.19 [-0.51,  0.13]). However, in all other outcomes, it was found to be comparable to the  SOC/control arm namely "clinical improvement on day 7-10" (3 studies, OR [95% CI]  1.63 [1.07, 2.48]) while "clinical improvement on day 10-14" (3 studies, OR [95%  CI] 1.37 [0.24, 7.82]) and viral negativity was seen (4 studies, OR [95% CI] 1.91  [0.91, 4.01]). No difference in efficacy was found between FPV versus  lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol groups. Regarding adverse effects, except for the  occurrence of rash (higher in the FPV group), safety was comparable to SOC. In  our study, there was a marginal difference between the FPV and the SOC arm in  terms of "clinical improvement" on day 7-10 or 10-14, and "virological  negativity" on day 10-14." However, some benefit was observed in a few studies,  but it was also comparable to the control drugs or SOC.

AB  - Smart implementation of novel advanced nanocarriers such as functionalized C(24) and B(12)N(12) nanocages is used supplement for antiviral activity  5-Fluoro-2-hydroxypyrazine-3-carboxamide (Favipiravir; Avigan; T-705), as  treatment of COVID-19. The interaction energies of Favipiravir with perfect  (B(12)N(12) and C(24)) and doped (BC(23) and CB(11)N(12)) nanocages were studied  at temperatures equal to 310.15 K and 298.15 K using DFT. Our results have shown  that the interaction of the Favipiravir (C[bond, double bond]O group) with BC(23)  and CB(11)N(12) is more favorable than with the C(24) and B(12)N(12) nanocages in  the gas and aqueous environments. Additionally, the natural bond orbital, the  highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular  orbital (LUMO), energy gap, chemical reactivity, molecular electrostatic  potential, and thermodynamic parameters of the optimized structure have been  examined. Furthermore, the UV-Vis and infrared spectroscopy have been evaluated  for the investigation of the molecular orbitals Participated in the absorption  spectrum of the Favipiravir before and after the interaction with the C(24),  BC(23), B(12)N(12,) and CB(11)N(12), sites at maximum wavelength utilizing the  time-dependent density functional theory (TD-B3LYP and TD-CAM-B3LYP). The  intermolecular interactions have been analyzed by non-covalent interactions (NCI)  and also, the electron localization function (ELF) is discussed.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a serious threat to global  public health and economies. Currently, hundreds of clinical trials on a wide  variety of treatments against COVID-19 are being conducted around the world.  Here, we conducted a search for ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of  COVID-19 at the clinicaltrials.gov database on April 2, 2020. In total, 48  clinical trials were identified, and of these, 41 trials adopted drug  intervention and the other 7 trials utilized biological intervention. The number  of trials stratified by a chief country conducting the investigation were 18 in  China, 5 in the United States, 4 in Canada, 3 in Italy, 2 in France and Brazil,  and 4 trials are being performed multinationally. The drugs utilized in more than  one trials were remdesivir (6 trials), lopinavir/ritonavir (6 trials),  hydroxychloroquine (6 trials), interferon (5 trials), methylprednisolone (3  trials), nitric oxide gas (3 trials), oseltamivir (2 trials), arbidol (2 trials),  and vitamin C (2 trials). We also described the Japanese trials which are now  being conducted or scheduled, utilizing lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir,  favipiravir, ciclesonide and nafamostat.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). Currently, the management of patients with  COVID-19 depends mainly on repurposed drugs which include chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir,  umifenovir, interferon-α, interferon-β and others. In this review, the potential  of Nigella sativa (black cumin seeds) to treat the patients with COVID-19  analyzed, as it has shown to possess antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,  anticoagulant, immunomodulatory, bronchodilatory, antihistaminic, antitussive,  antipyretic and analgesic activities. PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct,  Directory of open access journals (DOAJ) and reference lists were searched to  identify articles associated with antiviral and other properties of N.sativa  related to the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Various randomized controlled  trials, pilot studies, case reports and in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed  that N.sativa has antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory,  bronchodilatory, antihistaminic, antitussive activities related to causative  oraganism and signs and symptoms of COVID-19. N. sativa could be used as an  adjuvant therapy along with repurposed conventional drugs to manage the patients  with COVID-19.

AB  - Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has exploded and led to a global crisis. Currently, the global case  numbers topped 200 million, and toll of dead exceeded 4 million around the world.  The pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is driven by two  processes. During the first stage of the infection that lasts around 5-7 days,  replication of SARS-CoV-2 occurs. In the second stage, the disease may progress  due to an exaggerated inflammatory response leading to tissue damage. Therefore,  it is anticipated that antiviral agents would be effective during the early phase  of the disease, while immunomodulator agents are likely to be more beneficial in  the second stage of COVID-19. This basic concept of disease development led to  explore several antiviral and immunomodulator agents for the treatment of  COVID-19. Currently, remdesivir is the only available Food and Drug  Administration-approved antiviral agent for the treatment of COVID-19. However,  some other agents have been approved by various mechanisms, including Emergency  Use Authorizations, Emergency Investigational New Drug applications,  compassionate use or expanded access programs. In addition, a variety of  repurposed agents that were approved for other indications are being investigated  for the treatment of COVID19 in clinical trials. A myriad of publications  including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are emerging continuously and are  accessible as peer-reviewed, pre-print and press release formats. Considering the  critical importance of RCTs in generating evidence and providing further guidance  on COVID-19 treatment, we herein reviewed only RCTs and meta-analyses. The  discussion includes antiviral agents (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir,  remdesivir, favipiravir and ivermectin) and, various immunomodulatory drugs  (corticosteroids, tocilizumab, baricitinib, and IL-1 inhibitors). Other  investigational therapies including darunavir/cobicistat, umifenovir,  sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, sofobuvir/ledipasvir, ribavirin, nitazoxanide and  interferon-based regimens were not evaluated due to insufficient data on the  efficacy and safety of these agents.

AB  - The severe respiratory disease COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. Soon thereafter, the World  Health Organization (WHO) officially declared it a pandemic. The adult population  is highly affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  (SARS-CoV-2); however, infants and children are also not spared. Transmission in  the pediatric population appears to be primarily from COVID-19-positive adults,  largely from family contacts through droplets, direct contacts, and aerosols.  There is also evidence of fecal-oral route of transmission. The incubation period  of COVID-19 in children ranges from 2 to 10 days. Most children are asymptomatic.  The most common symptoms amongst symptomatic children are fever and cough.  Shortness of breath, sore throat, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, fatigue, and  headache are other common symptoms. Diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are  the common gastrointestinal symptoms that may be present with or without  respiratory symptoms. Very few children are likely to develop severe  disease.Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment. Though data are limited,  antiviral therapies such as remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and  other drugs like hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine have been used for severe  COVID-19 cases, with remdesivir showing the greatest promise. A few children may  develop an exaggerated immune response, characterized by exaggerated cytokine  release and manifests with features similar to Kawasaki disease. The syndrome has  been referred to by many names including pediatric inflammatory multisystem  syndrome (PIMS) and more recently, as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C); this life-threatening condition often requires a  multidisciplinary team effort and use of immunomodulators.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the seventh-generation coronavirus family causing viral pandemic coronavirus disease  (COVID-19) across globe affecting millions of people. The objectives of this  study are to (1) identify the major research themes in COVID-19 literature, (2)  determine the origin, symptoms and modes of transmission of COVID, (3) recommend  the intervention and mitigation strategies adopted by the Governments globally  against the spread of COVID-19 and the traumatization among the public? and (4)  study the possible drugs/treatment plans against COVID-19. A systematic  literature review and comprehensive analysis of 38 research articles on COVID-19  are conducted. An integrated Research focus parallel-ship network and keyword  co-occurrence analysis are carried out to visualize the three research concepts  in COVID-19 literature. Some of our observations include: (1) as SARS-CoV-2's RNA  matches ~ 96% to SARS-CoV, it is assumed to be transmitted from the bats. (2) The  common symptoms are high fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness  of breath, diarrhoea etc. (3) A lockdown across 180 affected counties for more  than a month with social-distancing and the precautions taken in SARS and MERS  are recommended by the Governments. (4) Researchers' claim that nutrition and  immunity enhancers and treatment plans such as arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir,  convalescent plasma and mesenchymal stem cells and drugs including remdesivir,  hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and favipiravir are effective against COVID-19.  This complied report serves as guide to help the administrators, researchers and  the medical officers to adopt recommended intervention strategies and the optimal  treatment/drug against COVID-19.

AB  - This prospective observational study describes the pharmacokinetic characteristics of favipiravir in adult patients hospitalized for mild to  moderate COVID-19 with a positive RT-PCR test. Favipiravir was administered for  5 days, with a loading dose of 3200 mg and a maintenance dose of 1200 mg/day.  Serial blood samples were collected on Day 2 and Day 4 of the therapy. Laboratory  findings of the patients (n = 21) and in-hospital mortality were recorded.  Favipiravir concentrations exhibited substantial variability and a significant  decrease during the treatment of COVID-19. The median favipiravir trough  concentration (C(0-trough) ) on Day 2 was 21.26 (interquartile range [IQR],  8.37-30.78) μg/mL, whereas it decreased significantly to 1.61 (IQR,  0.00-6.41) μg/mL on Day 4, the area under the concentration-time curve decreased  by 68.5%. Day 2 C(0-trough) of female patients was higher than male patients. Our  findings indicate that favipiravir concentrations show significant variability  during the treatment of COVID-19 and therapeutic drug monitoring may be necessary  to maintain targeted concentrations.

AB  - Solid-organ transplant patients have a high risk of severe infection related to acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2). This case represents a  54-year-old woman known as a diabetic, hypothyroidism, and a recent heart  transplant recipient who presented with a 1-week history of cough and fatigue.  She was hypoxic on presentation to the hospital and progressively declined and  required invasive mechanical ventilation. She had respiratory distress and  hypoxia and chest x-ray showed progressive bilateral chest infiltrates. She had  leukopenia of 3.5 cells *10(9)/L and lymphopenia of 0.2 cells *10(9)/L. The  inflammatory markers were increased: C-reactive protein, 25 mg/L; ferritin, 1106  ng/mL; lactate dehydrogenase, 632 U/L; and interleukin-6, 87 pg/mL. She was  treated for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Her treatment  involved supportive care with mechanical ventilation, convalescent plasma  transfusion, antiviral therapy with favipiravir, intravenous dexamethasone, and  reduction of immune suppression medication. This case had a successful recovery  through multidisciplinary team management. Solid-organ transplant recipients are  a high-risk population who need an individualized care plan for the optimization  of immunosuppressive medication and treatment of the COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Comparison of HPLC and UV Spectrophotometric Methods for Quantification of Favipiravir in Pharmaceutical Formulations.
AU  - Bulduk, İbrahim
T2  - Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR
AB  - There is no currently successful method to treat Covid-19 infection. Nevertheless, previously licensed pharmaceuticals to treat other virus infections  are used on an off-label basis either alone or in combination. One of them is  favipiravir. Favipiravir, also known as favilavir, is an antiviral drug that is  active against many viruses. Spectrophotometric and liquid chromatographic  methods have been developed and validated for the quantitative determination of  favipiravir in pharmaceutical formulations. Chromatographic method has been  performed using reverse-phase technique on a C-18 column with a mobile phase  consisting of sodium acetate solution (pH adjusted to 3.0 with glacial acetic  acid) and acetonitrile (85:15, v/v) at 30 (o)C. The mobile phase flow rate was  1.0 mL min(-1). For the determination of favipiravir, UV spectrum has been  recorded between 200 and 800 nm using deionized water as solvent and the  wavelength of 227 nm has been selected. Both methods have been validated in terms  of their specificity, linearity, limits of detection and quantification,  precision, accuracy, and robustness. Both methods have demonstrated good  linearity, precision and recovery. No spectral and chromatographic interferences  from the tablet excipients were found in spectrophotometric and liquid  chromatographic methods. In both methods, correlation coefficients were greater  than 0.999 within a concentration range of 10-60 mg mL-(1) using  spectrophotometry and chromatography. Intra-day and inter-day precision were  observed with low relative standard deviation values. The accuracy of the methods  were within the range 99.57-100.10% for LC and from 99.83-100.45% for UV.  Therefore, both methods gave the most reliable outcomes for the determination of  favipiravir in pharmaceutical formulation.

T2  - Journal of neonatal nursing : JNN
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neonates appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults, yet COVID-19 has been a challenge for all medical specialties, including neonatal  intensive care unit (NICU) specialists. Unfortunately, current knowledge about  the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is  limited. This case report explains how COVID-19 neonatal sepsis was treated with  immunomodulatory agents. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case, we present a premature  male newborn who was ill. He was born to a mother with a negative nasopharyngeal  swab test for SARS-CoV-2. On the fifth day of life, the baby developed  respiratory distress, and a nasopharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2 tested  positive. The baby was Intubated, and intratracheal surfactant was administered.  The infant was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and corticosteroids  for 14 days. PATIENT'S DEMOGRAPHICS: Age: under 1 month, Sex: Male, Ethnicity:  Iranian. CONCLUSION: The basics of treatment for neonatal COVID-19 is supportive  care. Some studies have treated infants with various drugs such as  Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir, and Remedsivir; however, in our case, a  5-day-old baby boy was treated with corticosteroids and IVIg. We achieved good  outcomes after 2 weeks of treatment with dexamethasone 0.3 mg/kg per day and IVIg  2 g/kg/day (for 3 days). It appears that these treatments, along with adjuvant  ventilation and the administration of endotracheal surfactant, can improve a  patient's general condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the safety and efficacy of a treatment protocol containing Favipiravir for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We did a  multicenter randomized open-labeled clinical trial on moderate to severe cases  infections of SARS-CoV-2. Patients with typical ground glass appearance on chest  computerized tomography scan (CT scan) and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) of less  than 93% were enrolled. They were randomly allocated into Favipiravir (1.6 gr  loading, 1.8 gr daily) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (800/200 mg daily) treatment  regimens in addition to standard care. In-hospital mortality, ICU admission,  intubation, time to clinical recovery, changes in daily SpO(2) after 5 min  discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, and length of hospital stay were  quantified and compared in the two groups. RESULTS: 380 patients were randomly  allocated into Favipiravir (193) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (187) groups in 13  centers. The number of deaths, intubations, and ICU admissions were not  significantly different (26, 27, 31 and 21, 17, 25 respectively). Mean hospital  stay was also not different (7.9 days [SD = 6] in the Favipiravir and 8.1  [SD = 6.5] days in Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups) (p = 0.61). Time to clinical  recovery in the Favipiravir group was similar to Lopinavir/Ritonavir group  (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 - 1.17) and likewise the changes in the daily SpO(2)  after discontinuation of supplemental oxygen (p = 0.46) CONCLUSION: Adding  Favipiravir to the treatment protocol did not reduce the number of ICU admissions  or intubations or In-hospital mortality compared to Lopinavir/Ritonavir regimen.  It also did not shorten time to clinical recovery and length of hospital stay.

AB  - There is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes has been named coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 16% of patients developed acute respiratory  distress syndrome, and the fatality ratio was 1%-2%. No specific treatment has  been reported. Herein, we examined the effects of favipiravir (FPV) versus  lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) for the treatment of COVID-19. Patients with  laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600 mg twice daily;  Days 2-14: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon (IFN)-α by aerosol inhalation (5  million international unit (IU) twice daily) were included in the FPV arm of this  study, whereas patients who were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1-14: 400 mg/100 mg  twice daily) plus IFN-α by aerosol inhalation (5 million IU twice daily) were  included in the control arm. Changes in chest computed tomography (CT), viral  clearance, and drug safety were compared between the two groups. For the 35  patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all  baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. A shorter viral  clearance median time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (4 d  (interquartile range (IQR): 2.5-9) versus 11 d (IQR: 8-13), P < 0.001). The FPV  arm also showed significant improvement in chest CT compared with the control  arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P = 0.004). After  adjustment for potential confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly  higher improvement rate in chest CT. Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV  was independently associated with faster viral clearance. In addition, fewer  adverse events were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm. In this  open-label before-after controlled study, FPV showed better therapeutic responses  on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance. These  preliminary clinical results provide useful information of treatments for  SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),  has spread worldwide since early 2020, and there are still no signs of  resolution. The Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of  Sepsis and Septic Shock (J-SSCG) 2020 Special Committee created the Japanese  Rapid/Living recommendations on drug management for COVID-19 using the experience  of creating the J-SSCG. METHODS: The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment,  Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to determine the certainty  of the evidence and strength of recommendations. The first edition of this  guideline was released on September 9, 2020, and this is the revised edition  (version 5.0; released on July 15, 2022). Clinical questions (CQs) were set for  the following 10 drugs: favipiravir (CQ1), remdesivir (CQ2), corticosteroids  (CQ4), tocilizumab (CQ5), anticoagulants (CQ7), baricitinib (CQ8),  casirivimab/imdevimab (CQ9-1), sotrovimab (CQ9-2), molnupiravir (CQ10), and  nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (CQ11). RECOMMENDATIONS: Favipiravir is not suggested for  all patients with COVID-19 (GRADE 2C). Remdesivir is suggested for patients with  mild COVID-19 who do not require oxygen, and patients with moderate COVID-19  requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (both GRADE 2B). Corticosteroids  are recommended for moderate and severe COVID-19 (GRADE 1B, 1A). However, their  administration is not recommended for mild COVID-19 (GRADE 1B). Tocilizumab is  suggested for moderate and severe COVID-19 (GRADE 2B, 2C). Anticoagulant  administration is recommended for moderate and severe COVID-19 (Good Practice  Statement). Baricitinib is suggested for moderate and severe COVID-19 (both GRADE  2C). Casirivimab/imdevimab and sotrovimab are recommended for mild COVID-19 (both  GRADE 2C). Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are recommended for mild  COVID-19 (both GRADE 2C). SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains emerge occasionally, and each  time, the treatment policy at clinics is forced to change drastically. We ask  health-care professionals in the field to refer to the recommendations in these  guidelines and use these to keep up to date with COVID-19 epidemiological  information.

AB  - Transporters in the human liver play a major role in the clearance of endo- and xenobiotics. Apical (canalicular) transporters extrude compounds to the bile,  while basolateral hepatocyte transporters promote the uptake of, or expel,  various compounds from/into the venous blood stream. In the present work we have  examined the in vitro interactions of some key repurposed drugs advocated to  treat COVID-19 (lopinavir, ritonavir, ivermectin, remdesivir and favipiravir),  with the key drug transporters of hepatocytes. These transporters included  ABCB11/BSEP, ABCC2/MRP2, and SLC47A1/MATE1 in the canalicular membrane, as well  as ABCC3/MRP3, ABCC4/MRP4, SLC22A1/OCT1, SLCO1B1/OATP1B1, SLCO1B3/OATP1B3, and  SLC10A1/NTCP, residing in the basolateral membrane. Lopinavir and ritonavir in  low micromolar concentrations inhibited BSEP and MATE1 exporters, as well as  OATP1B1/1B3 uptake transporters. Ritonavir had a similar inhibitory pattern, also  inhibiting OCT1. Remdesivir strongly inhibited MRP4, OATP1B1/1B3, MATE1 and OCT1.  Favipiravir had no significant effect on any of these transporters. Since both  general drug metabolism and drug-induced liver toxicity are strongly dependent on  the functioning of these transporters, the various interactions reported here may  have important clinical relevance in the drug treatment of this viral disease and  the existing co-morbidities.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: An outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has occurred in different parts of the world. Although a large piece of information regarding the  epidemiology, clinical features, and management of COVID-19 has been reported in  the general population, there is very limited data regarding organ transplant  recipients, particularly regarding the management of maintenance  immunosuppressive agents during infection. METHODOLOGY: We described a case of  kidney transplant recipient from Thailand who had COVID-19 pneumonia and severe  acute kidney injury. RESULTS: The patient's serum creatinine peaked at 7.0 mg/dL  on day 15 of illness and returned to baseline value of 2.0 mg/dL on day 26 of  illness. We have shown how we modified tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and steroids in  the patient who had received favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19  pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, successful modification of this  immunosuppressive regimen was accomplished to reduce drug interaction  complications, aiming to avoid calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity while  maintaining appropriate levels of immunosuppression to prevent organ rejection  and to promote the patient's recovery from infection.

AB  - A 72-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital for treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and was started on favipiravir, heparin calcium, and  methylprednisolone pulse therapy. He recovered from respiratory failure about one  month later. However, he soon developed purpura in his lower limbs and  thrombocytopenia, and immune thrombocytopenia was subsequently diagnosed.  Although immune thrombocytopenia is one of the early complications of COVID-19,  the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 is thought to be a factor in the late  onset of immune thrombocytopenia. In cases of severe COVID-19 for which  corticosteroids were used for treatment, autoimmune diseases such as immune  thrombocytopenia may manifest themselves late in the disease course.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis which has affected citizens of all nations. With more than a million death cases, this outbreak has already had a  significant impact on the physical and mental wellbeing of mankind. Considerable  amount of research is going on worldwide to find out effective drugs against the  virus. Chloroquine phosphate, an antimalarial drug is currently used for the  treatment. Studies on the harmful effects of chloroquine is in progress. India is  rich in traditional medical practicing such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani etc.  Ministry of AYUSH is trying to implement an interdisciplinary treatment  encompassing all traditional methodologies. It is proven that Ashwagandha  rasayana (Withania sominefera L.Dunal) has better functions than  hydroxychloroquine. The ayurvedic formulations such as Sudarshan Ghanvati and  Sanshamanivati are also used. The combination of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and  azithromycin is found to cure COVID-19 more effectively. Use of Tocilizumab is  found to cure the respiratory disorders associated with COVID. Favilavir turns  out to be yet another effective drug. The alternative medical system has  effective prophylaxis and is considered better for the treatment of COVID-19.  Ayurveda and yoga improve immunity thus maintaining good health. This review  throws light on the mode of progression of the virus along with the various  treatment protocols adopted to fight COVID-19.

AB  - Favipiravir (brand name Avigan), a widely known anti-influenza prodrug, is metabolized by endogenous enzymes of host cells to generate the active form,  which exerts inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity; first,  favipiravir is converted to its phosphoribosylated form,  favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5'-monophosphate (favipiravir-RMP), by  hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). Because this  phosphoribosylation reaction is the rate-determining step in the generation of  the active metabolite, quantitative and real-time monitoring of the  HGPRT-catalyzed reaction is essential to understanding the pharmacokinetics of  favipiravir. However, assay methods enabling such monitoring have not been  established. (19) F- or (31) P-based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are  powerful techniques for observation of intermolecular interactions, chemical  reactions, and metabolism of molecules of interest, given that NMR signals of the  heteronuclei sensitively reflect changes in the chemical environment of these  moieties. Here, we demonstrated direct, sensitive, target-selective,  nondestructive, and real-time observation of HGPRT-catalyzed conversion of  favipiravir to favipiravir-RMP by performing time-lapse (19) F-NMR monitoring of  the fluorine atom of favipiravir. In addition, we showed that (31) P-NMR can be  used for real-time observation of the identical reaction by monitoring phosphorus  atoms of the phosphoribosyl group of favipiravir-RMP and of the pyrophosphate  product of that reaction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NMR approaches permit  the determination of general parameters of enzymatic activity such as V(max) and  K(m) . This method not only can be widely employed in enzyme assays, but also may  be of use in the screening and development of new favipiravir-analog antiviral  prodrugs that can be phosphoribosylated more efficiently by HGPRT, which would  increase the intracellular concentration of the drug's active form. The  techniques demonstrated in this study would allow more detailed investigation of  the pharmacokinetics of fluorinated drugs, and might significantly contribute to  opening new avenues for widespread pharmaceutical studies.

AB  - Despite high morbidity and mortality of ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, no specific therapy has been established till date. Though  in vitro studies identified various molecules as possible therapies against  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), these findings call  for substantiation by human studies. We conducted this review aiming at reporting  evidences on therapies used so far globally for management of COVID-19 in  clinical settings. We searched electronic databases as PubMed, Google Scholar,  EMBASE and extracted 612 possible studies as on May 31, 2020. We included  original studies of any epidemiological design done on human COVID-19 patients  and measured clinical outcomes. Finally, following removal of duplicates and  studies meeting exclusion criteria, we derived 22 studies, of which eight were  clinical trials, seven were case reports and case series, and seven were  observational studies. The most reported therapies were hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)  (eight studies) and lopinavir/ritonavir (four studies). We conclude from the  evidence generated so far that interferon combined with antivirals, remdesivir,  umifenovir and favipiravir were mostly associated with better clinical outcomes.  The therapeutic effect of HCQ was established initially by two clinical trials;  one of them showing a reinforcing effect by azithromycin but subsequent studies  did not elicit any effectiveness rather increased rate of adverse events was  reported. Lopinavir/ritonavir was found beneficial when administered with  interferon and ribavirin, but one clinical trial on its sole use proved contrary.  As many clinical trials are in process, we expect to get concrete evidences on  repurposing of existing drugs based on less biased, high powered studies.

AB  - By 9 February 2021, the Coronavirus has killed 2,336,650 people worldwide and it has been predicted that this number continues to increase in year 2021. The study  aimed to identify therapeutic approaches and drugs that can potentially be used  as interventions in Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) management. A systematic scoping  review was conducted. Articles reporting clinical evidence of therapeutic  management of COVID-19 were selected from three different research databases  (Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct). From the database search, 31  articles were selected based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. This  review paper showed that remdesivir and ivermectin significantly reduced viral  ribonucleic acid (RNA) activity. On the other hand, convalescent plasma (CP)  significantly improved COVID-19 clinical symptoms. Additionally, the use of  corticosteroid increased survival rates in COVID-19 patients with acute  respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Findings also indicated that both  hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir were effective against severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, lopinavir-ritonavir  combination was not effective against COVID-19. Finally, ribavirin, galidesivir,  and sofosbuvir showed potential therapeutic benefit in treating COVID-19, but  there is a lack of clinical evidence on their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2.  Remdesivir, ivermectin, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone,  methylprednisolone, and CP are the therapeutic agents that can potentially be  used in COVID-19 management.

AB  - The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has developed into an unprecedented global pandemic. Nucleoside analogs, such as  Remdesivir and Favipiravir, can serve as the first-line broad-spectrum antiviral  drugs by targeting the viral polymerases. However, the underlying mechanisms for  the antiviral efficacies of these drugs are far from well understood. Here, we  reveal that Favipiravir, as a pyrazine derivative, could be incorporated into the  viral RNA products by mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides. This drug  thus inhibits viral replication mainly by inducing mutations in progeny RNAs,  different from Remdesivir or other RNA-terminating nucleoside analogs that impair  the elongation of RNA products. We further determined the cryo-EM structure of  Favipiravir bound to the replicating polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 in the  pre-catalytic state. This structure provides a missing snapshot for visualizing  the catalysis dynamics of coronavirus polymerase, and reveals an unexpected  base-pairing pattern between Favipiravir and pyrimidine residues that may explain  its capacity for mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides. These findings  shed light on the mechanism of coronavirus polymerase catalysis and provide a  rational basis for developing antiviral drugs to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

AB  - At present, over 180 million people have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide and there have been  more than 3.8 million deaths due to the virus. However, specific effective  antiviral treatment for this infectious disease is absent. At the beginning of  the epidemic, relevant cellular and animal experiments of antiviral treatment for  SARS-CoV-2 were conducted based on the prior studies of SARS-CoV and Middle East  respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Some antivirals were preliminarily validated to  be potentially effective in the clinical settings. But as the epidemic continued  and more studies were carried out, the efficacy of these antiviral drugs became  controversial. This paper reviews the pharmacology and application of interferon,  lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine, arbidol, favipiravir, remdesivir,  and thymosin α1 in coronavirus disease 2019. The actual effect of these drugs  remains controversial. Meanwhile, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for  patients with coronavirus disease 2019 still need to be explored.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and invade the human cells to  cause COVID-19-related pneumonia. Despite an emphasis on respiratory  complications, the evidence of neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2  infection is rapidly growing, which is substantially contributing to morbidity  and mortality. The neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may have  several pathophysiological underpinnings, which are yet to be explored.  Hypothetically, SARS-CoV-2 may affect the central nervous system (CNS) either by  direct mechanisms like neuronal retrograde dissemination and hematogenous  dissemination, or via indirect pathways. CNS complications associated with  COVID-19 include encephalitis, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, diffuse  leukoencephalopathy, stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic), venous sinus  thrombosis, meningitis, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. These may result from  different mechanisms, including direct virus infection of the CNS, virus-induced  hyper-inflammatory states, and post-infection immune responses. On the other  hand, the Guillain-Barre syndrome, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and myopathy are the  outcomes of peripheral nervous system injury. Although the therapeutic potential  of certain repurposed drugs has led to their off-label use against COVID-19, such  as anti-retroviral drugs (remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir-ritonavir  combination), biologics (tocilizumab), antibiotics (azithromycin), antiparasitics  (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), and corticosteroids (dexamethasone),  unfortunately, the associated clinical neuropsychiatric adverse events remains a  critical issue. Therefore, COVID-19 represents a major threat to the field of  neuropsychiatry, as both the virus and the potential therapies may induce  neurologic as well as psychiatric disorders. Notably, potential COVID-19  medications may also interact with the medications of pre-existing  neuropsychiatric diseases, thereby further complicating the condition. From this  perspective, this review will discuss the possible neurological manifestations  and sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection with emphasis on the probable underlying  neurotropic mechanisms. Additionally, we will highlight the concurrence of  COVID-19 treatment-associated neuropsychiatric events and possible clinically  relevant drug interactions, to provide a useful framework and help researchers,  especially the neurologists in understanding the neurologic facets of the ongoing  pandemic to control the morbidity and mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) has infected millions of people and  caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. However, until now there has  not been found a specific drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This prompted many  researchers to explore compounds as anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates. One of the  efforts to deal with the spread of the COVID-19 virus is to increase the body's  immune system (immune). Medicinal plants known to have the ability as  immune-modulators, one of which is Betel leaf (Piper betle L.) those reported to  have good activity as antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-viral, and other  pharmacological effects. An in silico approach in drug development was used to  search for potential antiviral compounds as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro  Protein, RBD, and Non-structural Protein (NSP15). OBJECTIVE: This study was to  determine the potential of Betel leaf compounds as immune-modulators and good  inhibitory pathways against COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, a potential  screening of steroid class compounds, namely 24-propilcholesterol was carried out  as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidate, using an in silico approach with molecular  docking simulations for three receptors that play an important role in COVID-19,  namely Mpro SARS-CoV-2, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and non-structural protein (NSP15) and  compared with Azithromycin, Favipiravir and Ritonavir as positive control.  RESULTS: Based on the results of molecular docking simulations compound from  Betel leaf, 24-Propylcholesterol, showed high binding affinity values for spike  glycoprotein RBD and non-structural protein 15 (NSP15), namely -7.5 and -7.8  kcal/mol. Meanwhile, a native ligand of Mpro, inhibitor N3, has a higher binding  affinity value than 24-propylcholesterol -7.4 kcal/mol. CONCLUSION:  24-Propylcholesterol compound predicted to have potential as an anti-SARS-CoV-2  compound. However, it is necessary to carry out in vitro and in vivo studies to  determine the effectiveness of the compound as an anti-SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, caused an international outbreak of a respiratory illness, termed COVID-19 in December 2019. There is a  lack of specific therapeutic agents based on evidence for this novel coronavirus  infection; however, several medications have been evaluated as a potential  therapy. Therapy is required to treat symptomatic patients and decrease the virus  carriage duration to limit the communitytransmission. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We  hypothesise that patients with mild COVID-19 treated with favipiravir will have a  shorter duration of time to virus clearance than the control group. The primary  outcome is to evaluate the effect of favipiravir on the timing of the PCR test  conversion from positive to negative within 15 days after starting the  medicine.Adults (>18 years, men or nonpregnant women, diagnosed with mild  COVID-19 within 5 days of disease onset) are being recruited by physicians  participating from the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs and the Ministry  of Health ethics committee approved primary healthcare centres. This  double-blind, randomised trial comprises three significant parts: screening,  treatment and a follow-up period. The treating physician and patients are  blinded. Eligible participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the  therapy group (favipiravir) or a control group (placebo) with 1800 mg by mouth  two times per day for the first day, followed by 800 mg two times per day for  4-7 days. Serial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples are obtained on day 1  (5 days before therapy). On day5±1 day, 10±1 day, 15±2 days, extra  nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR COVID-19 samples are requested.The primary  analysis population for evaluating both the efficacy and safety outcomes will be  a modified intention to treat population. Anticipating a 10% dropout rate, we  expect to recruit 288 subjects per arm. The results assume that the hazard ratio  is constant throughout the study and that the Cox proportional hazard regression  is used to analyse the data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by  the King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre Institutional Review  Board (28 April 2020) and the Ministry of Health Institutional Review Board (1  July 2020). Protocol details and any amendments will be reported to  https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04464408. The results will be published in  peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: National Clinical Trial  Registry (NCT04464408).

AB  - The rapid breakout of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared pandemic with serious global concern due to high morbidity and  mortality. As we enter the phase beyond limitations there is an urgent need for  explicit treatment against COVID-19. To face this immediate global challenge,  drug development from scratch is a lengthy process and unrealistic to conquer  this battle. Drug repurposing is an emerging and practical approach where  existing drugs, safe for humans, are redeployed to fight this harder to treat  disease. A number of multi clinical studies have repurposed combined cocktail  (remdesivir + chloroquine and favipiravir + chloroquine) to be effective against  COVID-19. However, the exact mechanistic aspect has not yet been revealed. In the  present study, we have tried to decipher the mechanistic aspects of existing  medicines at the viral entry and replication stage via the structural  viroinformatics approach. Here we implied the molecular docking and dynamic  simulations with emphasis on the unique structural properties of host receptor  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV2 spike protein and RNA dependent  RNA polymerase enzyme (RdRp) of the SARS-CoV2. Deep structural analysis of target  molecules exposed key binding residues and structural twists involved in binding  with important pharmacophore features of existing drugs  [(7-chloro-N-[5-(diethylamino)pentan-2-yl]quinolin-4-amine  (chloroquine),N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide  N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide)  (SSAA09E2), 2-ethylbutyl  (2S)-2-{[(S)-{[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-{4-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl}-5-cyano-3  (remdesivir) and 6-Fluor-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2-pyrazincarboxamid (favipiravir)]. It  is evident from this structural informatics study that combo of  chloroquine + SSAA09E2 with remdesivir or favipiravir could significantly  restrain the virus at the entry and replication stage. Thus, drug repurposition  is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost to treat COVID-19, we don't  have enough time as the whole world is lockdown and we are in urgent need of an  obvious therapeutics' measures.

AB  - Összefoglaló. A koronavírus-19-pandémia hatalmas kihívás az egészségügyi ellátórendszerek számára. A hatékony kezelés iránti igény felerősítette a  terápiás megoldásokra való törekvéseket. Ennek egyik eleme a favipiravir  hatóanyag széles körű ambuláns és intézeti alkalmazása. A gyógyszer biztonsági  információi korlátozottan említik a lehetséges cardialis mellékhatásokat:  mindösszesen az igen ritka mellékhatások között lelhető fel a "szívritmuszavar"  megjegyzés. A közlemény a favipiravirkezeléshez köthető átmeneti sinusbradycardia  esetét ismerteti. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(7): 267-270. Summary. The coronavirus  pandemic is an enormously high challenge for medical health services worldwide.  The demand for effective treatment amplified the pursuits for therapeutic  solutions. One element of the possible treatment is the use of favipiravir in  outpatient departments and hospitals. Safety information of favipiravir is  limited with the risk of potential cardiac side effects: only the two words of  "rhytm disturbances" can be found among the very rare side effects. This article  describes the case of favipiravir-induced transient sinus bradycardia. Orv Hetil.  2022; 163(7): 267-270.

AB  - The coronaviruses have caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the more recent coronavirus  pneumonia (COVID-19). The global COVID-19 pandemic requires urgent action to  develop anti-virals, new therapeutics, and vaccines. In this review, we discuss  potential therapeutics including human recombinant ACE2 soluble, inflammatory  cytokine inhibitors, and direct anti-viral agents such as remdesivir and  favipiravir, to limit their fatality. We also discuss the structure of the  SARS-CoV-2, which is crucial to the timely development of therapeutics, and  previous attempts to generate vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Finally, we  provide an overview of the role of nanotechnology in the development of  therapeutics as well as in the diagnosis of the infection. This information is  key for computational modeling and nanomedicine-based new therapeutics by  counteracting the variable proteins in the virus. Further, we also try to  effectively share the latest information about many different aspects of COVID-19  vaccine developments and possible management to further scientific endeavors.

AB  - Drug-induced angioedema often affects elderly patients with chronic drug use. Proper diagnosis and prompt with effective treatment reduce mortality. With the  increasing use of favipiravir, many side effects, especially increased alanine  aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels due to liver  toxicity, and also skin lesions are reported. First patient oral favipiravir  treatment on the second day was admitted to the hospital with rash and swelling  on the eyelids. Second patient suffered from significant swelling on the upper  lip and displayed angioedema. In this cases, angioedema findings regressed after  rapid diagnosis and parenterally administered antihistamine and steroid  treatment. Although there is no effective drug therapy in the treatment of  COVID-19, favipiravir is also included in the treatment protocols in many  countries. Clinicians should be careful about the side effects and possible skin  manifestations, especially including angioedema, related to the use of  favipiravir.

AB  - Favipiravir is a potential antiviral medication that has been recently licensed for Covid-19 treatment. In this work, a gadolinium-based magnetic ionic liquid  was prepared and used as an extractant in dispersive liquid-liquid  microextraction (DLLME) of favipiravir in human plasma. The high enriching  ability of DLLME allowed the determination of favipiravir in real samples using  HPLC/UV with sufficient sensitivity. The effects of several variables on  extraction efficiency were investigated, including type of extractant, amount of  extractant, type of disperser and disperser volume. The maximum enrichment was  attained using 50 mg of the Gd-magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) and 150 μl of  tetrahydrofuran. The Gd-based MIL could form a supramolecular assembly in the  presence of tetrahydrofuran, which enhanced the extraction efficiency of  favipiravir. The developed method was validated according to US Food and Drug  Administration bioanalytical method validation guidelines. The coefficient of  determination was 0.9999, for a linear concentration range of 25 to 1.0 × 10(5)  ng/ml. The percentage recovery (accuracy) varied from 99.83 to 104.2%, with RSD  values (precision) ranging from 4.07 to 11.84%. The total extraction time was  about 12 min and the HPLC analysis time was 5 min. The method was simple,  selective and sensitive for the determination of favipiravir in real human  plasma.

T2  - Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - The rise of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases worldwide has driven the need to discover and develop novel therapeutics with superior efficacy to treat this  disease. This study aims to develop an innovative aerosolized nano-formulation of  favipiravir (FPV) as an anti-viral agent against coronavirus infection. The local  delivery of FPV nanoparticles (NPs) via nebulization ensures that the drug can  reach the site of infection, the lungs. Solid lipid NPs of favipiravir (FPV-SLNs)  were formulated utilizing the hot-evaporation method. The physicochemical  formulation properties were evaluated using dynamic light scattering (DLS),  Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and differential scanning  calorimetry (DSC). The aerosol formulation performance was evaluated using an  Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI) at a flow rate of 15 L/min. The FPV-SLN  formulation's in vitro anti-viral activity against severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was also evaluated using the SARS-CoV-2  pathogen (hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-3/2020 isolate). The FPV-SLNs' morphology was defined  utilizing transmission electron microscopy, showing an irregular shape. By means  of FPV-SLNs' nebulization, a fine particle fraction of 60.2 ± 1.7% was produced  with 60.2 ± 1.7%, and this finding suggests that FPV-SLNs were appropriate for  inhalation drug delivery with a particle size of 537.6 ± 55.72 nm. Importantly,  the FPV-SLNs showed anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with CC(50) and IC50  values of 449.6 and 29.9 µg/mL, respectively. This study suggests that inhaled  solid lipid NPs of favipiravir could potentially be used against coronavirus.

AB  - Electrochemical analyses aided by density functional theory calculations were used to investigate the oxidative degradation of pyrazine antiviral drugs,  3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (T-1105) and  6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (favipiravir, T-705), by the  electrogenerated superoxide radical anion (O(2) (•-)). T-1105 and T-705 are  antiviral RNA nucleobase analogues that selectively inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase. They are expected as a drug candidate against various viral  infections, including COVID-19. The pyrazine moiety was decomposed by O(2) (•-)  through proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). Our results show that its active  form, pyrazine-ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate, is easily oxidized under inflamed  organs by overproduced O(2) (•-) through the PCET mechanism in the immune system.  This mechanistic study implies that the oxidative degradation of pyrazine  derivatives will be prevented by controlling the PCET through simple modification  of the pyrazine structure.

AB  - Broad-spectrum antiviral therapies hold promise as a first-line defense against emerging viruses by blunting illness severity and spread until vaccines and  virus-specific antivirals are developed. The nucleobase favipiravir, often  discussed as a broad-spectrum inhibitor, was not effective in recent clinical  trials involving patients infected with Ebola virus or SARS-CoV-2. A drawback of  favipiravir use is its rapid clearance before conversion to its active  nucleoside-5'-triphosphate form. In this work, we report a synergistic reduction  of flavivirus (dengue, Zika), orthomyxovirus (influenza A), and coronavirus  (HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) replication when the nucleobases favipiravir or T-1105  were combined with the antimetabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside (6MMPr).  The 6MMPr/T-1105 combination increased the C-U and G-A mutation frequency  compared to treatment with T-1105 or 6MMPr alone. A further analysis revealed  that the 6MMPr/T-1105 co-treatment reduced cellular purine nucleotide  triphosphate synthesis and increased conversion of the antiviral nucleobase to  its nucleoside-5'-monophosphate, -diphosphate, and -triphosphate forms. The 6MMPr  co-treatment specifically increased production of the active antiviral form of  the nucleobases (but not corresponding nucleosides) while also reducing levels of  competing cellular NTPs to produce the synergistic effect. This in-depth work  establishes a foundation for development of small molecules as possible  co-treatments with nucleobases like favipiravir in response to emerging RNA virus  infections.

AB  - Recent efforts to repurpose drugs to combat COVID-19 have identified Remdesivir as a candidate. It acts on the RNA-dependent, RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the  SARS-CoV-2 virus, a protein complex responsible for mediating replication of the  virus's genome. However, its exact action mechanism, and that of other nucleotide  analogue inhibitors, is not known. In this study, we examine at the molecular  level the interaction of this drug and that of similar nucleotide analogue  inhibitors, ribavirin and favilavir, by relying on atomistic molecular  simulations and advanced sampling. By analyzing the binding free energies of  these different drugs, it is found that all of them bind strongly at the active  site. Surprisingly, however, ribavirin and favilavir do not bind the nucleotide  on the complementary strand as effectively and seem to act by a different  mechanism than remdesivir. Remdesivir exhibits similar binding interactions to  the natural base adenine. Moreover, by analyzing remdesivir at downstream  positions of the RNA, we also find that, consistent with a "delayed" termination  mechanism, additional nucleotides can be incorporated after remdesivir is added,  and its highly polar 1'-cyano group induces a set of conformational changes that  can affect the normal RdRp complex function. By analyzing the fluctuations of  residues that are altered by remdesivir binding, and comparing them to those  induced by lethal point mutations, we find a possible secondary mechanism in  which remdesivir destabilizes the protein complex and its interactions with the  RNA strands.

AB  - The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a serious threat to public health worldwide and, to date, no effective treatment is available. Thus, we herein review the  pharmaceutical approaches to SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment. Numerous candidate  medicines that can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication have been  proposed. These medicines include inhibitors of serine protease TMPRSS2 and  angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the  receptor in host cells. ACE2 inhibitors block TMPRSS2 and S protein priming, thus  preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells. Moreover, antiviral medicines  (including the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, the HIV protease inhibitors  lopinavir and ritonavir, and wide-spectrum antiviral antibiotics arbidol and  favipiravir) have been shown to reduce the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 as well as  morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread across the world, and no specific antiviral drugs have yet been approved to combat this disease. Favipiravir (FAV)  is an antiviral drug that is currently in clinical trials for use against  COVID-19. However, the delivery of FAV is challenging because of its limited  solubility, and its formulation is difficult with common organic solvents and  water. To address these issues, four FAV ionic liquids (FAV-ILs) were synthesized  as potent antiviral prodrugs and were fully characterized by nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry,  powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), derivative  thermogravimetry (DTG), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The aqueous  solubility and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of the FAV-ILs were also  evaluated. The FAV-ILs exhibited improved aqueous solubility by 78 to 125 orders  of magnitude when compared with that of free FAV. Upon oral dosing in mice, the  absolute bioavailability of the β-alanine ethyl ester FAV formulation was  increased 1.9-fold compared with that of the control FAV formulation. The peak  blood concentration, elimination half-life, and mean absorption time of FAV were  also increased by 1.5-, 2.0-, and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with the  control. Furthermore, the FAV in the FAV-ILs exhibited significantly different  biodistribution compared with the control FAV formulation. Interestingly, drug  accumulation in the lungs and liver was improved 1.5-fold and 1.3-fold,  respectively, compared with the control FAV formulation. These results indicate  that the use of ILs exhibits potential as a simple, scalable strategy to improve  the solubility and oral absorption of hydrophobic drugs, such as FAV.

T2  - Bulletin of the National Research Centre
AB  - Recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), commonly known as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China and  around the world. By the declaration of WHO, COVID-19 outbreak considered as a  public health problem of international concern. The aim of this study is to  provide a comprehensive view on COVID-19 and the future expectations to control  virus progression. Patients with liver disease, diabetes, high blood pressure,  and obesity are more susceptible to the incidence of COVID-19 infection. So,  there is a rapid need for disease diagnosis, vaccine development, and drug  discovery to detect, prevent, and treat this sudden and lethal virus. Real-time  polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered as a rapid, accurate, and  specific tool for disease diagnosis. Under this emergency situation that the  world facing against COVID-19, there are about 15 potential vaccine candidates  tested globally based on messenger RNA, DNA-based, nanoparticle, synthetic, and  modified virus-like particle. Certain drugs that are clinically approved for  other diseases were tested against COVID-19 as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine,  ivermectin, favipiravir, ribavirin, and remdesivir. Convalescent plasma  transfusion and traditional herbal medicine were also taken into consideration.  Due to the absence of effective treatment or vaccines against COVID-19 so far,  the precautionary measures according to WHO's strategic objectives are the only  way to confront this crisis. Governments should adopt national medical care  programs to reduce the risk of exposure to any future viral outbreaks especially  to patients with pre-existing medical conditions.

T2  - Annals of medicine and surgery (2012)
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thrombocytopaenia, one of the most common haematological disorders worldwide, is characterised by platelet counts <150,000/mm(3). Patients with  coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were found to commonly exhibit haematological  abnormalities, often with mild forms of thrombocytopaenia. Absolute  thrombocytopaenia tends to be rare among these patients and is believed to be  secondary to immune-induced thrombocytopaenia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 53-y-old man  presented with fever and generalised body ache that persisted for a few days. His  polymerase chain reaction test was positive for COVID-19, for which he was  treated with acetaminophen, levofloxacin, and favipiravir. On the third day of  treatment, he noticed bruising and bleeding, mainly in the oral cavity, with clot  formation. A complete blood picture (CBP) revealed severe thrombocytopaenia with  an almost-zero count. Prednisone 1 mg/kg/d and frequent doses of intravenous  platelet transfusion were administered as rescue therapy to prevent fatal  bleeding. The patient was able to recover. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Immune  thrombocytopaenia should be considered in patients presenting with bleeding  tendencies after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.  Serial CBP is recommended for vulnerable patients, especially during the second  and third weeks of hospitalisation, for the early detection and prevention of  life-threatening COVID-19 complications. CONCLUSIONS: Absolute thrombocytopaenia  is a rare condition. Such a condition should be considered in patients presenting  with bleeding tendencies with severe Covid-19 infection. With early diagnosis and  appropriate treatment, patients' lives can be saved.

AB  - This paper is a summary of research that looks at the potential of fullerene-like (MO)(12) nanoclusters (NCs) in drug-carrying systems using density functional  theory. Favipiravir/Zn(12)O(12) (- 34.80 kcal/mol), Favipiravir/Mg(12)O(12)  (- 34.98 kcal/mol), and Favipiravir/Be(12)O(12) (- 30.22 kcal/mol) were rated in  order of drug adsorption degrees. As a result, Favipiravir attachment to  (MgO)(12) and (ZnO)(12) might be simple, increasing Favipiravir loading  efficiency. In addition, the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM)  assessment was utilized to look at the interactions between molecules. The FMO,  ESP, NBO, and E(ads) reactivity patterns were shown to be in excellent agreement  with the QTAIM data. The electrostatic properties of the system with the biggest  positive charge on the M atom and the largest E(ads) were shown to be the best.  This system was shown to be the best attraction site for nucleophilic agents. The  findings show that (MgO)(12) and (ZnO)(12) have great carrier potential and may  be used in medication delivery.

AB  - Favipiravir (FVP) has been used for treatment of COVID-19 in many countries. We analysed the incidence of FVP-induced cutaneous adverse reactions (CARs) in  patients infected with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura  Infectious Diseases Institute, a principal centre of emerging infectious disease  in Thailand, and who presented with cutaneous eruption following FVP  prescription. We identified five cases of FVP-induced CARs: two patients with  maculopapular rash, two with urticarial rash, and one with Stevens-Johnson  syndrome. The median interval between FVP treatment and rash occurrence was  7 days and the mean duration of the rash was 5 days. This report highlights that  FVP can induce CARs, particularly eruptions, in COVID-19-infected patients.  Clinicians should be aware of this possible drug-related allergy, and it should  be excluded as a cause of rash during FVP treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Heart transplantation (HT) has become a standard option for patients with end-stage heart failure (HF). However, the scarcity of donor availability remains  a major hurdle for receiving this novel therapy, especially in the context of the  rapidly spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2;  COVID-19) pandemic. We report the case of a patient in the United Arab Emirates  (UAE) with advanced HF who was glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient and  had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic retinopathy and  nephropathy, chronic kidney disease stage II, and hyperlipidemia. He was referred  for HT abroad and was subsequently caught in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic  in New York, the US state most affected by the crisis at the time. Despite  limited experience with favipiravir, we judged it to be the most appropriate  agent with this patient's complex history given the lower risk for QT  prolongation, no need for renal-dose adjustment, and no reported drug-drug  interactions. Given the limited clinical experience with this agent, particularly  for our patient, we decided to adopt strategies to mitigate and monitor the  potential for QT prolongation. We outline the logistical, clinical, and  pharmacological challenges that the poly-morbid patient and our HT program in the  Middle-East faced under those novel circumstances.

AB  - Remdesivir (GS-5734), a drug initially developed to treat hepatitis C and Ebola virus disease, was the first approved treatment for severe coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19). However, apart from remdesivir, there is a paucity of other  specific anti-viral agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 2017, researchers had  documented the anti-coronavirus potential of remdesivir in animal models. At the  same time, trials performed during two Ebola outbreaks in Africa showed that the  drug was safe. Although vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have emerged at an  enormously high speed, equivalent results from efforts towards the development of  anti-viral drugs, which could have played a truly life-saving role in the current  stage of the pandemic, have been stagnating. In this review, we will focus on the  current treatment options for COVID-19 which mainly consist of repurposed agents  or treatments conferring passive immunity (convalescent plasma or monoclonal  antibodies). Additionally, potential specific anti-viral therapies under  development will be reviewed, such as the decoy miniprotein CTC-445.2d, protease  inhibitors, mainly against the Main protein Mpro, nucleoside analogs, such as  molnupiravir and compounds blocking the replication transcription complex  proteins, such as zotatifin and plitidepsin. These anti-viral agents seem to be  very promising but still require meticulous clinical trial testing in order to  establish their efficacy and safety. The continuous emergence of viral variants  may pose a real challenge to the scientific community towards that end. In this  context, the advent of nanobodies together with the potential administration of a  combination of anti-viral drugs could serve as useful tools in the armamentarium  against COVID-19.

T2  - European heart journal. Acute cardiovascular care
AB  - More than 2,000,000 individuals worldwide have had coronavirus 2019 disease infection (COVID-19), yet there is no effective medical therapy. Multiple  off-label and investigational drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine,  have gained broad interest due to positive pre-clinical data and are currently  used for treatment of COVID-19. However, some of these medications have potential  cardiac adverse effects. This is important because up to one-third of patients  with COVID-19 have cardiac injury, which can further increase the risk of  cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Adverse effects of chloroquine and  hydroxychloroquine on cardiac function and conduction are broad and can be fatal.  Both drugs have an anti-arrhythmic property and are proarrhythmic. The American  Heart Association has listed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as agents which  can cause direct myocardial toxicity. Similarly, other investigational drugs such  as favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir can prolong QT interval and cause Torsade  de Pointes. Many antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of patients with  COVID-19, for instance azithromycin, can also prolong QT interval. This review  summarizes evidenced-based data regarding potential cardiac adverse effects due  to off-label and investigational drugs including chloroquine and  hydroxychloroquine, antiviral therapy, monoclonal antibodies, as well as common  antibiotics used for the treatment of COVID-19. The article focuses on practical  points and offers a point-of-care protocol for providers who are taking care of  patients with COVID-19 in an inpatient and outpatient setting. The proposed  protocol is taking into consideration that resources during the pandemic are  limited.

AB  - Favipiravir is a selective RNA polymerase inhibitor and a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, an important agent used in viral infections, including Ebola,  Lassa, and COVID-19. This study aims to evaluate the potential toxicological  effects of favipiravir administration on rats' liver and kidney tissues.  Favipiravir was applied for five and ten days in the present study. During this  period, it was aimed to determine possible toxic effects on the liver and kidney.  For this purpose, the impact of favipiravir on liver and kidney tissues were  examined using histopathologic and biochemical methods. The present study showed  that favipiravir administration led to an elevation in the liver and kidney serum  enzymes and oxidative and histopathologic damages. Favipiravir administration  caused apoptotic cell death (Caspase-3 and Bcl-2), inflammation (NF-κB and IL-6),  and a decrease in renal reabsorption (AQP2) levels. In the evaluation of the  findings obtained in this study, it was determined that the favipiravir or  metabolites caused liver and kidney damages.

AB  - The urgent need for a cure for early phase COVID-19 infected patients critically underlines drug repositioning strategies able to efficiently identify new and  reliable treatments by merging computational, experimental, and pharmacokinetic  expertise. Here we report new potential therapeutics for COVID-19 identified with  a combined virtual and experimental screening strategy and selected among already  approved drugs. We used hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), one of the most studied drugs  in current clinical trials, as a reference template to screen for structural  similarity against a library of almost 4000 approved drugs. The top-ranked drugs,  based on structural similarity to HCQ, were selected for in vitro antiviral  assessment. Among the selected drugs, both zuclopenthixol and nebivolol  efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection with EC(50) values in the low micromolar  range, as confirmed by independent experiments. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of  ambroxol, amodiaquine, and its active metabolite (N-monodesethyl amodiaquine) is  also discussed. In trying to understand the "hydroxychloroquine" mechanism of  action, both pK (a) and the HCQ aromatic core may play a role. Further, we show  that the amodiaquine metabolite and, to a lesser extent, zuclopenthixol and  nebivolol are active in a SARS-CoV-2 titer reduction assay. Given the need for  improved efficacy and safety, we propose zuclopenthixol, nebivolol, and  amodiaquine as potential candidates for clinical trials against the early phase  of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss their potential use as adjuvant to the  current (i.e., remdesivir and favipiravir) COVID-19 therapeutics.

AB  - The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a global health pandemic that started in December 2019. The effective drug target among  coronaviruses is the main protease M(pro), because of its essential role in  processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. In this  study, the bioactivity of some selected heterocyclic drugs named Favipiravir (1),  Amodiaquine (2), 2'-Fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (3), and Ribavirin (4) was evaluated  as inhibitors and nucleotide analogues for COVID-19 using computational modeling  strategies. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to  estimate the thermal parameters, dipole moment, polarizability, and molecular  electrostatic potential of the present drugs; additionally, Mulliken atomic  charges of the drugs as well as the chemical reactivity descriptors were  investigated. The nominated drugs were docked on SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB:  6LU7) to evaluate the binding affinity of these drugs. Besides, the computations  data of DFT the docking simulation studies was predicted that the Amodiaquine (2)  has the least binding energy (-7.77 Kcal/mol) and might serve as a good inhibitor  to SARS-CoV-2 comparable with the approved medicines, hydroxychloroquine, and  remdesivir which have binding affinity -6.06 and -4.96 Kcal/mol, respectively.  The high binding affinity of 2 was attributed to the presence of three hydrogen  bonds along with different hydrophobic interactions between the drug and the  critical amino acids residues of the receptor. Finally, the estimated molecular  electrostatic potential results by DFT were used to illustrate the molecular  docking findings. The DFT calculations showed that drug 2 has the highest of  lying HOMO, electrophilicity index, basicity, and dipole moment. All these  parameters could share with different extent to significantly affect the binding  affinity of these drugs with the active protein sites.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic with  a high growth rate of confirmed cases. Therefore, therapeutic options are  desperately urgent to fight with this damning virus. As it may take years to  develop a specific therapy of COVID-19, it is urgent to emphasize the repurposing  of drugs used for other conditions. This study reviewed the most common drugs for  COVID-19 based on available online literature representing the latest in vitro  clinical trial database, rational of use, adverse effects, potential toxicities,  and US National Institute of Health (NIH) recommendation to use for COVID-19.  Based on the preliminary data from clinical trials and considering the NIH and  FDA recommendation, remdesivir and convalescent blood products are the most  promising potential for COVID-19 treatment. The use of chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, ivermectin, and colchicine might also be  effective. However, furthermore, in vivo investigations are needed in detail  individually and in combination for possible benefits in humans. Besides,  tocilizumab might be deemed as adjunctive therapy for patients with cytokine  release syndrome. However, lopinavir-ritonavir, anakinra, and sarilumab had not  proven their clinical efficacy. Eventually, sarilumab has been withdrawn from  sponsored clinical trials based on the preliminary data. Baricitinib and  ruxolitinib have the additive immunosuppressive effect. Consequently, all of  these drugs are being evaluated with further studies. In addition, drug-drug  interaction and safety concerns must be taken into account before the  administration of the recommended drugs.

AB  - The highly contagious Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a newborn infectious  member of the dangerous beta-coronaviruses (β-CoVs) following SARS and MERS-CoVs,  can be regarded as the most significant issue afflicting the whole world shortly  after December 2019. Considering CoVs as RNA viruses with a single-stranded RNA  genome (+ssRNA), the critical viral enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is  a promising therapeutic target for the potentially fatal infection COVID-19.  Nicotinamide riboside (NR), which is a naturally occurring analogue of Niacin  (vitamin B3), is expected to have therapeutic effects on COVID-19 due to its  super close structural similarity to the proven RdRp inhibitors. Thus, at the  first phase of the current molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies, we  targeted SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. On the next phase, SARS-CoV RdRp, human  Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, and the  SARS-CoV-2 Structural Glycoproteins Spike, Nonstructural viral protein  3-Chymotrypsin-like protease, and Papain-like protease were targeted using the  docking simulation to find other possible antiviral effects of NR  serendipitously. In the current study, the resulted scores from molecular docking  and dynamics simulations as the primary determinative factor as well as the  observed reliable binding modes have demonstrated that Nicotinamide Riboside and  its active metabolite NMN can target human ACE2 and IMPDH, along with the viral  S(pro), M(pro), PL(pro), and on top of all, RdRp as a potential competitive  inhibitor.

AB  - For the initial phase of pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), repurposing drugs that in vitro inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been attempted with overlooked or overestimated  efficacy owing to limited clinical evidence. Most early clinical trials have the  defects of study design, small sample size, non-randomized design, or different  timings of treatment initiation. However, well-designed studies on asymptomatic  or mild, or pediatric cases of COVID-19 are scarce and desperately needed to meet  the clinical need. However, a trend could be observed based on current clinical  evidence. Remdesivir and favipiravir may shorten the recovery time;  lopinavir/ritonavir does not demonstrate treatment efficacy in severe patients.  Triple therapy of ribavirin, lopinavir, and interferon β-1b showed early viral  negative conversion, and the major effect may be related to interferon. Some  small sample-size studies showed that interleukin-6 inhibitors may demonstrate  clinical improvement; non-critical patients may benefit from convalescent plasma  infusion in small sample-size studies; and the role of hydroxychloroquine or  chloroquine in the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 remains unclear.  Combination therapy of traditional Chinese medicine with antiviral agents (ex.  interferon, lopinavir, or arbidol) may alleviate inflammation in severe COVID-19  patients based on small sample-sized observational studies and experts' opinion.  Most of the published studies included severe or critical patients with COVID-19.  Combination therapy of antiviral agents and immune-modulating drugs is reasonable  especially for those critical COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome.  Drugs to blunt cytokine release might not benefit for patients in the early stage  with mild disease or the late stage with critical illness. Traditional Chinese  medicine with antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2 and immune-modulation is widely  used for COVID-19 patients in China, and is worthy of further studies. In this  review, we aim to highlight the available therapeutic options for COVID-19 based  on current clinical evidence and encourage clinical trials specific for children  and for patients with mild disease or at the early stage of COVID-19.

AB  - A novel stability-indicating, reversed-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was developed and validated for the determination  of favipiravir in an oral suspension. The effective separation of favipiravir and  its degradation products was achieved on a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column (5 μm  particle size, 150 mm length × 4.6 mm diameter). The mobile phase was prepared by  mixing 5 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 3.5) and methanol in a 75:25 v/v ratio  delivered at a 1.0 mL/min flow rate. The eluents were monitored using a  photodiode array detector at a wavelength of 322 nm. The stability-indicating  nature of this method was evaluated by performing force degradation studies under  various stress conditions, such as acidic, alkali, oxidative, thermal, and  photolytic degradation. Significant degradation was observed during the alkali  stress degradation condition. The degradation products generated during various  stress conditions were well separated from the favipiravir peak. In addition, the  major degradation product formed under alkali stress conditions was identified  using UPLC-ESI-TQ-MS/MS and NMR. Method validation was performed according to the  ICH Q2 (R1) guideline requirements. The developed method is simple, accurate,  robust, and reliable for routine quality control analysis of favipiravir oral  suspensions.

AB  - Elevated liver enzymes are frequently reported in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Several mechanisms of liver injury have been proposed, but no clear conclusions  were drawn. We aimed to evaluate hepatocellular and cholestatic injury in  relation to the administration of potentially hepatotoxic drugs included in the  current COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines in a retrospective cohort of 396  hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The main findings of our study are: (1)  Significant increase in aminotransferases level was observed during  hospitalization, suggesting drug-related hepatotoxicity. (2) Tocilizumab was  correlated with hepatocellular injury, including ALT values greater than five  times the upper limit of normal. (3) Anakinra was correlated with ALT values  greater than three times the upper limit of normal. (4) Younger patients  receiving tocilizumab or anakinra had a higher risk of hepatocellular injury. (5)  The combination of favipiravir with tocilizumab was associated with AST values  greater than three times the upper limit of normal and with an increase in direct  bilirubin. (6) The administration of at least three potentially hepatotoxic drugs  was correlated with hepatocellular injury, including ALT values greater than five  times the upper limit of normal, and with the increase in indirect bilirubin. (7)  Remdesivir and favipiravir by themselves did not correlate with hepatocellular or  cholestatic injury in our study cohort.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The latest coronavirus infection due to SARS-CoV-2, which started in China in December 2019, was announced as a pandemic by the World Health  Organization (WHO) in March 2020. All epidemiological data so far show us that  SARS-CoV-2 infection is less serious in children than in adults. Allergic asthma,  the most common chronic disease in children, is usually not to be related to  greater risk or severity for COVID-19 in pediatric populations. Although  reports/research on asthma and COVID-19 in children have thus far been  comforting, when coming across an asthma patient with any lower airway infection,  attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and the  possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case Report. Here, we report a rare  adolescent case of COVID-19-related pneumonia development with underlying asthma.  A 16-year-old male patient has been followed up by the pediatric allergy  outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of asthma for the last 5 years. He was  thought to have typical clinical and laboratory findings for SARS-CoV-2 infection  combined with underlying pediatric (allergic) asthma. Pulmonary CT showed  findings consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia. He was discharged after 1  week when all his complaints regressed, his examination became normal, and 5-day  favipiravir treatment was completed. CONCLUSION: When a physician comes across an  asthma patient with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to  evaluate their asthma control level and possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - In 2018, the discovery of carcinogenic nitrosamine process related impurities (PRIs) in a group of widely used drugs led to the recall and complete withdrawal  of several medications that were consumed for a long time, unaware of the  presence of these genotoxic PRIs. Since then, PRIs that arise during the  manufacturing process of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), together  with their degradation impurities, have gained the attention of analytical  chemistry researchers. In 2020, favipiravir (FVR) was found to have an effective  antiviral activity against the SARS-COVID-19 virus. Therefore, it was included in  the COVID-19 treatment protocols and was consequently globally manufactured at  large-scales during the pandemic. There is information indigence about FVR  impurity profiling, and until now, no method has been reported for the  simultaneous determination of FVR together with its PRIs. In this study, five  advanced multi-level design models were developed and validated for the  simultaneous determination of FVR and two PRIs, namely;  (6-chloro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide) and  (3,6-dichloro-pyrazine-2-carbonitrile). The five developed models were classical  least square (CLS), principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares  (PLS), genetic algorithm-partial least squares (GA-PLS), and artificial neural  networks (ANN). Five concentration levels of each compound, chosen according to  the linearity range of the target analytes, were used to construct a five-level,  three-factor chemometric design, giving rise to twenty-five mixtures. The models  resolved the strong spectral overlap in the UV-spectra of the FVR and its PRIs.  The PCR and PLS models exhibited the best performances, while PLS proved the  highest sensitivity relative to the other models.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The safety profile of favipiravir in patients with severe renal impairment has not been investigated and available data are insufficient. The  study aimed to compare the incidence of favipiravir-associated adverse events  amongst patients with varying renal function statuses. METHODS: Records of 921  patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and had received at least 5 days of  favipiravir treatment were retrospectively evaluated and 228 patients were  included in the study. Patients' age, sex, comorbidities, estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFR) and haematological and biochemical values were recorded.  The incidence of adverse events was compared with the age, sex, comorbidities and  eGFR of the patients. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was  59.3 ± 15.6 years, and 38.2% of the patients were women. One hundred and  thirty-one (57.5%) patients had experienced adverse events. These adverse effects  consisted of ALT elevation (35.5%), AST elevation (21.5%), anaemia (16.2%),  hyperuricaemia (10.5%), hepatocellular injury (9.2%), neutropenia (3.5%) and  thrombocytopenia (2.6%). The incidence of adverse events was not significantly  different when patients had eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or eGFR  30-60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (P > .05), but significantly increased when the eGFR  dropped to <30 (P < .05). The differences seen with hyperuricaemia and anaemia  were significant (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Even though favipiravir appeared to be  well tolerated in the individuals with renal failure in this study, its use in  this population remains a challenge that requires more research and analysis.

T2  - Journal of virus eradication
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repurposing broad-spectrum antivirals is an immediate treatment opportunity for 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Favipiravir is an antiviral  previously indicated for influenza and Ebola, which has shown some promise in  early trials for treatment of COVID-19. We aim to review existing favipiravir  safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of  favipiravir in COVID-19. METHODS: A search was conducted across EMBASE and  MEDLINE databases, supplemented by relevant grey-literature and  ClinicalTrials.gov. All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27  March 2020 were considered for inclusion. Further analysis of available safety  data from phase 2 and 3 studies was undertaken. Data extracted were adverse  events (AEs) grade 1-4, serious AEs and discontinuation for AEs. Specific AEs of  interest highlighted in early-phase studies, including gastrointestinal AEs and  hyperuricaemia, were also examined. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were identified  as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir. Six were  phase 2 and 3 studies reporting relevant safety data for statistical comparison,  representing a total of 4299 participants, an estimated 175  person-years-of-follow-up (PYFU). Comparator drugs were oseltamivir, umifenovir,  lopinavir/ritonavir or placebo. Study follow-up was between 5 and 21 days. The  proportions of grade 1-4 AEs on favipiravir was 28.2% vs 28.4% (P = n.s.) in the  comparison arms. The proportion of discontinuations due to AEs on favipiravir was  1.1% vs 1.2% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. For serious AEs the proportion  was 0.4% in both arms (P = n.s.). There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal  AEs occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8.7% vs 11.5%; P = 0.003].  Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8%  vs 1.3%; P<0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety  profile regarding total and serious AEs. However, safety concerns remain:  hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately  studied. Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more  evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment. Given the  limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted  in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVID-19.

AB  - PURPOSE: A number of research articles has been published evaluating safety and efficacy of drugs against COVID-19. This study was undertaken to collate and  review the information regarding common proposed anti- viral drugs for easy  reference. METHODS: The literature was search was done using terms like severe  acute respiratory syndrome or SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV or COVID-19 in  combination with drugs or treatment or pharmaco-therapy using PubMed and google  scholar to identify relevant articles. RESULTS: Despite showing good early  results, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir has not shown clinical  benefit in randomized controlled trials. However lopinavir in combination with  other drugs specially interferon is being investigated. Remdesivir has shown  positive effect in terms of clinical improvement and continued to being  investigated alone or in combination with other drugs. Favipiravir has shown  mixed results and more data from adequately powered study is needed to prove its  efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Many drugs which showed positive effect in initial studies  could not replicate the same benefit in large randomized controlled trials. There  is need to evaluate efficacy and safety of drugs based on high quality evidence  before allowing it to be used in general population.

AB  - Favipiravir is an established antiviral that is currently being assessed as an investigational drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Favipiravir is strikingly  similar to two molecules that the World Health Organization (WHO) lists as  essential medicines, which also consist of a six-membered aromatic N-heterocycle  bearing a carboxamide function: the anti-tuberculosis agent, pyrazinamide, and  nicotinamide, also known as vitamin B(3) . We demonstrate the utility of (1) H  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) profiling, an emerging pharmacopoeial tool, for  the highly specific identification, selective differentiation of congeners, and  subsequent detection of drug falsification or adulteration of these medicines.  The straightforward comparison of basic 1-D (1) H NMR spectra, obtained with  benchtop or advanced NMR instruments alike, offers a rapid identity assay and  works independently of physical reference materials. This approach accelerates  and advances pharmaceutical quality control measures under situations of  increased drug demand and altered economy, such as during a pandemic.

AB  - Countless people have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic on a global scale. Favipiravir, has shown potential as an effective drug for SARS-CoV-2, attracting  scientists' attention. However, overuse of Favipiravir easily leads to serious  side effects, requiring real-time monitoring in body fluids. Given this, a new  lanthanide metal organic framework (MOF) was prepared under solvothermal  conditions from either Eu (Eu-MOF or (1)) or Tb (Tb-MOF or (2)) using the highly  delocalized imidazoledicarboxylic acid linker H2L (H2L = 5-(4-(imidazol-1-yl)  phenyl) isophthalic acid) and could be successfully applied to selective optical  detection of Favipiravir. In this MOF framework, the organic linker H2L provides  a high excitation energy transfer efficiency that can sensitize luminescence in  lanthanides. In addition, through deliberate tuning of Eu/Tb molar ratio and  reaction concentration in the lanthanide framework, ratiometric recyclable  luminescent EuxTb1-x-MOF nanoparticles with open metal sites have been  constructed, which present a high detection sensitivity (Ksv = 1×107 [M-1],  detection limit is 4.63 nM) for Favipiravir. The detection mechanism is discussed  with the help of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that sheds light  over the selective sensing of Favipiravir over other related COVID-19 drug  candidates. Finally, to explore the practical application of Favipiravir sensing,  MOF based thin films have been used for visual detection of Favipiravir and  recycled 5 times.

AB  - Due to the lack of an etiologic treatment for SARS-CoV-2 and the difficulties involved in developing new drugs, some drugs already approved for other diseases  or with efficacy against SARS and MERS, have been used in patients with COVID-19.  This systematic review aims to summarize evidence on the efficacy and safety of  five antivirals applied to patients with COVID-19, that have proven to be  effective either in vitro studies or in studies on SARS-CoV and MERS.; An  intensive search of different databases (Pub Med, WoS, MEDLINE and Cochrane  COVID-19 Study Register) has been carried out until the end of April 2021. This  systematic review has been conducted according to the PRISMA statement. From each  of the included studies, the characteristics of the intervention and comparison  groups, demographic data and results were extracted independently; Remdesivir is  well tolerated and helps to accelerate clinical improvement but is ineffective in  reducing mortality. Favipiravir is safe and shows promising results regarding  symptom resolution but does not improve viral clearance. The use of  lopinavir/ritonavir has been associated with an increased risk of  gastrointestinal adverse events and it has not proven to be effective. No  significant differences were observed between patients treated with ribavirin or  umifenovir and their respective control groups; Remdesivir and favipiravir are  well tolerated and effective in accelerating clinical improvement. This  systematic review does not support the use of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and  umifenovir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of favipiravir antiviral in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly in the more  progressed disease phase. This study aims to evaluate the favipiravir effect on  reducing the length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality among moderate and  severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter  observational study was conducted that included moderate and severe hospitalized  adult COVID-19 patients in four major regions (Riyadh (Riyadh), Eastern (Dammam),  Al-Qassem (Buraydah), and Macca (Jeddah) of Saudi Arabia. For the primary outcome  of all-cause mortality, a Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed. While  the association between favipiravir use and length of hospital stay was  determined using adjusted generalized linear model. This study was approved by  the Central Institutional Review Board in The Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) with  the approval number IRB # 20-85-M. RESULTS: This study included 598 moderate and  severe COVID-19 patients, of whom 156 (26%) received favipiravir. Favipiravir  treatment was associated with more extended hospital stays (14 vs. 10 median  days, P = 0.034) and higher mortality rate (aHR 3.63; 95% CI 1.06-12.45) compared  to no favipiravir regimen. Despite lack of effectiveness, favipiravir use was  only associated with higher diarrhea adverse effects (12 vs. 5%, P = 0.002), but  it did not affect the renal and liver profiles of patients. CONCLUSION:  Favipiravir was ineffective in reducing the length of hospital stay and  in-hospital mortality in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19.

AB  - The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an essential enzyme for the viral replication process, catalyzing the viral RNA synthesis using a metal  ion-dependent mechanism. In recent years, RdRp has emerged as an optimal target  for the development of antiviral drugs, as demonstrated by recent approvals of  sofosbuvir and remdesivir against Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respectively. In this work, we  overview the main sequence and structural features of the RdRp of emerging RNA  viruses such as Coronaviruses, Flaviviruses, and HCV, as well as inhibition  strategies implemented so far. While analyzing the structural information  available on the RdRp of emerging RNA viruses, we provide examples of success  stories such as for HCV and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, Flaviviruses' story has  raised attention about how the lack of structural details on  catalytically-competent or ligand-bound RdRp strongly hampers the application of  structure-based drug design, either in repurposing and conventional approaches.

AB  - The emergence of highly virulent CoVs (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of novel ongoing "COVID-19" pandemics has been marked as an alarming case of pneumonia  posing a large global healthcare crisis of unprecedented magnitude. Currently,  the COVID-19 outbreak has fueled an international demand in the biomedical field  for the mitigation of the fast-spreading illness, all through the urgent  deployment of safe, effective, and rational therapeutic strategies along with  epidemiological control. Confronted with such contagious respiratory distress,  the global population has taken significant steps towards a more robust strategy  of containment and quarantine to halt the total number of positive cases but such  a strategy can only delay the spread. A substantial number of potential vaccine  candidates are undergoing multiple clinical trials to combat COVID-19 disease,  includes live-attenuated, inactivated, viral-vectored based, sub-unit vaccines,  DNA, mRNA, peptide, adjuvant, plant, and nanoparticle-based vaccines. However,  there are no licensed anti-COVID-19 drugs/therapies or vaccines that have proven  to work as more effective therapeutic candidates in open-label clinical trial  studies. To counteract the infection (SARS-CoV-2), many people are under  prolonged treatment of many chemical drugs that inhibit the PLpro activity  (Ribavirin), viral proteases (Lopinavir/Ritonavir), RdRp activity (Favipiravir,  Remdesivir), viral membrane fusion (Umifenovir, Chloroquine phosphate (CQ),  Hydroxychloroquine phosphate (HCQ), IL-6 overexpression (Tocilizumab, Siltuximab,  Sarilumab). Mesenchymal Stem Cell therapy and Convalescent Plasma Therapy have  emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 virion. On the  other hand, repurposing previously designed antiviral agents with tolerable  safety profile and efficacy could be the only promising approach and fast  response to the novel virion. In addition, research institutions and corporations  have commenced the redesign of the available therapeutic strategy to manage the  global crisis. Herein, we present succinct information on selected anti-COVID-19  therapeutic medications repurposed to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, this  review will provide exhaustive detail on recent prophylactic strategies and  ongoing clinical trials to curb this deadly pandemic, outlining the major  therapeutic areas for researchers to step in.

AB  - Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and favipiravir (FPV) are known to be effective antivirals, and there are reports about their use to fight the severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) despite that these are not  conclusive. The use of combined drugs is common in drug discovery, and thus, we  investigated HCQ and FPV as a combined drug. The density functional theory method  was used for the optimization of geometries, spectroscopic analysis and  calculation of reactivity parameters. The quantum theory of atoms in molecules  was applied to explain the nature of the hydrogen bonds and confirm the higher  stability of the combined drug. We also evaluated the absorption, distribution,  metabolism and excretion (ADME) parameters to assess their drug actions jointly  using SwissADME. The preliminary findings of our theoretical study are promising  for further investigations of more potent and selective antiviral drugs.

AB  - Remdesivir (REM) and Favipiravir (FAV) are recently approved antivirals prescribed in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Therefore, development of new,  simple, rapid, sensitive, and selective methods for analysis of such drugs in  their pharmaceutical formulations will be highly advantageous. Herein, we have  developed different spectrophotometric methods for analysis of the studied  analytes. Method I is based on direct spectrophotometric analysis of REM and FAV  in ethanol at λ(max) 244 and 323 nm, respectively. For simultaneous quantitation  of REM and FAV, methods II-V were followed. Method II is based on derivative  spectrophotometry in which REM was determined in second-order derivative spectra  at 248 nm (the zero-crossing wavelength for FAV), while FAV was measured in  first-order derivative spectra at 337 nm (the zero-crossing point for REM).  Method III is the dual-wavelength method in which spectral intensities were  subtracted at 244-207 nm for REM and at 330-400 nm for FAV. Method IV is the  ratio subtraction in which ratio spectra were obtained by a suitable divisor  followed by subtraction of intensities at 272-340 nm and 335-222 nm for REM and  FAV, respectively. Method V is the derivative ratio method in which the obtained  ratio spectra in method IV were converted to first-order derivative and then REM  and FAV were recorded at 280 and 340 nm, respectively. Calibration graphs were  linear in the ranges of 1-10 µg/mL for REM through all methods and 1-20 µg/mL for  FAV in methods I and II, and 2-20 µg/mL by the other methods. The evolved methods  were applied to pharmaceutical dosage forms of REM and FAV. All the proposed  methods were further applied to human plasma samples containing both drugs with  acceptable mean recoveries.

AB  - In December 2019, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related epidemic was first observed in Wuhan, China. In 2020, owing  to the highly infectious and deadly nature of the virus, this widespread novel  coronavirus disease 2019 (nCOVID-19) became a worldwide pandemic. Studies have  revealed that various environmental factors including temperature, humidity, and  air pollution may also affect the transmission pattern of COVID-19.  Unfortunately, still, there is no specific drug that has been validated in  large-scale studies to treat patients with confirmed nCOVID-19. However,  remdesivir, an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), has appeared as  an auspicious antiviral drug. Currently, a large-scale study on remdesivir (i.e.,  200 mg on first day, then 100 mg once/day) is ongoing to evaluate its clinical  efficacy to treat nCOVID-19. Good antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 was not  observed with the use of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). Nonetheless, the  combination of umifenovir and LPV/r was found to have better antiviral activity.  Furthermore, a combination of hydroxychloroquine (i.e., 200 mg 3 times/day) and  azithromycin (i.e., 500 mg on first day, then 250 mg/day from day 2-5) also  exhibited good activity. Currently, there are also ongoing studies to evaluate  the efficacy of teicoplanin and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against  SARS-CoV-2. Thus, in this article, we have analyzed the genetic diversity and  molecular pathogenesis of nCOVID-19. We also present possible therapeutic options  for nCOVID-19 patients.

AB  - A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has spread over more than 100 countries all over the world. The World Health Organization has  recognized Coronavirus as a pandemic and finding an effective drug for this  infectious disease is of high importance. In this study, we have explored the  potent inhibitors of COVID-19 main protease from Tinospora cordifolia an  Ayurvedic herb locally called as Amrita meaning 'immortality' and two other  Ayurveda plants namely Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Myristica fragrans. Saponarin, a  phytochemical present in Tinospora cordifolia showed a very promising result with  the binding affinity of - 8.75 kcal/mol. Remdesivir and Favipiravir, the  experimental drugs that are known to show inhibitory activity towards COVID-19  are used as a control. The Docking results were verified by the means of  molecular dynamic analysis. This study suggests that Saponarin can be a potential  inhibitor for the main protease of the COVID-19.

AB  - Favipiravir (FAV; T-705) has been approved for use as an anti-influenza therapeutic and has reports against a wide range of viruses (e.g., Ebola virus,  rabies and norovirus). Most recently FAV has been reported to demonstrate  activity against SARS-CoV-2. Repurposing opportunities have been intensively  studied with only limited success to date. If successful, repurposing will allow  interventions to become more rapidly available than development of new chemical  entities. Pre-clinical and clinical investigations of FAV require robust,  reproducible and sensitive bioanalytical assay. Here, a liquid chromatography  tandem mass spectrometry assay is presented which was linear from 0.78-200 ng/mL  Accuracy and precision ranged between 89% and 110%, 101% and 106%, respectively.  The presented assay here has applications in both pre-clinical and clinical  research and may be used to facilitate further investigations into the  application of FAV against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Chinese city of Wuhan has caused around 906,092 deaths and 28,040,853  confirmed cases worldwide (https://covid19.who.int/, 11 September 2020). In a  life-threatening situation, where there is no specific and licensed anti-COVID-19  vaccine or medicine available; the repurposed drug might act as a silver bullet.  Currently, more than 211 vaccines, 80 antibodies, 31 antiviral drugs, 35  cell-based, 6 RNA-based and 131 other drugs are in clinical trials. It is  therefore utter need of the hour to develop an effective drug that can be used  for the treatment of COVID-19 before a vaccine can be developed. One of the  best-characterized and attractive drug targets among coronaviruses is the main  protease (3CL(pro)). Therefore, the current study focuses on the molecular  docking analysis of TAT-peptide(47-57) (GRKKRRQRRRP)-conjugated repurposed drugs  (i.e., lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine) with SARS-CoV-2  main protease (3CL(pro)) to discover potential efficacy of TAT-peptide (TP) -  conjugated repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The molecular docking results  validated that TP-conjugated ritonavir, lopinavir, favipiravir, and  hydroxychloroquine have superior and significantly enhanced interactions with the  target SARS-CoV-2 main protease. In-silico approach employed in this study  suggests that the combination of the drug with TP is an excelling alternative to  develop a novel drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The  development of TP based delivery of repurposing drugs might be an excellent  approach to enhance the efficacy of the existing drugs for the treatment of  COVID-19. The predictions from the results obtained provide invaluable  information that can be utilized for the choice of candidate drugs for in vitro,  in vivo and clinical trials. The outcome from this work prove crucial for  exploring and developing novel cost-effective and biocompatible TP conjugated  anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agents in immediate future.

AB  - Nucleotide analogs targeting viral RNA polymerase have been proved to be an effective strategy for antiviral treatment and are promising antiviral drugs to  combat the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  pandemic. In this study, we developed a robust in vitro nonradioactive primer  extension assay to quantitatively evaluate the efficiency of incorporation of  nucleotide analogs by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Our results  show that many nucleotide analogs can be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp  and that the incorporation of some of them leads to chain termination. The  discrimination values of nucleotide analogs over those of natural nucleotides  were measured to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by  SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In agreement with the data published in the literature, we found  that the incorporation efficiency of remdesivir-TP is higher than that of ATP and  incorporation of remdesivir-TP caused delayed chain termination, which can be  overcome by higher concentrations of the next nucleotide to be incorporated. Our  data also showed that the delayed chain termination pattern caused by  remdesivir-TP incorporation is different for different template sequences.  Multiple incorporations of remdesivir-TP caused chain termination under our assay  conditions. Incorporation of sofosbuvir-TP is very low, suggesting that  sofosbuvir may not be very effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a  comparison, 2'-C-methyl-GTP can be incorporated into RNA efficiently, and the  derivative of 2'-C-methyl-GTP may have therapeutic application in treating  SARS-CoV-2 infection. This report provides a simple screening method that should  be useful for evaluating nucleotide-based drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and for  studying the mechanism of action of selected nucleotide analogs.

AB  - We retrospectively investigated the clinical outcomes of favipiravir in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients who between 23 May 2020 and 18 July 2020  received ≥ 24 h of favipiravir were assigned to the favipiravir group, while  those who did not formed the non-favipiravir group. The primary outcome was  28-day clinical improvement, defined as two-category improvement from baseline on  an 8-point ordinal scale. Propensity scores (PS) for favipiravir therapy were  used for 1:1 matching. The unmatched cohort included 1493 patients, of which  51.7% were in the favipiravir group, and 48.3% were not receiving supplemental  oxygen at baseline. Significant baseline differences between the two unmatched  groups existed, but not between the PS-matched groups (N = 774). After  PS-matching, there were no significant differences between the two groups in the  proportion with 28-day clinical improvement (93.3% versus 92.8%, P 0.780), or  28-day all-cause mortality (2.1% versus 3.1%, P 0.360). Favipiravir was  associated with more viral clearance by day 28 (79.8% versus 64.1%, P < 0.001).  Adverse events were common in both groups, but the 93.9% were Grades 1-3.  Favipiravir therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia is well tolerated but is not  associated with an increased likelihood of clinical improvement or reduced  all-cause mortality by 28 days.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anticoagulant therapy for patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia is considered to improve the hypercoagulable and  inflammatory state. However, bleeding complications should also be considered.  CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old man with a history of falls was diagnosed with  COVID-19. Owing to his severe condition, he was intubated and transferred to our  hospital for intensive care. Favipiravir, tocilizumab, unfractionated heparin,  and ART-123 were administered to treat COVID-19 and manage the antithrombotic  prophylaxis for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (Af). On the 6th day after  admission, a hematoma was noted on the left chest wall. Computed tomography (CT)  revealed multiple hematomas, including hematomas on his chest wall and  obturatorius internus muscle. Emergency angiography transcatheter embolization  (TAE) was performed. The patient was transferred to another hospital 23 days  after TAE, without complications. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that  anticoagulation therapy and a history of falls induced multiple hematomas in a  COVID-19 patient and that the condition was managed with TAE. When anticoagulants  are considered in the management of Af and COVID-19 associated coagulopathy, it  is necessary to closely monitor potential bleeding complications.

AB  - COVID-19 infection is associated with systemic inflammation, and sometimes hyperinflammatory responses with cytokine storm. This plays a major role in  COVID-19 severity and poor disease prognosis, even death. Higher levels of  inflammatory hallmarks including C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimers, and  cytokines such as interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α)  have been reported. Many anti-viral drugs have been tried, but none were proven  fully effective. Supportive care and management of the complications that are  caused mainly by inflammation might be the key to greater survival rates and  shorter hospitalization (e.g., the use of remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir,  umifenovir (arbidol), oseltamivir, ganciclovir, favipiravir, darunavir,  hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, anakinra, canakinumab,  tocilizumab, siltuximab, sarilumab, Type 1 interferon, interferon β-1a,  interferon α- 2b, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, fedratinib, methylprednisolone and  dexamethasone). However, the efficacy of these treatments still needs  well-planned clinical trials. In such trials, careful attention must be paid to  the duration of the treatment, the onset of beneficial effects, and the severity  of the disease, otherwise, the outcomes may still remain inconclusive. Herein, we  present a review of the current drugs, which are being used in the management of  the disease and their anti-inflammatory properties. We also investigated if these  drugs directly interact with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE 2), which is a  crucial component of the virus entry to the cells.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of favipiravir, which is prescribed for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) in India. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, open-label,  multicenter, single-arm postmarketing study conducted in India. Patients with  mild-to-moderate COVID-19 received favipiravir (3600 mg [1800 mg orally twice  daily] on the first day, followed by 800 mg orally twice daily, up to a maximum  of 14 days) as a part of their treatment. The primary endpoints were to evaluate  the safety of favipiravir by assessing the number of adverse events (AEs) and  treatment-related AEs. The secondary endpoints were to evaluate the efficacy of  favipiravir by assessing time to clinical cure, rate of clinical cure, time to  pyrexia resolution, rate of oxygen requirement, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS:  A total of 1083 patients were enrolled in this study from December 2020 to June  2021. Adverse events were reported in 129 patients (11.9%), 116 (10.7%) of whom  had mild AEs. Dose modification or withdrawal of favipiravir treatment was  reported in four patients (0.37%). The median time to clinical cure and pyrexia  resolution was 7 and 4 days, respectively. A total of 1036 patients (95.8%)  exhibited clinical cure by day 14. Oxygen support was required by 15 patients  (1.4%). One death was reported, which was unrelated to favipiravir. CONCLUSION:  In the real-world setting, favipiravir was well-tolerated, and no new safety  signals were detected.

AB  - Replication of RNA viruses is characterized by exploration of sequence space which facilitates their adaptation to changing environments. It is generally  accepted that such exploration takes place mainly in response to positive  selection, and that further diversification is boosted by modifications of virus  population size, particularly bottleneck events. Our recent results with  hepatitis C virus (HCV) have shown that the expansion in sequence space of a  viral clone continues despite prolonged replication in a stable cell culture  environment. Diagnosis of the expansion was based on the quantification of  diversity indices, the occurrence of intra-population mutational waves  (variations in mutant frequencies), and greater individual residue variations in  mutant spectra than those anticipated from sequence alignments in data banks. In  the present report, we review our previous results, and show additionally that  mutational waves in amplicons from the NS5A-NS5B-coding region are equally  prominent during HCV passage in the absence or presence of the mutagenic  nucleotide analogues favipiravir or ribavirin. In addition, by extending our  previous analysis to amplicons of the NS3- and NS5A-coding region, we provide  further evidence of the incongruence between amino acid conservation scores in  mutant spectra from infected patients and in the Los Alamos National Laboratory  HCV data banks. We hypothesize that these observations have as a common origin a  permanent state of HCV population disequilibrium even upon extensive viral  replication in the absence of external selective constraints or changes in  population size. Such a persistent disequilibrium-revealed by the changing  composition of the mutant spectrum-may facilitate finding alternative mutational  pathways for HCV antiviral resistance. The possible significance of our model for  other genetically variable viruses is discussed.

AB  - Favipiravir (FVR) is a repurposed antiviral drug for treating mild to moderate cases of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, its poor  solubility and permeability limit its clinical efficacy. To overcome its  physicochemical and pharmacokinetic limitations, we statistically designed a  mucoadhesive chitosan-alginate nanoparticles (MCS-ALG-NPs) as a new carrier for  FVR using response surface methodology, which provided suitable characteristics  for transmucosal delivery. The use of mucoadhesive polymers for intranasal  administration promotes the residence time and contact of FVR in the mucus  membrane. The optimized FVR-MCS-ALG-NPs demonstrated superior mucoadhesion,  higher permeation and deposition in the nasal mucosa, and a significant increase  in the inhibition of viral replication over 35-fold compared with free FVR. The  overall results suggest that MCS-ALG-NPs could be used as an effective  mucoadhesive carrier to enhance the activity of FVR against COVID-19.

AB  - Designing anticoronavirus disease 2019 (anti-COVID-19) agents is the primary concern of medicinal chemists/drug designers nowadays. Repurposing of known  active compounds against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) is a new effective and time-saving trend in anti-COVID-19 drug  discovery. Thorough inhibition of the coronaviral-2 proteins (i.e., multitarget  inhibition) is a possible powerful favorable strategy for developing effectively  potent drugs for COVID-19. In this new research study, I succeeded to repurpose  the two antioxidant polyhydroxy-1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds CoViTris2020 and  ChloViD2020 as the first multitarget coronaviral protein blockers with extremely  higher potencies (reach about 65 and 304 times, for CoViTris2020, and 20 and 93  times, for ChloViD2020, more potent than remdesivir and favipiravir,  respectively). These two 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were computationally  studied (through molecular docking in almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins) and  biologically assessed (through a newly established robust in vitro anti-COVID-19  assay) for their anticoronaviral-2 bioactivities. The data obtained from the  docking investigation showed that both ligands promisingly exhibited very strong  inhibitory binding affinities with almost all docked enzymes (e.g., they  displayed extremely lower binding energies of - 12.00 and - 9.60 kcal/mol,  respectively, with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase "RdRp"). The  results of the biological assay revealed that CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020  significantly displayed very high anti-COVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2  EC(50) = 0.31 and 1.01 μM, respectively). Further in vivo/clinical studies for  the development of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as anti-COVID-19 medications are  required. In brief, the ascent of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as the two lead  members of the novel family of anti-COVID-19 polyphenolic  2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives represents a promising hope in  COVID-19 therapy. CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 life cycle with  surprising EC(50) values of 0.31 and 1.01 μM, respectively. CoViTris2020 strongly  inhibits coronaviral-2 RdRp with exceptionally lower inhibitory binding energy of  - 12.00 kcal/mol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been declared as pandemic by  World Health Organization (WHO) with increasing morbidity (more than 4.6 million  patients) and mortality (300,000 deaths). The world-wide target of management  COVID-19 is to reduce complications with available management options; this  become highly variable from country to country and even within different regions  of the same country. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: This observational prospective study  represents a single center study in which all patients in this cohort received  almost similar medicines and care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients in this  cohort (N: 32) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  with variable presenting symptoms. The management strategy included Standard of  Care (SoC) and administration of hydroxychloroquine and doxycycline. Out of 32  patients, 9 patients also received favipiravir. All patients were followed until  they were discharged after negativity of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR on two  consecutive occasions taken within 2 days. RESULTS: No death has been recorded in  this cohort of 32 patients within the study period. The average hospital staying  duration was 13.9 days with a range of 8-21 days. All patients were discharged  with improvement of subjective symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 negativity. The vital  signs (pulse, blood pressure) as well as and levels of electrolyte and blood  counts were within normal and acceptable ranges at the time of discharge.  CONCLUSION: The study presented here provide and evidence of a real-life  situation of management of limited numbers of COVID-19 patients at a tertiary  center of Bangladesh. This study inspires optimism that proper diagnosis,  establishment of effective inclusion and exclusion criteria, ensuring application  of proper SoC with drugs available in Bangladesh may be a practical option for  management of COVID-19 in the country.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As a medical problem, hypertension is one of the most common disorders in cardiovascular disease. High blood pressure has been identified as  one of the most familiar risk factors for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We  planned to explore the possible interactions between anti-hypertensive agents and  drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 with broad investigations on these medications'  mechanism of action and adverse effects. METHOD: Two co-authors searched the  electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) to collect papers  relevant to the subject. The keywords searched were angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), sympatholytic drugs  (alpha-1 blockers, beta-blockers), vasodilators (calcium channel blockers,  nitrates, and hydralazine), diuretics, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine,  lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, interferons, azithromycin,  anti-cytokine agents, glucocorticoids, anticoagulant agents, nitric oxide and  epoprostenol. RESULTS: QT prolongation, hypokalemia, arrhythmia, and increasing  the serum level of drugs are the most dangerous adverse effects in the patients  on COVID-19 medications and anti-hypertensive drugs. CONCLUSION: This review  emphasized the importance of the potential interaction between drugs used against  COVID-19 and anti-hypertensive agents and caution must be exercised when these  medications are being used simultaneously.

AB  - Background: In addition to supportive therapy, antiviral therapy is an effective treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: To compare the  efficacy and safety of favipiravir and umifenovir (Arbidol) to treat COVID-19  patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label  multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Enrolled patients with  initial symptoms within 12 days were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive  conventional therapy plus Arbidol (200 mg*3/day) or favipiravir (1600 mg*2/first  day followed by 600 mg*2/day) for 7 days. The primary outcome was the clinical  recovery rate at day 7 of drug administration (relief for pyrexia and cough,  respiratory frequency ≤24 times/min; oxygen saturation ≥98%). Latency to relief  for pyrexia and cough and the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or  noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV)/mechanical ventilation (MV) were the  secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days. Results: A total of  240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were  assigned to receive favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 patients were assigned to  receive Arbidol (120 assessed). The clinical recovery rate at day 7 of drug  administration did not significantly differ between the favipiravir group  (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (p = 0.1396, difference in recovery rate:  0.0954; 95% CI: -0.0305∼0.2213). Favipiravir contributed to relief for both  pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, p < 0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75 days, p <  0.0001). No difference was observed in the AOT or NMV/MV rate (both p > 0.05).  The most frequently observed favipiravir-associated adverse event was increased  serum uric acid (16/116, OR: 5.52, p = 0.0014). Conclusion: Among patients with  COVID-19, favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly improve the  clinical recovery rate at day 7. Favipiravir significantly improved the latency  to relieve pyrexia and cough. Adverse effects caused by favipiravir are mild and  manageable.

AB  - With over 16 million cases reported from across the globe, the SARS-CoV-2, a mere 125 microns in diameter, has left an indelible impact on our world. With the  paucity of new drugs to combat this disease, the medical community is in a race  to identify repurposed drugs that may be effective against this novel  coronavirus. One of the drugs which has recently garnered much attention,  especially in India, is an anti-viral drug originally designed for influenza,  called favipiravir. In this article, we have tried to provide a comprehensive,  evidence-based review of this drug in the context of the present pandemic to  elucidate its role in the management of COVID-19.

AB  - Favipiravir is a wide-spectrum antiviral generic drug that has received large attention during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. While there are synthetic  strategies for favipiravir synthesis, economical procedures could contribute to  industrial scale synthesis and availability. Accordingly, our efforts focused on  an economic and scalable procedure for favipiravir synthesis via the  3,6-dichloropyrazine-2-carbonitrile intermediate obtained from  3-aminopyrazine-2-carboxylic acid. The process afforded favipiravir with 43%  yield (from 3,6-dichloropyrazine-2-carbonitrile, by fluorination, hydroxylation,  and nitrile hydrolysis reactions) and greater than 99% purity without a  chromatographic purification step.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a fast-paced epidemic in late 2019 which is disrupting life-saving immunization services. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly  transmissible virus and an infectious disease that has caused fear among people  across the world. The worldwide emergence and rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2  emphasizes the need for exploring innovative therapeutic approaches to combat  SARS-CoV-2. The efficacy of some antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir,  umifenovir, etc., are still tested against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, there is a  large global effort to develop vaccines for the protection against COVID-19.  Because vaccines seem the best solution to control the pandemic but time is  required for its development, pre-clinical/clinical trials, approval from FDA and  scale-up. The nano-based approach is another promising approach to combat  COVID-19 owing to unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials. Peptide  based vaccines emerged as promising vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2. The study  emphasizes the current therapeutic approaches against SARS-CoV-2 and some of the  potential candidates for SARS-CoV-2 treatment which are still under clinical  studies for their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, it is of high  importance to mention that clinical trials are necessary for confirming promising  drug candidates and effective vaccines and the safety profile of the new  components must be evaluated before translation of in vitro studies for  implementation in clinical use.

AB  - Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are widely used as modifiers in electrochemical sensors due to their high sensitivity and promise of inexpensive  mass manufacturing. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel MIP-sensor that can  measure the electrochemical activity of favipiravir (FAV) as an antiviral drug,  thereby enabling quantification of the concentration of FAV in biological and  river water samples and in real-time. MOF nanoparticles' application with various  shapes to determine FAV at nanomolar concentrations was described. Two different  MOF nanoparticle shapes (dodecahedron and sheets) were systematically compared to  evaluate the electrochemical performance of FAV. After carefully examining two  different morphologies of MIP-Co-Ni@MOF, the nanosheet form showed a higher  performance and efficiency than the nanododecahedron. When MIP-Co/Ni@MOF-based  and NIP-Co/Ni@MOF electrodes (nanosheets) were used instead, the minimum target  concentrations detected were 7.5 × 10(-11) (MIP-Co-Ni@MOF) and 8.17 × 10(-9) M  (NIP-Co-Ni@MOF), respectively. This is a significant improvement (&gt;10(2)),  which is assigned to the large active surface area and high fraction of surface  atoms, increasing the amount of greater analyte adsorption during binding.  Therefore, water-dispersible MIP-Co-Ni@MOF nanosheets were successfully applied  for trace-level determination of FAV in biological and water samples. Our  findings seem to provide useful guidance in the molecularly imprinted polymer  design of MOF-based materials to help establish quantitative rules in designing  MOF-based sensors for point of care (POC) systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The antiviral agent favipiravir is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined patients with a clinical,  laboratory, and radiological diagnosis of severe coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) pneumonia. We investigated the effect of administering enteral  favipiravir at a 2 × 1,600 mg loading dose and 2 × 600 mg maintenance dose for 5  days in addition to the standard COVID-19 treatment. RESULTS: In total, 180  patients, who were hospitalized at the Istanbul Tuzla State Hospital and received  favipiravir treatment between March 20, 2020 and May 30, 2020, were examined. Of  these, 47 patients died. Thirty-three of the patients who died were aged over 65  years (70%), indicating that fatality was higher in elderly patients. Most of  those who died had at least one comorbidity. Of the 101 patients who initiated  favipiravir within ≤3 days of hospitalization, 17 died (17%). Of the 79 patients  who initiated favipiravir after >3 days of hospitalization, 30 died (38%) (P =  0.002). CONCLUSION: We found that initiation of favipiravir within the first 72 h  after the onset of disease symptoms reduced fatality in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine (HQ), and darunavir/ritonavir are widely prescribed as an oral treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection despite their uncertainty of clinical  benefit. The objective is to determine the safety and the efficacies of two  treatment regimens against SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted an  open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial to compare the efficacy between a  3-day course of once-daily high-dose oral ivermectin plus zinc sulfate (Group A)  and a combination of HQ, darunavir/ritonavir, and zinc sulfate (HQ +  antiretroviral, Group B) for 5 days in asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.  The study period was between December 2020 and April 2021. RESULTS: Overall, 113  patients were randomized and analyzed (57 patients in Group A and 56 patients in  Group B). The median duration to achieve the virological outcome of either  undetected or cycle threshold (Ct) for N gene of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time  polymerase chain reaction was 6 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3-6.7)  versus 7 days (95% CI: 5.4-8.6) in Group A and Group B, respectively (P = 0.419)  in the modified intention-to-treat population. All patients were discharged from  hospital quarantine as planned. Two patients in Group A and one patient in Group  B were considered clinically worsening and received 10 days of favipiravir  treatment. There was no serious adverse event found in both groups. CONCLUSION:  We demonstrated that both treatment regimens were safe, but both treatment  regimens had no virological or clinical benefit. Based on this result and current  data, there is no supporting evidence for the clinical benefit of ivermectin for  coronavirus-19.

AB  - Favipiravir (T-705), used against influenza viruses, is approved for emergency use in many countries for the treatment of COVID-19. The frequent adverse effects  of favipiravir are related with the gastrointestinal system, however, studies  suggest a positive association of favipiravir on QTc prolongation, which can  cause cardiotoxicity. Also, there are reports of skin reactions such as  angioedema due to favipiravir. Despite the several adverse effects, studies  examining the drug's effects at the molecular level are insufficient, e.g., the  genotoxic and oxidative stress-inducing effects of favipiravir, which are among  the primary mechanisms of drug-induced toxicity. The cytotoxicity of favipiravir  was analyzed with the measurement of the ATP content in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and  CCD-1079Sk skin fibroblasts. The ATP level decreased starting from 200 µM. The  inhibitory effect on the mitochondrial electron transport chain enzymes complex I  and complex V was also evaluated where favipiravir showed significant enzyme  inhibitory effects in the highest concentration studied. A molecular docking  study evaluating the interaction between favipiravir-RTP and mitochondrial DNA  polymerase (POLG1) was done. The relationship of favipiravir with oxidative  stress was examined by measuring glutathione (GSH) and protein carbonyl levels  which were observed higher after drug treatment compared to the control group.  The genotoxicity study was done using the Comet assay and increase in DNA tail  has been detected. Furthermore, 8-OHdG levels were measured higher in favipiravir  treated cells indicating oxidative DNA damage. Favipiravir induced oxidative  stress leading to DNA damage in cardiomyoblast cells and fibroblastic skin cells.  Oxidative stress and DNA damage might eventually lead to organ-specific damage  such as cardiotoxicity and dermal toxicity. Considering the increased use of  favipiravir in recent years, and that oxidative stress and genotoxicity are two  important indicators of drug-induced toxicity, the obtained results are worth  attention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Favipiravir, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor (RdRp), is a broad-spectrum oral antiviral agent approved in India under emergency use  authorization, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease  (COVID-19). The present study was planned to evaluate the effectiveness and  safety of favipiravir in real-world clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  This was a multicentric, retrospective, single-arm study conducted across four  centres in India, after obtaining permission from the independent ethics  committee. Medical records were analysed to evaluate effectiveness and safety of  patients who were prescribed favipiravir. RESULTS: The medical records of a total  of 360 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 358 of them available for the  final analysis. Males made up 58.46% of the study population. The average age of  enrolled patients was 51.80 ± 16.45 years. The most common symptoms were fever,  cough, and myalgia-fatigue. The median time to clinical cure and fever relief was  five and four days, respectively. The average length of stay in the hospital was  six days. In total, 8% of the patients experienced adverse events. Hepatic enzyme  elevation, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, headache, fatigue, and giddiness were  the common symptoms. CONCLUSION: In our real-world study, favipiravir was found  to have a clinical cure rate of more than 90% in mild-to-moderate COVID-19  patients. This supports the use of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19.  Favipiravir was well tolerated, with only minimal side effects, which were  transient in nature.

AB  - In this paper, we studied the in silico interaction of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) human receptor with two bioactive compounds, i.e., nicotine and  caffeine, via molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The simulations reveal the  efficient blocking of ACE2 by caffeine and nicotine in the exposure to the spike  (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We  have selected the two most important active sites of ACE2-S protein, i.e., 6LZG  and 6VW1, which are critically responsible in the interaction of S protein to the  receptor and thus, we investigated their interaction with nicotine and caffeine  through MD simulations. Caffeine and nicotine are interesting structures for  interactions because of their similar structure to the candidate antiviral drugs.  Our results reveal that caffeine or nicotine in a specific molar ratio to 6LZG  shows a very strong interaction and indicate that caffeine is more efficient in  the interaction with 6LZG and further blocking of this site against S protein  binding. Further, we investigated the interaction of ACE2 receptor- S protein  with nicotine or caffeine when mixed with candidate or approved antiviral drugs  for SARS-CoV-2 therapy. Our MD simulations suggest that the combination of  caffeine with ribavirin shows a stronger interaction with 6VW1, while in case of  favipiravir+nicotine, 6LZG shows potent efficacy of these interaction, proposing  the potent efficacy of these combinations for blocking ACE2 receptor against  SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Pandemic new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virus has increased throughout the world. There is no effective treatment against this  virus until now. Since its appearance in Wuhan, China in December 2019,  SARS-CoV-2 becomes the largest challenge the world is opposite today, including  the discovery of an antiviral drug for this virus. Several viral proteins have  been prioritized as SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug targets, among them the papain-like  protease (PLpro) and the main protease (Mpro). Inhibition of these proteases  would target viral replication, viral maturation and suppression of host innate  immune responses. Potential candidates have been identified to show inhibitory  effects against Mpro, both in biochemical assays and viral replication in cells.  There are different molecules such as lopinavir and favipiravir considerably  inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro. Different studies have shown that  structurally improved favipiravir and other similar compounds can inhibit  SARS-CoV-2 main protease. In this work, we study the interactions between  favipiravir with Mg(12)O(12) and Zn(12)O(12) nanoclusters by density functional  theory (DFT) and quantum mechanics atoms in molecules (QMAIM) methods to  summarize the ability to load favipiravir onto Mg(12)O(12) and Zn(12)O(12)  nanoclusters. Favipiravir-Mg(12)O(12) and favipiravir-Zn(12)O(12) lowest  structures complexes were chosen to dock inside the SARS-CoV-2 main protease by  molecular docking study. The molecular docking analysis revealed that the binding  affinity of Mg(12)O(12) and Zn(12)O(12) nanoclusters inside the Mpro receptor is  larger than that of favipiravir. Also, the loading of favipiravir on the surface  of Mg(12)O(12) and Zn(12)O(12) nanoclusters increased the binding affinity  against the Mpro receptor. Subsequently, 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation of  the favipiravir-Mg(12)O(12), and favipiravir-Zn(12)O(12) docked inside the Mpro  complexes established that favipiravir-Mg(12)O(12), forms the most stable complex  with the Mpro. Further molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area  (MMPBSA) analyses using the MD trajectories also demonstrated the higher binding  affinity of favipiravir-Mg(12)O(12) inside the Mpro. In summary, this study  demonstrates a new way to characterize leads for novel anti-viral drugs against  SARS-CoV-2, by improving the drug ability of favipiravir via loading it on  Mg(12)O(12) and Zn(12)O(12) nanoclusters.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged as an unprecedented challenge to discover effective drugs for its prevention and cure.  Hyperinflammation-induced lung damage is one of the poor prognostic indicators  causing a higher rate of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients.  Favipiravir, an antiviral drug, is being used for COVID-19 treatment, and we  currently have limited information regarding its efficacy and safety. Thus, the  present study was undertaken to evaluate the adverse drug events (ADEs) reported  in the WHO pharmacovigilance database. METHODS: This study analyzed all suspected  ADEs related to favipiravir reported from 2015. The reports were analyzed based  on age, gender, and seriousness of ADEs at the System Organ Classification (SOC)  level and the individual Preferred Term (PT) level. RESULTS: This study is based  on 194 ADEs reported from 93 patients. Most frequent ADEs suspected to be caused  by the favipiravir included increased hepatic enzymes, nausea and vomiting,  tachycardia, and diarrhea. Severe and fatal ADEs occurred more frequently in men  and those over the age of 64 years. Blood and lymphatic disorders, cardiac  disorders, hepatobiliary disorders, injury poisoning, and procedural  complications were more common manifestations of severe ADEs. CONCLUSION: This  study revealed that favipiravir appears to be a relatively safe drug. An  undiscovered anti-inflammatory activity of favipiravir may explain the  improvement in critically ill patients and reduce inflammatory markers.  Currently, the data is based on very few patients. A more detailed assessment of  the uncommon ADEs needs to be analyzed when more information will be available.

AB  - A novel and sensitive voltammetric nanosensor was developed for the first time for trace level monitoring of favipiravir based on gold/silver core-shell  nanoparticles (Au@Ag CSNPs) with conductive polymer poly (3,4-ethylene  dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and functionalized multi carbon  nanotubes (F-MWCNTs) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The formation of Au@Ag  CSNPs/PEDOT:PSS/F-MWCNT composite was confirmed by various analytical techniques,  including X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis),  transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy  (EDX), and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Under the optimized  conditions and at a typical working potential of + 1.23 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the  Au@Ag CSNPs/PEDOT:PSS/F-MWCNT/GCE revealed linear quantitative ranges from 0.005  to 0.009 and 0.009 to 1.95 µM with a limit of detection 0.46 nM (S/N = 3) with  acceptable relative standard deviations (1.1-4.9 %) for pharmaceutical  formulations, urine, and human plasma samples without applying any sample  pretreatment (1.12-4.93%). The interference effect of antiviral drugs, biological  compounds, and amino acids was negligible, and the sensing system demonstrated  outstanding reproducibility, repeatability, stability, and reusability. The  findings revealed that this assay strategy has promising applications in  diagnosing FAV in clinical samples, which could be attributed to the large  surface area on active sites and high conductivity of bimetallic nanocomposite.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Favipiravir is a ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) inhibitor antiviral agent used in the treatment of  coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we investigated the changes  in serum transaminase levels of patients and the relationship between serum  transaminase elevation with mortality in patients who were hospitalized with the  diagnosis of COVID-19 and received favipiravir treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  454 patients who received favipiravir and 113 patients who did not receive  favipiravir were evaluated. Serum transaminase levels of the patients were  compared at baseline and after five days of treatment, and the relationship  between serum transaminase elevation and mortality was investigated. RESULTS: No  significant aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  elevation was detected due to favipiravir treatment. AST elevation was found,  respectively, as 133 (29.3%), 32 (28.3%) (p=0.100), ALT elevation as 112 (24.7%),  35 (29.3%) (p=0.100) in the groups receiving and not receiving favipiravir. High  AST level was found as a risk factor for mortality in all patient  groups (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant elevation  in serum transaminase levels due to favipiravir use in patients hospitalized for  COVID-19. A high level of AST is a significant risk factor to show mortality and  intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several randomized controlled trials have compared the effectiveness of favipiravir with that of placebo. However, evidence regarding  its effect on nonsevere, early-stage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains  insufficient. METHODS: We used the COVID-19 Registry Japan, a nationwide registry  of inpatients with COVID-19, for evaluating the effectiveness of favipiravir on  patients with nonsevere, early-stage COVID-19. Eligible patients, who did not  need supplementary oxygen therapy at admission, were classified according to two  regimens (starting favipiravir therapy within 4 days from admission vs. no  favipiravir during hospitalization) and were then compared using a three-step  method (cloning, censoring, and weighting). The primary outcome was supplementary  oxygen requirement during hospitalization, and the secondary outcomes were the  need for invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  (IMV/ECMO) and overall mortality at 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 7654 cases were  analyzed. The "start favipiravir" regimen did not show substantial differences in  the primary outcome [hazard ratio 0.825, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.657-1.04,  p = 0.098] and both of the secondary outcomes [need for IMV/ECMO and overall  30-day mortality, hazard ratio 1.02 (95% CI 0.649-1.60) and 0.869 (95% CI  0.519-1.46), p = 0.929 and 0.594, respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: In this large  cohort from a COVID-19 registry, favipiravir was not associated with a positive  effect on the clinical outcome on patients with nonsevere, early-stage COVID-19,  suggesting that it is not an essential drug for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - The following systematic review and meta-analysis compile the current data regarding human controlled COVID-19 treatment trials. An electronic search of the  literature compiled studies pertaining to human controlled treatment trials with  COVID-19. Medications assessed included lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol,  hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, favipiravir, heparin, and dexamethasone.  Statistical analyses were performed for common viral clearance endpoints whenever  possible. Lopinavir/ritonavir showed no significant effect on viral clearance for  COVID-19 cases (OR 0.95 [95% CI 0.50-1.83]). Hydroxychloroquine also showed no  significant effect on COVID-19 viral clearance rates (OR 2.16 [95% CI  0.80-5.84]). Arbidol showed no 7-day (OR 1.63 [95% CI 0.76-3.50]) or 14-day viral  (OR 5.37 [95% CI 0.35-83.30]) clearance difference compared to  lopinavir/ritonavir. Review of literature showed no significant clinical  improvement with lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, hydroxychloroquine, or remdesivir.  Tocilizumab showed mixed results regarding survival. Favipiravir showed quicker  symptom improvement compared to lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol. Heparin and  dexamethasone showed improvement with severe COVID-19 cases requiring  supplemental oxygenation. Current medications do not show significant effect on  COVID-19 viral clearance rates. Tocilizumab showed mixed results regarding  survival. Favipiravir shows favorable results compared to other tested  medications. Heparin and dexamethasone show benefit especially for severe  COVID-19 cases.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a worldwide pandemic, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). At this moment in time,  there are no specific therapeutics available to combat COVID-19. Drug repurposing  and identification of naturally available bioactive molecules to target  SARS-CoV-2 are among the key strategies to tackle the notorious virus. The enzyme  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) performs a pivotal role in replicating the  virus. RdRp is a prime target for Remdesivir and other nucleotides analog-based  antiviral drugs. In this study, we showed three bioactive molecules from tea  (epicatechin-3,5-di-O-gallate, epigallocatechin-3,5-di-O-gallate, and  epigallocatechin-3,4-di-O-gallate) that showed better interaction with critical  residues present at the catalytic center and the NTP entry channel of RdRp than  antiviral drugs Remdesivir and Favipiravir. Our computational approach to  identify these molecules included molecular docking studies, followed by robust  molecular dynamics simulations. All the three molecules are readily available in  tea and could be made accessible along with other medications to treat COVID-19  patients. However, these results require validation by further in vitro and in  vivo studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Well tolerated antivirals administered early in the course of COVID-19 infection when the viremia is highest could prevent progression to  severe disease. Favipiravir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in vitro with  evidence of clinical benefit in open label trials. Placebo controlled studies of  people with early symptomatic COVID-19 with regular assessments of SARS-CoV-2  viral load can determine if it has an antiviral effect and improves clinical  outcomes. METHODS: People with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and 5 days or less of  symptoms were randomised 1:1 to favipiravir 1800 mg on day 1, then 800 mg twice  daily or matched placebo for 14 days. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was quantitated from  second daily self-collected nose-throat swabs while receiving study drug. The  primary endpoint was time to virological cure defined as 2 successive swabs  negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR and secondary outcomes were progression of disease  severity, symptom resolution and safety. FINDINGS: Between 31 July 2020 and 19  September 2021, 200 people were enrolled (199 in the community, 1 in hospital)  with 190 receiving one or more doses of drug (modified intention to treat [mITT]  population). There was no difference in time to virological cure (Log-rank p=0.6  comparing Kaplan Meier curves), progression to hospitalisation (14 favipiravir, 9  placebo; p=0.38), time to symptom resolution (cough, fever, sore throat) and  there were no deaths. 51 people related an adverse event that was possibly drug  related, but these were evenly distributed (n=24 favipiravir, n=27 placebo).  Sensitivity analyses where the definition of virological cure was changed to: a  single negative PCR, exclude datapoints based on the presence or absence of human  DNA in the swab, a SARS-CoV-2 viral load < 300 copies/mL being considered  negative all demonstrated no difference between arms. INTERPRETATION: Favipiravir  does not improve the time to virological cure or clinical outcomes and shows no  evidence of an antiviral effect when treating early symptomatic COVID-19  infection. FUNDING: The study was supported in part by grants from the  Commonwealth Bank Australia, the Lord Mayor's Charitable Foundation, Melbourne  Australia and the Orloff Family Charitable Trust, Melbourne, Australia. JHM is  supported by the Medical Research Future Fund, AYP, JT are supported by the  Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of favipiravir as a treatment for COVID-19 is unclear, with discrepant activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro , concerns about teratogenicity  and pill burden, and an unknown optimal dose. In Vero-E6 cells, high  concentrations are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. The purpose of this  analysis was to use available data to simulate intracellular pharmacokinetics of  favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5⍰-triphosphate (FAVI-RTP) to better understand the  putative applicability as a COVID-19 intervention. METHODS: Previously published  in vitro data for the intracellular production and elimination of FAVI- RTP in  MDCK cells incubated with parent favipiravir was fitted with a mathematical model  to describe the time course of intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations as a  function of incubation concentration of parent favipiravir. Parameter estimates  from this model fitting were then combined with a previously published population  PK model for the plasma exposure of parent favipiravir in Chinese patients with  severe influenza (the modelled free plasma concentration of favipiravir  substituting for in vitro incubation concentration) to predict the human  intracellular FAVI-RTP pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: In vitro FAVI-RTP data was  adequately described as a function of in vitro incubation media concentrations of  parent favipiravir with an empirical model, noting that the model simplifies and  consolidates various processes and is used under various assumptions and within  certain limits. Parameter estimates from the fittings to in vitro data predict a  flatter dynamic range of peak to trough for intracellular FAVI-RTP when driven by  a predicted free plasma concentration profile. CONCLUSION: This modelling  approach has several important limitations that are discussed in the main text of  the manuscript. However, the simulations indicate that despite rapid clearance of  the parent drug from plasma, sufficient intracellular FAVI-RTP may be maintained  across the dosing interval because of its long intracellular half-life.  Population average intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations are estimated to  maintain the Km for the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase for 3 days following 800 mg BID  dosing and 9 days following 1200 mg BID dosing after a 1600 mg BID loading dose  on day 1. Further evaluation of favipiravir as part of antiviral combinations for  SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.

AB  - The emergence of fast-spreading SARS-CoV-2 mutants has sparked a new phase of COVID-19 pandemic. There is a dire necessity for antivirals targeting highly  conserved genomic domains on SARS-CoV-2 that are less prone to mutation. The  nsp12, also known as the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), the core component  of 'SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex', is a potential well-conserved  druggable antiviral target. Several FDA-approved RdRp 'nucleotide analog  inhibitors (NAIs)' such as remdesivir, have been repurposed to treat COVID-19  infections. The NAIs target RdRp protein translation and competitively block the  nucleotide insertion into the RNA chain, resulting in the inhibition of viral  replication. However, the replication proofreading function of nsp14-ExoN could  provide resistance to SARS-CoV-2 against many NAIs. Conversely, the  'non-nucleoside analog inhibitors (NNAIs)' bind to allosteric sites on viral  polymerase surface, change the redox state; thereby, exert antiviral activity by  altering interactions between the enzyme substrate and active core catalytic site  of the RdRp. NNAIs neither require metabolic activation (unlike NAIs) nor compete  with intracellular pool of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) for anti-RdRp  activity. The NNAIs from phytonutrient origin are potential antiviral candidates  compared to their synthetic counterparts. Several in-silico studies reported the  antiviral spectrum of natural phytonutrient-NNAIs such as Suramin, Silibinin  (flavonolignan), Theaflavin (tea polyphenol), Baicalein  (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone), Corilagin (gallotannin), Hesperidin (citrus  bioflavonoid), Lycorine (pyrrolidine alkaloid), with superior redox  characteristics (free binding energy, hydrogen-bonds, etc.) than antiviral drugs  (i.e. remdesivir, favipiravir). These phytonutrient-NNAIs also exert  anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and cardioprotective functions,  with multifunctional therapeutic benefits in the clinical management of COVID-19.

AB  - In coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, a cytokine storm resulting from an excessive inflammatory response to the viral infection is thought to play a role  in the exacerbation of the pneumonia and its prognosis. Favipiravir and  ciclesonide are not effective in the inhibition of the cytokine storm. In this  case report, we describe the experience of tocilizumab administration and  polymyxin B immobilized fiber direct hemoperfusion in severe coronavirus disease  2019 pneumonia patient. A 52-year-old man presented with fever and dyspnea and  was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia based on a polymerase chain  reaction test. Mechanical ventilation and favipiravir administration were started  for respiratory failure. However, favipiravir could not be continued due to  hepatic dysfunction. Consequently, tocilizumab was administered, and continuous  hemodiafiltration and endotoxin adsorption therapy (polymyxin B immobilized fiber  direct hemoperfusion) were performed for acute renal failure. C-reactive protein  decreased from 44 to 3.52 mg/dL, and the patient's respiratory status improved  over time, enabling mechanical ventilation to be withdrawn. This case indicates  that adding polymyxin B immobilized fiber direct hemoperfusion to tocilizumab  administration may further increase efficacy in coronavirus disease 2019  treatment; however, more case-control studies are needed.

AB  - In the present study, we have done a comparative study on the efficacy of some currently used repurposed drugs: Oseltamivir (O), Favipiravir (F) and  Hydroxychloroquine (H) in individual and in their combinational mode against  CoV-2 infections. The ADME analysis has helped us to identify the inhibitory  possibility of the tested drugs towards receptor 3CL(pro) protein of SARS-CoV-2.  Various thermodynamical parameters obtained from Molecular Docking, Molecular  dynamics (MD) and MMPBSA simulations like binding affinity, potential energy  (E(pot)), RMSD, RMSF, SASA energy, interaction energies, Gibbs free energy  (ΔG(bind)) etc. also helped us to verify the effectivity of mentioned drugs  against CoV-2 protease.

AB  - In an emergency, drug repurposing is the best alternative option against newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.  However, several bioactive natural products have shown potential against  SARS-CoV-2 in recent studies. The present study selected sixty-eight  broad-spectrum antiviral marine terpenoids and performed molecular docking  against two novel SARS-CoV-2 enzymes (main protease or M(pro) or 3CL(pro)) and  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In addition, the present study analysed the  physiochemical-toxicity-pharmacokinetic profile, structural activity  relationship, and phylogenetic tree with various computational tools to select  the 'lead' candidate. The genomic diversity study with multiple sequence analyses  and phylogenetic tree confirmed that the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 strain was up  to 96% structurally similar to existing CoV-strains. Furthermore, the  anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency based on a protein-ligand docking score (kcal/mol)  exposed that the marine terpenoid brevione F (-8.4) and stachyflin (-8.4)  exhibited similar activity with the reference antiviral drugs lopinavir (-8.4)  and darunavir (-7.5) against the target SARS-CoV-M(pro). Similarly, marine  terpenoids such as xiamycin (-9.3), thyrsiferol (-9.2), liouvilloside B (-8.9),  liouvilloside A (-8.8), and stachyflin (-8.7) exhibited comparatively higher  docking scores than the referral drug remdesivir (-7.4), and favipiravir (-5.7)  against the target SARS-CoV-2-RdRp. The above in silico investigations concluded  that stachyflin is the most 'lead' candidate with the most potential against  SARS-CoV-2. Previously, stachyflin also exhibited potential activity against  HSV-1 and CoV-A59 within IC(50), 0.16-0.82 µM. Therefore, some additional  pharmacological studies are needed to develop 'stachyflin' as a drug against  SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Favipiravir has demonstrated efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in several preliminary studies. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  favipiravir for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in outpatients and  hospitalized patients. We conducted an open-label, randomized, active-controlled  trial of a generic form of favipiravir in patients with COVID-19 confirmed by  PCR-test. Eligible patients (18-60 years) after stratification were randomly  assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive either favipiravir (1800 mg BID on day 1,  followed by 800 mg BID for up to 9 days), or standard of care (SOC) treatment  (umifenovir + intranasal interferon alpha-2b, or hydroxychloroquine) for up to 10  days. The co-primary outcomes were the time to clinical improvement and the time  to viral clearance. Among 190 patients assessed for eligibility 168 were  randomized to favipiravir (n=112) or to SOC (n=56) group. The median time to  clinical improvement was 6.0 days (IQR 4.0; 9.3) in the favipiravir group and  10.0 (IQR 5.0; 21.0) days in the SOC group; the median difference was 4 days (HR  1.63; 95% CI 1.14-2.34; P=0.007). The statistically significant difference in the  median time to viral clearance was observed only for hospitalized patients: 3.0  (IQR 3.0; 3.0) days in the favipiravir group vs. 5.0 (IQR 4.5; 5.5) days in the  SOC group (HR 2.11; 95% CI 1.04-4.31; P=0.038). The rate of viral elimination on  Day 5 in the favipiravir group was significantly higher than in SOC group: 81.2%  vs. 67.9% (RR 1.22; 05% CI 1.00-1.48; P=0.022). The rate of clinical improvement  on Day 7 in the favipiravir group was 1.5-fold higher than in SOC group: 52.7%  vs. 35.8% (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.02-2.22; P=0.020). Favipiravir was well-tolerated  and the most common adverse reactions were asymptomatic hyperuricemia, transient  elevation of ALT & AST, and mild gastrointestinal disorders. Favipiravir was  superior to the SOC in shortening the time to clinical improvement in patients  with mild to moderate COVID-19.

AB  - As per date, around 20 million COVID-19 cases reported from across the globe due to a tiny 125 nm sized virus: SARS-CoV-2 which has created a pandemic and left an  unforgettable impact on our world. Besides vaccine, medical community is in a  race to identify an effective drug, which can fight against this disease  effectively. Favipiravir (F) has recently attracted too much attention as an  effective repurposed drug against COVID-19. In the present study, the pertinency  of F has been tested as an antiviral option against viral protease (3CL(pro)) of  SARS-CoV-2 with the help of density functional theory (DFT) and MD Simulation.  Different electronic properties of F such as atomic charges, molecular  electrostatic properties (MEP), chemical reactivity and absorption analysis have  been studied by DFT. In order to understand the interaction and stability of  inhibitor F against viral protease, molecular docking and MD simulation have been  performed. Various output like interaction energies, number of intermolecular  hydrogen bonding, binding energy etc. have established the elucidate role of F  for the management of CoV-2 virus for which there is no approved therapies till  now. Our findings highlighted the need to further evaluate F as a potential  antiviral against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide. As our understanding of the disease is evolving, our approach to the  patient management is also changing swiftly. Available new evidence is helping us  take radical decisions in COVID-19 management. We searched for inclusion of the  published literature on treatment of COVID-19 from around the globe. All relevant  evidences available till the time of submission of this article were briefly  discussed. Once advised as blanket therapy for all patients, recent reports of  hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin indicated no potential benefit  and use of such combination may increase the risk of arrhythmias. Clinical  evidence with newer antivirals such as remdesivir and favipiravir is promising  that can hasten the patient recovery and reduce the mortality. With steroids,  evidence is much clear in that it should be used in low dose and for short period  not extending beyond 7 days in moderate to severe hospitalized patients.  Low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated in all hospitalized COVID-19  patients and dose should be based on the coagulation profile and risk of  thromboembolism. Immunomodulatory drugs such tocilizumab may be considered for  severe and critically ill patients to improve the outcomes. Though ulinastatin  can be a potential alternative immunomodulator, there is lack of clinical  evidence on its usage in COVID-19. Convalescent plasma therapy can be potentially  lifesaving in critically ill patients. However, there is need to generate further  evidence with various such therapies. Though availability of a potent vaccine is  awaited, current treatment of COVID-19 is based on available therapies, which is  guided by the evidence. In this review, we discuss the potential treatments  available around the globe with current evidence on each of such treatments.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in the newborn is a difficult-to-treat condition. Early clinical signs of pneumonia are nonspecific and present as  respiratory distress of varying severity, and tachypnea is a predominant clinical  sign. A 47-day-old, asymptomatic male newborn of coronavirus disease 2019  infected mother tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 by reverse  transcription polymerase chain reaction. During hospitalization, he developed  progressive tachypnea, tachycardia, and chest radiography abnormalities, and was  diagnosed as coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. He was treated with favipiravir,  hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir. A favipiravir-based regimen may be  the drug of choice for coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in the newborn.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite vaccination, many remain vulnerable to COVID-19 and its complications. Oral antivirals to prevent COVID-19 progression are vital. Based  upon perceived potency and clinical efficacy, favipiravir is widely used to treat  COVID-19. Evidence from large randomized controlled trials (RCT) is lacking.  METHODS: In this multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled RCT, adults with  early mild-to-moderate COVID-19 were 1:1 randomized to favipiravir or placebo.  The study evaluated time to sustained clinical recovery (TT-SCR), COVID-19  progression, and cessation of viral shedding. RESULTS: Of 1187 analyzed patients  across 40 centers, 83.3% were Hispanic, 89.0% unvaccinated, 70.3% SARS-CoV-2  seronegative, and 77.8% had risk factors for COVID-19 progression. The median  time from symptom presentation and from positive test to randomization was three  and two days, respectively. There was no difference in TT-SCR (median of 7 days  for both groups; p = 0.80), COVID-19 progression [11 patients each (1.9% vs.  1.8%); p = 0.96], time to undetectable virus [median = 6 days, 95% CI (6-8) vs. 7  days, 95% CI (6-9)], or in undetectable virus by end of therapy (73.4% vs. 72.3%;  p = 0.94). Outcomes were consistent across the analyzed sub-groups. Adverse  events were observed in 13.8% and 14.8% of favipiravir-treated and  placebo-treated subjects, respectively. Uric acid elevation was more frequent  among favipiravir-treated subjects (19.9% vs. 2.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir was  well tolerated but lacked efficacy in TT-SCR, progression to severe COVID-19, or  cessation of viral shedding and should not be used to treat patients with  COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, an emerged strain of corona virus family became almost serious health concern worldwide. Despite vaccines availability, reports suggest  the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection even in a vaccinated population. With  frequent evolution and expected multiple COVID-19 waves, improved preventive,  diagnostic, and treatment measures are required. In recent times, phytochemicals  have gained attention due to their therapeutic characteristics and are suggested  as alternative and complementary treatments for infectious diseases. This present  study aimed to identify potential inhibitors against reported protein targets of  SARS-CoV-2. METHODOLOGY: We computationally investigated potential SARS-CoV-2  protein targets from the literature and collected druggable phytochemicals from  Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry and Therapeutics (IMPPAT) database.  Further, we implemented a systematic workflow of molecular docking, dynamic  simulations and generalized born surface area free-energy calculations (MM-GBSA).  RESULTS: Extensive literature search and assessment of 1508 articles identifies  13 potential SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. We screened 501 druggable phytochemicals  with proven biological activities. Analysis of 6513(501 *13) docked  phytochemicals complex, 26 were efficient against SARS-CoV-2. Amongst,  4,8-dihydroxysesamin and arboreal from Gmelina arborea were ranked potential  against most of the targets with binding energy ranging between - 10.7 to  - 8.2 kcal/mol. Additionally, comparative docking with known drugs such as  arbidol (-6.6 to -5.1 kcal/mol), favipiravir (-5.5 to -4.5 kcal/mol),  hydroxychloroquine (-6.5 to -5.1 kcal/mol), and remedesivir (-8.0 to  -5.3 kcal/mol) revealed equal/less affinity than 4,8-dihydroxysesamin and  arboreal. Interestingly, the nucleocapsid target was found commonly inhibited by  4,8-dihydroxysesamin and arboreal. Molecular dynamic simulation and Molecular  mechanics generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA)calculations reflect that both  the compounds possess high inhibiting potential against SARS-CoV-2 including the  recently emerged Omicron variant (B.1.1.529). CONCLUSION: Overall our study  imparts the usage of phytochemicals as antiviral agents for SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Additional in vitro and in vivo testing of these phytochemicals is required to  confirm their potency.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease, commonly called COVID-19, has already killed millions of lives. Our study aimed to identify a safe and right drug for  the management of such globally threatened COVID-19. METHODS: This preliminary  double-blinded randomized controlled trial was done among 57 hospitalized  COVID-19 patients in the early stage of their illness. Of them, 29 patients  received Favipiravir (FVP) and the remaining 28 patients received a placebo under  the standard of care. Among the patients, 4 from Favipiravir (FVP) group and 3  from the placebo group were discontinued. The patients were observed regularly  for a period of 10 days. RESULT: In our study, the FVP treated group showed  accelerated viral clearance compared to the placebo-treated group. Assessment of  chest X-ray showed remarkable improvement of pheumonia patient in group A  compared to Group B. Hematological and Biochemical parameters such as total WBC  count, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were examined. No significant differences  in the hematological parameters such as WBC count, neutrophil and lymphocyte  counts in Group A and Group B patients. Liver transaminases levels were also  stable in FVP treated group (average ALT ranges 39.4-46.2; AST 28.2-32.8).  CONCLUSION: The drug Favipiravir displayed remarkable improvements in the  clinical conditions and recovery of COVID-19 patients at the early stages of  their infections.

AB  - On 11 March 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2  (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes  COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread  rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through  virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no  established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of  COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have  been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there  has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently  tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have  been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous  high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012  Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the  identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the  emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology  techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of  the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest  potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy  considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care  professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the  reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized  large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.

AB  - We report the first two cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) who were receiving intensive care including favipiravir, and were clinically diagnosed  with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) to focus attention on NMS in COVID-19  management. Case 1: A 46-year-old-man with acute respiratory distress syndrome  (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 infection was being administered favipiravir. Fentanyl,  propofol, and rocuronium were also given. On day 3, midazolam administration was  initiated for deep sedation. On day 5, his high body temperature increased to  41.2 °C, creatine kinase level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea,  altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS was suspected, and supportive therapy  was initiated. High-grade fever persisted for 4 days and subsided on day 9. Case  2: A 44-year-old-man with ARDS caused by COVID-19 infection was being treated  with favipiravir. On day 5, risperidone was started for delirium. On day 7, his  body temperature suddenly increased to 40.8 °C, his CK level elevated, and he  developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS  diagnosis was confirmed, and both, favipiravir and risperidone were discontinued  on day 8. On the same day, his CK levels decreased, and his body temperature  normalized on day 9. Patients with COVID-19 infection frequently require deep  sedation and develop delirium; therefore, more attention should be paid to the  development of NMS in patients who are being administered such causative agents.  The mechanism underlying the occurrence of NMS in COVID-19 patients treated with  favipiravir remains unknown. Therefore, careful consideration of NMS development  is necessary in the management of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is being increasingly recognized as a severe complication that contributes to poor  prognoses among patients with COVID-19. However, little is known regarding the  clinical course of CAPA with hematological malignancies, especially after  allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A 29-year-old woman  was diagnosed with proven CAPA with an Aspergillus fumigatus identified by  cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage and lung biopsy four years after  haploidentical HSCT for acute myelogenous leukemia. She had been taking oral  prednisolone for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome that developed after HSCT.  Although prolonged RT-PCR positivity for SARS-CoV-2 (133 days after the onset of  COVID-19) without shedding of viable virus was observed, the COVID-19 was treated  with favipiravir, remdesivir, dexamethasone, and enoxaparin. However, the CAPA  did not respond to combination therapy, which included triazole (voriconazole,  itraconazole, posaconazole) and echinocandin (caspofungin, micafungin), even  though the Aspergillus fumigatus isolate was found to be susceptible to these  agents in vitro. Nevertheless, a total of 16 weeks of liposomal amphotericin B  (L-AMB) therapy led to a favorable response, and the patient was discharged from  the hospital on day 213. This case provided essential experience of CAPA treated  with L-AMB in a recipient with chronic respiratory disease after HSCT.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antiviral drugs have shown limited effectiveness in treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to assess the effects  of a favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine combination on treating  moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: An investigator-initiated,  multicenter, open-label, randomized trial at nine hospitals. Eligible patients  were adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 defined as oxygen saturation  (SaO(2)) of ≤ 94% while breathing ambient air or significant clinical symptoms  with chest x-ray changes requiring hospital admission. Randomization was in a 1:1  ratio to receive standard care (control group) or standard care plus favipiravir  and hydroxychloroquine. The primary outcome was time to clinical improvement of  two points (from the status at randomization) on a seven-category ordinal scale  or live discharge from the hospital within 14 days. Analyses were done in an  intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: From May 2020 to Jan 2021, 254 patients  were enrolled; 129 were assigned to standard of care and 125 to the treatment.  The mean age was 52 (± 13) years, and 103 (41%) were women. At randomization, six  patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation, 229 (90.15%) were requiring  supplemental oxygen only (with or without non-invasive ventilation), and 19  (7.48%) were receiving neither. The time to clinical improvement was not  significantly different between the groups: median of 9 days in the treatment  group and 7 days in the control group (HR: 0.845; 95% CI 0.617-1.157;  p-value = 0.29). The 28-day mortality was not significantly different between the  groups (7.63% treatment) vs. (10.32% control); p-value = 0.45. The most prevalent  adverse events were headache, elevation in ALT, and the prolonged QTc interval in  the treatment group. CONCLUSION: The combination of favipiravir and  hydroxychloroquine did not result in a statistically significant clinical benefit  in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:  ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04392973).

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an ongoing viral pandemic produced by SARS-CoV-2. In light of in vitro efficacy, several medications were repurposed for its  management. During clinical use, many of these medications produced inconsistent  results or had varying limitations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this literature  review is to explain the variable efficacy or limitations of Lopinavir/Ritonavir,  Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, and Favipiravir in clinical settings. METHOD: A  study of the literature on the pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK),  safety profile, and clinical trials through academic databases using relevant  search terms. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: The efficacy of an antiviral drug against  COVID-19 is associated with its ability to achieve therapeutic concentration in  the lung and intestinal tissues. This efficacy depends on the PK properties,  particularly protein binding, volume of distribution, and half-life. The PK and  PD of the model drugs need to be integrated to predict their limitations.  CONCLUSION: Current antiviral drugs have varying pharmacological constraints that  may associate with limited efficacy, especially in severe COVID-19 patients, or  safety concerns.

AB  - Design and development of effective anti-virals in combating CoVid-19 is a great challenge worldwide. Known drugs such as chloroquine, lopinavir, favipiravir and  remdesivir are used in the management of CoVid - 19. It is known that Ivermectin  and remdesivir both are effective against filoviruses, paramyxo viruses.  Available data also shows that ivermectin and remedesivir repress the replication  of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we document the potential use of ivermectin and remdesivir  in the management of CoVid -19.

Laboratory  findings showed pancytopenia and an elevated creatinine level. Cyclosporine and  mycophenolate mofetil were discontinued, and the patient received only  everolimus. As he was immunosuppressed and had atypical symptoms during the  COVID-19 pandemic, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing was  performed, which yielded a positive result. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine and  favipiravir were initiated. Although the patient suffered from acute renal  failure, his condition showed an improvement after hydration plus a five-day  antiviral treatment and, then, treatment was stopped. His COVID-19 test was  negative after 10 days of follow-up and treatment, and he was discharged with  cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic poses a fundamental challenge to global health. Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, great efforts have been made to identify antiviral  strategies and develop therapeutic drugs to combat the disease. There are  different strategies for developing small molecular anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs,  including targeting coronavirus structural proteins (e.g. spike protein),  non-structural proteins (nsp) (e.g. RdRp, M(pro), PL(pro), helicase, nsp14, and  nsp16), host proteases (e.g. TMPRSS2, cathepsin, and furin) and the pivotal  proteins mediating endocytosis (e.g. PIKfyve), as well as developing endosome  acidification agents and immune response modulators. Favipiravir and chloroquine  are the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that were identified earlier in this epidemic and  repurposed for COVID-19 clinical therapy based on these strategies. However,  their efficacies are controversial. Currently, three small molecular  anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and Paxlovid (PF-07321332 plus  ritonavir), have been granted emergency use authorization or approved for  COVID-19 therapy in many countries due to their significant curative effects in  phase III trials. Meanwhile, a large number of promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug  candidates have entered clinical evaluation. The development of these drugs  brings hope for us to finally conquer COVID-19. In this account, we conducted a  comprehensive review of the recent advances in small molecule anti-SARS-CoV-2  agents according to the target classification. Here we present all the approved  drugs and most of the important drug candidates for each target, and discuss the  challenges and perspectives for the future research and development of  anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of combination therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia remains unclear. We evaluated favipiravir, camostat, and ciclesonide combination  therapy in patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: In this open-label  phase 3 study, hospitalized adults who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and had  COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled prior to official vaccination drive in Japan.  Participants were randomly assigned to favipiravir monotherapy or  favipiravir + camostat + ciclesonide combination therapy. The primary outcome was  the length of hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection after study treatment.  The hospitalization period was calculated from the time of admission to the time  of patient discharge using the clinical management guide of COVID-19 for  front-line healthcare workers developed by the Japanese Ministry of Health,  Labour, and Welfare (Version 3). Cases were registered between November 11, 2020,  and May 31, 2021. Japan Registry of Clinical Trials registration: jRCTs031200196.  FINDINGS: Of 121 enrolled patients, 56 received monotherapy and 61 received  combination therapy. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the groups.  The median time of hospitalization was 10 days for the combination and 11 days  for the monotherapy group. The median time to discharge was statistically  significantly lower in the combination therapy vs monotherapy group (HR, 1·67  (95% CI 1·03-2·7; P = 0·035). The hospital discharge rate was statistically  significantly higher in the combination therapy vs monotherapy group in patients  with less severe COVID-19 infections and those who were ≤60 years. There were no  significant differences in clinical findings between the groups at 4, 8, 11, 15,  and 29 days. Adverse events were comparable between the groups. There were two  deaths, with one in each group. INTERPRETATION: Combination oral favipiravir,  camostat and, ciclesonide therapy could decrease the length of hospitalization  stays without safety concerns in patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia.  However, lack of hard clinical primary outcome is one of the major limitations of  the study.

AB  - The high incidences of COVID-19 cases are believed to be associated with high transmissibility rates, which emphasizes the need for the discovery of  evidence-based antiviral therapies for curing the disease. The rationale of  repurposing existing classes of antiviral small molecule therapeutics against  SARS-CoV-2 infection has been expected to accelerate the tedious and expensive  drug development process. While Remdesivir has been recently approved to be the  first treatment option for specific groups of COVID-19 patients, combinatory  therapy with potential antiviral drugs may be necessary to enhance the efficacy  in different populations. Hence, a comprehensive list of investigational  antimicrobial drug compounds such as Favipiravir, Fidaxomicin, Galidesivir,  GC376, Ribavirin, Rifabutin, and Umifenovir were computationally evaluated in  this study. We performed in silico docking and molecular dynamics simulation on  the selected small molecules against RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is one  of the key target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, using AutoDock and GROMACS.  Interestingly, our results revealed that the macrocyclic antibiotic, Fidaxomicin,  possesses the highest binding affinity with the lowest energy value of  -8.97 kcal/mol binding to the same active sites of RdRp. GC376, Rifabutin,  Umifenovir and Remdesivir were identified as the next best compounds. Therefore,  the above-mentioned compounds could be considered good leads for further  preclinical and clinical experimentations as potentially efficient antiviral  inhibitors for combination therapies against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The development of specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection is a major challenge facing global science and healthcare. Despite numerous attempts, there  are still no truly effective drugs. Currently, the main approach in the creation  of drugs against COVID-19 is repurposing, i.e., re-profiling existing drugs  approved for medical use, for example, the use of a drug for the treatment of  Ebola-Remdesivir, and the use of a drug for the treatment of  influenza-Favipiravir. However, it is already obvious that these drugs are not  specific enough nor effective enough. Another promising approach is the creation  of new molecules, but it should be noted immediately that implementation requires  much more time and costs. However, the search for new SARS-CoV-2 specific  antiviral agents continues. The aim of our work was the creation of new  5-substituted uridine derivatives as potential inhibitors of coronavirus  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The substances were obtained in high yields by the  Suzuki‒Miyaura reaction and characterized using modern physicochemical methods.  However, testing of their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 did not reveal a  significant inhibitory effect.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus led to a global pandemic.  HCQ and FPV were used early in the pandemic as a treatment modality for COVID-19.  Various studies evaluated the HCQ and FPV effectiveness, based on the mortality  endpoint and showed conflicting results. We hypothesize that analyzing the  difference in the LOS as a significant endpoint would be of a major interest,  especially for healthcare providers, to prevent a lengthy hospitalization and  disease progression. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study,  conducted via a medical chart review of COVD-19 patients who were admitted  between April 2020 and March 2021 with a moderate to severe illness. The LOS  endpoint was tested using the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank (WSR) model. Prior to  using the WSR model, the balance between the HCQ and FPV groups, the propensity  score matching, the LOS distribution, and the normality assumptions were tested.  Two sensitivity statistical analyses were conducted to confirm the results  (stratified log-rank test and U Welch test after transforming the LOS by the  squared root values). Results: A total of 200 patients were included for the  analysis: 83 patients in the HCQ group and 117 patients in the FPV group.  Thirty-seven patients were matched in each group. The LOS data was positively  skewed and violated the normality (Shapiro-Wilk p &lt; 0.001) and had an unequal  variance (Levene's test, p = 0.019). The WSR test showed no statistical  significance in the LOS endpoint, with a median of -0.75 days (95% confidence  interval: -4.0 to 2.5, p = 0.629), in favor of the HCQ group (four days), in  comparison to seven days of the FPV group. The WSR findings were further  confirmed with the stratified log rank test (p = 740) and the U Welch test (p =  391). Conclusions: The study concluded that the HCQ and FPV treatments have a  comparable effectiveness in terms of the LOS in the moderate to severe COVID-19  patients. This study highlights the importance of analyzing the LOS as a relevant  endpoint, in order to prevent the costs of a lengthy hospitalization and disease  progression. The current study also emphasizes the importance of applying the  appropriate statistical testing when dealing with two-sample paired data and  analyzing non-parametric data such as the LOS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Favipiravir, an antiviral agent with activity against SARS-CoV-2, was made available to hospitals in Japan for off-label use among COVID-19  patients between 2020 and 2021. METHODS: A nationwide observational cohort study  was conducted on patients who received favipiravir as part of clinical care  between February 2020 and December 2021. Information was collected on  demographics, comorbidities, severity of illness, use of favipiravir and other  medications targeting COVID-19, adverse events, clinical status at 7 and 14 days  and clinical outcome one month after admission to the hospital. RESULTS: A total  of 17,508 hospitalized patients who received favipiravir were registered from 884  hospitals. In terms of demographics, 55.9% were age ≥60 years, and 62.3% were  male. At least one of the four surveyed comorbidities was present in 45.5% of the  patients. The rates of clinical improvement at 7 and 14 days were 72.4％ and  87.5%, 61.4% and 76.6%, and 45.4% and 59.5% for mild, moderate, and severe  diseases, respectively. The case fatality rates within a month from  hospitalization were 3.3%, 12.6%, and 29.1% for mild, moderate, and severe  diseases, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between death and  advanced age, male sex, moderate or severe disease, diabetes, cardiovascular  diseases, and immunosuppression. Commonly reported adverse events included uric  acid level increase or hyperuricemia (16.8%), liver function abnormalities  (6.9%), and rash (1.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir was well tolerated among  COVID-19 patients. The study provides insights into the use of this agent at  hospitals across Japan in the early phase of the pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has been overwhelming the healthcare system worldwide. A rapidly growing number of younger pediatric patients in Thailand  necessitated the formulation of favipiravir, the most locally accessible  antiviral agent against COVID-19, into a child-friendly dosage form as a safer  alternative to a dispersion of crushed tablets in simple syrup. While striving to  quickly develop a liquid formulation that is feasible for any local hospital  production units, an oral solution was chosen due to its simplicity. Despite the  large dose and poor aqueous solubility of favipiravir, a combination of pH  control and use of poloxamer as a solubilizing agent has enabled us to streamline  the manufacturing process of a 200 mg/15 mL oral solution for hospital  compounding. To ensure its efficacy and safety, a specification for quality  control was also established in accordance with the ICH quality guidelines and  USP. The finished product stability was subsequently demonstrated under the  conditions of 5°C ± 3°C, 25°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5% RH, 30°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5% RH,  and 40°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5% RH. The results indicated that our formulation can be  stored at 30°C ± 2°C/75% RH for 30 days, which will very well serve the need to  allow drug distribution and patient use during the crisis, while the shelf-life  can be extended to 60 days when stored at 5°C ± 3°C. Thus, accessibility to an  essential medical treatment has been successfully enhanced for pediatric patients  in Thailand and neighboring countries during the COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel very contagious infection which was designated a pandemic in all countries of the world in April  2020. Its presentation varies from mild to severe infection, but the majority of  infected patients have mild manifestations. Many therapeutic choices have been  suggested to treat the infection, but none are fully effective. CASE SUMMARY:  Herein we present a 26-year-old woman with a twin pregnancy at 36 wk and one day  gestation with confirmed COVID-19 who responded dramatically to convalescent  plasma therapy (CPT) and Favipiravir. CONCLUSION: Although this case report shows  the efficacy of CPT in addition to usual medications used for COVID-19, there are  many questions that need to be answered regarding dosage, para-clinical efficacy,  side effects and combination therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the time course of computed tomography (CT) findings of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who required mechanical ventilation  and were treated with favipiravir and steroid therapy. RESULTS: Eleven patients  with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included. CT findings assessed at the three  time points showed that all patients had ground-glass opacities (GGO) and  consolidation and mixed pattern at intubation. Consolidation and mixed pattern  disappeared in most of the patients whereas GGO persisted in all patients at  1-month follow-up. In addition to GGO, a subpleural line and bronchus distortion  and bronchial dilatation were frequent findings. The degree of resolution of GGO  varied depending on each patient. The GGO score correlated significantly with the  time from symptoms onset to initiation of steroid therapy (ρ = 0.707, p = 0.015).  CONCLUSIONS: At 1-month follow-up after discharge, non-GGO lesions were absorbed  almost completely, and GGO were a predominant CT manifestation. Starting steroid  therapy earlier after onset of symptoms in severe COVID-19 pneumonia may reduce  the extent of GGO at 1-month follow-up.

AB  - The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rampaged the world with more than 236 million confirmed cases and over 4.8 million deaths across the  world reported by the world health organization (WHO) till Oct 5, 2021. Due to  the advent of different variants of coronavirus, there is an urgent need to  identify effective drugs and vaccines to combat rapidly spreading virus varieties  across the globe. Ferrocene derivatives have attained immense interest as  anticancer, antifungal, antibacterial, and antiparasitic drug candidates.  However, the ability of ferrocene as anti-COVID-19 is not yet explored.  Therefore, in the present work, we have synthesized four new ferrocene Schiff  bases (L1-L4) to understand the active sites and biological activity of ferrocene  derivatives by employing various molecular descriptors, frontier molecular  orbitals (FMO), electron affinity, ionization potential, and molecular  electrostatic potential (MEP). A theoretical insight on synthesized ferrocene  Schiff bases was accomplished by molecular docking, frontier molecular orbitals  energies, active sites, and molecular descriptors which were further compared  with drugs being currently used against COVID-19, i.e., dexamethasone,  hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir (FPV), and remdesivir (RDV). Moreover, through  the molecular docking approach, we recorded the inhibitions of ferrocene  derivatives on core protease (6LU7) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of  substituents on the anti-COVID activity of these synthesized compounds. The  computational outcome indicated that L1 has a powerful 6LU7 inhibition of  SARS-CoV-2 compared to the currently used drugs. These results could be helpful  to design new ferrocene compounds and explore their potential application in the  prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Favipiravir is one of the most used antiviral agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 infection in many countries, including Thailand. This  study aimed to investigate the effect of favipiravir-warfarin interaction in  terms of changes in international normalized ratio (INR) of patients. Medication  charts of all inpatients in a hospital in Thailand between April 2021 and March  2022 were reviewed. Patients who received either warfarin with standard care or  warfarin with favipiravir were included. The INR levels of patients were  monitored at baseline and the earliest date following treatment, as well as other  laboratory parameters. There were 43 and 53 patients in the warfarin-favipiravir  and the warfarin-only groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics, such as  sex, age, body mass index, and warfarin dose, were not significantly different  between the 2 groups. The results showed that the mean INR of patients using  favipiravir and warfarin was increased from 2.14 to 3.88 (P < .001), while the  patients using warfarin alone had no increase in the mean INR (1.93 vs 1.91; P =  .906). Other parameters were not significantly changed, including white blood  cell count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and liver function.  However, an increase in platelet count was observed in the favipiravir-warfarin  group, but not in the control group. This real-world study highlighted a  significant increase in the INR levels of patients who used favipiravir together  with warfarin, compared to patients who used only warfarin. However, the  interaction did not affect other laboratory parameters, except an increase in  platelet count.

AB  - Background Favipiravir was widely used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) early in the pandemic. Later, many reports began to be published about  the side effects of favipiravir on different tissues. However, the side effects  of favipiravir on the oral and nasal mucosa remain unknown. This experimental  study aimed to evaluate the pathological effects of favipiravir on the oral-nasal  mucosa and investigate whether vitamin C (Vit C) reduces these lesions in old and  young rats. Methodology A total of 100 rats were used for this study. The rats  were administered favipiravir (20 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) and Vit C (150 mg/kg/day)  for 14 days. At the end of the study, rats were euthanatized, and oral-nasal  mucosal histopathological changes were evaluated. Nuclear factor kappa-ligand  (RANKL) and caspase-3 expressions were immunohistochemically examined. Results  Favipiravir caused severe lesions in old rats compared to young, and the severity  of the lesions increased with the dosage. Severe hyperemia and erosive-ulcerative  lesions were observed in the oral-nasal mucosa. In addition, increased RANKL and  caspase-3 expressions were observed in a dose-dependent manner. In both young and  old groups, Vit C treatment showed decreased caspase-3 and RANKL expression; a  more prominent decrease was seen in young rats. Conclusions This study showed  that favipiravir could cause histopathological lesions in the oral and nasal  mucosa. However, the administration of Vit C with favipiravir can provide a  protective effect against this damage. The curative effect of Vit C was more  pronounced in young rats and at low doses.

AB  - Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in December 2019, more than 23 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. In  response to this pandemic, a global mobilization of scientific, industrial and  political support has ensued. However, more than 8 months later, as studies  multiply and several governments are embarking on a resumption of their  activities, the threat still remains. Our efforts to understand the evolution of  the virus and the means to defeat it, at the dawn of a possible new wave, have  raised more questions than provided clear and unequivocal answers. Compared to  diseases caused by previously known human coronavirus, COVID-19 shows higher  transmissibility, as a matter of fact "deeply concerning" cases continue to  increase. Under these circumstances, and based on the information we have  collected so far, this paper provides an overview of the epidemiological status  of COVID-19 by considering, first through comparisons with other coronaviruses,  similarities that may guide prevention measures and potentially effective  therapies. From this starting point, we aimed to discuss the evidence around the  efficacy of masks and respirators for different group of the population. Finally,  we address therapeutic aspects including perspectives of vaccines and some  antimicrobial agents such as remdesivir, favipiravir, chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin and immunomodulators.

The present review has focused on promising repurposing drugs,  including remdesivir, lopinvar/retinovar, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine,  monoclonal antibodies and vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides, our  review has also focused on many organizations that are in the race to develop  vaccines using various approaches including DNA, RNA, viral vectors and subunit  proteins against this highly contagious respiratory disease. The spike protein is  being studied by scientists all over the world to develop potential vaccines. The  antiviral drugs, antibodies and vaccines developed by various researchers around  the world have entered clinical trials in humans. The current clinical trials for  antiviral agents and vaccines with promising outcomes are being discussed. So  far, four vaccines developed by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Johnson and  Johnson vaccine and two AstraZeneca vaccines (produced by SKBio in the Republic  of Korea and Serum Institute of India) are approved by the World Health  Organization for public use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pediatric COVID-19 in Thailand, where favipiravir is the mainstay of antiviral treatment.  METHODS: We conducted a hospital based observational cohort study of COVID-19  among children. The study included children (age <15 years) with confirmed  positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 from  nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: From April to July 2021, 416 cases with a median  age of 7.1 (interquartile range 2.7-11.6) years were included in the study. The  spectrum of disease included 82 (20%) asymptomatic, 232 (56%) mild and 102 (24%)  with pneumonia. Abnormal chest x-ray findings included ground-glass opacities  (46%), focal infiltrations (27%), perihilar opacities (19%), reticular  infiltrations (15%) and other non-specific findings (4%). Only 12 children (3%)  required oxygen support. Favipiravir was prescribed to 129 children (31%); 102  patients with pneumonia and 27 patients at risk for disease progression.  Pneumonia was more common in age <3 years compared with those aged 3-<12 years  (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.17-0.52), 12-15 years (aOR 0.40, 95% CI  0.21-0.77) and in patients with comorbidities (aOR 2.36, 95% CI 1.09-5.12).  CONCLUSIONS: One-fourth of pediatric COVID-19 patients had pneumonia, but few  required oxygen support. Off-label use of Favipiravir in pediatric COVID-19  patients in a recent outbreak in Bangkok is reported.

AB  - The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has now become a pandemic with no approved therapeutic agent. At the moment, the  genomic structure, characteristics, and pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 have  been reported. Based upon this information, several drugs including the directly  acting antivirals have been proposed to treat people with coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19). This rapid review aims to describe the directly acting  antivirals that have been examined for use in the management of COVID-19.  Searches were conducted in three electronic databases, supplemented with a search  on arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChinaXiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Chinese Clinical  Trial Registry for studies examining the use of antivirals in COVID-19 to  identify for case reports, case series, observational studies, and randomized  controlled studies describing the use of antivirals in COVID-19. Data were  extracted independently and presented narratively. A total of 98 studies were  included, comprising of 38 published studies and 60 registered clinical trials.  These drugs include the broad spectrum antivirals such as umifenovir, protease  inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir as well as the RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase inhibitors, remdesivir, and favipiravir. Other drugs that have been  used include the nucleosidase inhibitors and polymerase acidic endonuclease  inhibitors which are currently approved for prevention of influenza infections.  While some of the drugs appear promising in small case series and reports, more  clinical trials currently in progress are required to provide higher quality  evidence.

AB  - COVID-19 patients in critical conditions are hospitalized and treated with various protocols including antiviral drugs, which have been updated repeatedly.  This study was aimed to analyze the demographics, costs, and outcomes of drug  regimens in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in "Ali Asghar" hospital, affiliated  with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, from March 2019 to December 2020 as a  retrospective study, approved by the ethics committee of Shiraz University of  Medical Sciences (IR.SUMS.REC.1399.1003) on Dec. 28, 2020. Using hospital  information system (HIS) data, 2174 patients receiving favipiravir, remdesivir,  interferon-β, and Kaletra(®) were analyzed. Descriptive, univariate, and  regression analyses were used. The costs and consequences of different drug  regimens were significantly different (P value < 0.05); the highest and lowest  costs belonged to remdesivir and Kaletra(®), respectively. The highest and lowest  mean length of stay and mortality were related to remdesivir and favipiravir,  respectively. Mortality did not differ significantly with various regimens.  Length of stay was significantly shorter with favipiravir and Kaletra(®) than  interferon-β. Remdesivir had significantly the highest cost. Age presented a  significantly positive relationship with mortality and length of stay. Besides,  ICU admission significantly increased mortality, length of stay, and costs.  Underlying diseases and low blood oxygen saturation contributed to mortality.  COVID-19 correlation with age and underlying diseases is accordant with the  published data. Given the highest costs and broad usage of remdesivir, besides  controversies regarding its outcomes and side effects, a stricter evaluation of  remdesivir benefits seems essential. Totally, COVID-19 therapeutic protocols  should be selected carefully to optimize costs and outcomes.

AB  - AIM: This study compared the clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia treated with high-dose  methylprednisolone and other steroids. METHODS: This retrospective observational  study included critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia adult patients with tracheal  intubation treated between April 1, 2020, and September 15, 2021. Of the 46  patients who met the inclusion criteria, 36 received steroid pulse therapy (Group  P) and 10 received steroids without pulse therapy (Group NP). Subgroup analyses  in Group P by methylprednisolone dose of 1000 or 500 mg for 3 days during  intensive care unit stay were carried out. The primary and secondary outcomes  were 28-day mortality and steroid-associated complications, respectively.  RESULTS: In the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis, there was no difference in the  28-day survival between P and NP groups (log-rank P = 0.046). Univariate Cox  proportional hazard model also showed that Group P had a decreased 28-day  mortality (hazard ratio 0.30; [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.44]; P < 0.01).  After adjusting for covariates (age, sex, remdesivir, baricitinib, and  favipiravir), using the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, Group P had  improved 28-day mortality (0.50 [0.30-0.85], P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Steroid pulse  therapy might improve the 28-day and in-hospital mortality in critically ill  patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Serious Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) has led to COVID 19 pandemic a year ago and it has not been globally taken under control  yet. COVID 19 tends to have poorer prognosis in cancer patients. Additionally, we  have no well-established guidelines for management of these patients during  pandemic, in terms of treatment of 'cancer' and treatment of 'COVID 19'. Tyrosine  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are given without any break in cancer patients to have  better survival outcomes in daily routine. However, there is no well-established  data to continue or delay ALK inhibitors in lung cancer patients infected with  SARS-CoV2. Concomittant use of ALK inhibitors and COVID 19 antiviral treatment is  a dilemma because of the lack of data in this area. CASE REPORT: A 47-year old  female metastatic ALK positive nonsquamous cell lung cancer patient on alectinib,  a second generation ALK inhibitor was diagnosed with symptomatic COVID 19. She  was given favipiravir for COVID 19 while continuing alectinib.Management and  outcome: The patient continued alectinib during COVID 19 antiviral treatment  without any break. She tolerated 'concomittant' alectinib & favipiravir. She had  partial remission after three months of alectinib without any dose adjustment  despite active COVID 19 medication. DISCUSSION: To best of our knowledge, this is  the first case who continued alectinib without dose adjustment during antiviral  COVID-19 medication without clinically worsening. There is limited data about  'concomittant' use of TKIs and antiviral COVID 19 medication in the literature.  There are some case reports, but they generally tended to delay or suspend TKIs  during COVID 19 antiviral medication. Our case differs from them in terms of  continuation of alectinib without any break or additional side effects during  favipiravir for symptomatic COVID 19. We consider that our case might contribute  to the literature in terms of management of cancer patients on targeted therapy  during COVID 19 antiviral treatment. However, clinical trials are needed in this  area.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is increasingly recognized as a serious, worldwide public health concern. Most of the patients  with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms. It is important to identify  the unusual manifestations and their long-term complication. CASE PRESENTATION: A  case of COVID-19 in 45 years old man with septic arthritis due to Staphylococcus  aureus is presented. COVID-19 was diagnosed using real-time polymerase chain  reaction without obvious clinical manifestation. The patient had no history of  trauma or inflammatory arthritis and had progressive left knee pain and  limitation of movement. Knee X-ray was normal. Aspiration of the knee joint fluid  showed a cloudy and purulent appearance. The patient was admitted to hospital and  immediately treated with vancomycin 1gr/12 hr. A polymerized chain reaction (PCR)  test for COVID-19 was performed, which was positive 24 h after hospitalization.  Staphylococcus aureus was reported in synovial fluid culture which was sensitive  to vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, thus vancomycin was continued. On the 4th day of  hospitalization the patient had cough, therefore underwent CT scan lungs and  ground-glass opacities (GGO) characteristic of COVID-19 were noticed. Favipiravir  and interferon were started. Patient's knee aspiration was performed for 5  consecutive days. On the 6th day of hospitalization, joint fluid markedly  decreased and the patient's oxygen saturation was 96%. One week after  hospitalization, the patient was discharged and a month later knee examination  was completely normal. CONCLUSIONS: Septic arthritis should be considered in the  manifestations or co-morbidity of COVID-19 patients with joint pain, swelling or  redness.

AB  - Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum oral antiviral agent that shows in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Presently, data on the real-world effectiveness and optimal  dosage of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 are limited. We conducted a  retrospective observational study of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 at  five tertiary care hospitals in Thailand. We reviewed patient charts to obtain  all necessary data. Among 247 COVID-19 patients, 63 (23.0%) received ≥1 dose of  favipiravir. Of these 63 patients, 61.9% were male with a median age of 48 years  (range 22-85 years), 27.0% required an O(2) nasal cannula, 9.5% required  non-invasive ventilation and/or high-flow O(2) therapy, and 6.4% required  invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO. The median baseline NEWS2 score was  5 (0-16). The Day-7 clinical improvement rate [95%CI] was 66.7% [53.7-78.0%] in  all patients, 92.5% [75.7-99.1%] in patients who did not require O(2)  supplementation, and 47.2% [0.4-64.5%] in patients who required O(2)  supplementation. No life-threatening adverse events were identified. The 28-day  mortality rate was 4.8%. A multivariate analysis revealed three poor prognostic  factors for Day-7 clinical improvement (odds ratio (95%CI); p-value): older age  (0.94 (0.89-0.99); p = 0.04), a higher baseline NEWS2 score (0.64 (0.47-0.88); p  = 0.006), and a lower favipiravir loading dose (≤45 mg/kg/day) (0.04 (0.005-0.4);  p = 0.006). In conclusion, our study reports the promising effectiveness of  favipiravir for treating COVID-19 patients. In addition to older age and a high  baseline NEWS2 score, a low loading dose of favipiravir (≤45 mg/kg/day) was also  identified as a poor prognostic factor for early clinical improvement. Further  studies to explore the optimal dose and the optimal timing of drug initiation for  favipiravir should be performed.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide at an exponential rate affecting millions of people instantaneously. Currently, various drugs are under investigation to  treat an enormously increasing number of COVID-19 patients. This dreadful  situation clearly demands an efficient strategy to quickly identify drugs for the  successful treatment of COVID-19. Hence, drug repurposing is an effective  approach for the rapid discovery of frontline arsenals to fight against COVID-19.  Successful application of this approach has resulted in the repurposing of some  clinically approved drugs as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates. Several of  these drugs are either antimalarials, antivirals, antibiotics or corticosteroids  and they have been repurposed based on their potential to negate virus or reduce  lung inflammation. Large numbers of clinical trials have been registered to  evaluate the effectiveness and clinical safety of these drugs. Till date, a few  clinical studies are complete and the results are primary. WHO also conducted an  international, multi-country, open-label, randomized trials-a solidarity trial  for four antiviral drugs. However, solidarity trials have few limitations like no  placebos were used, additionally any drug may show effectiveness for a particular  population in a region which may get neglected in solidarity trial analysis. The  ongoing randomized clinical trials can provide reliable long-term follow-up  results that will establish both clinical safety and clinical efficacy of these  drugs with respect to different regions, populations and may aid up to worldwide  COVID-19 treatment research. This review presents a comprehensive update on  majorly repurposed drugs namely chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir,  lopinavir-ritonavir, favipiravir, ribavirin, azithromycin, umifenovir,  oseltamivir as well as convalescent plasma therapy used against SARS-CoV-2. The  review also summarizes the data recorded on the mechanism of anti-SARS-CoV-2  activity of these repurposed drugs along with the preclinical and clinical  findings, therapeutic regimens, pharmacokinetics, and drug-drug interactions.

T2  - International journal of health sciences
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The time for PCR positivity to negativity is defined as nucleic acid conversion time (NCT) and is very important in terminating the isolation of  patients and determining infectiousness in patients with COVID-19. The aim of  this study is to determine the median NCT and to evaluate the clinical and  laboratory parameters affecting it in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This study  included 318 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 diagnosed with PCR  positivity retrospectively. RESULTS: The median NCT was 11 days. Patients were  divided into 2 groups as early (<11 days) and late conversion (≥11 days). Older  age, sore throat, onset fever, fever 72 h after hospitalization, history of  exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus without a mask, and moderated disease were  significantly more common in the late conversion group. In addition, favipiravir  use was higher in early conversion group and hydroxychloroquine use was higher in  late conversion group. In multivariate analysis, sore throat (OR = 2.570; 95% CI:  1.051-6.284, P = 0.039) and hydroxychloroquine use (OR = 3.518, 95% CI:  1.163-10.635, P = 0,026) were independent risk factors for late conversion.  Favipiravir use (OR = 0.062, 95% CI: 0.021-0.184, P = 0.0001) negatively affected  the late conversion. CONCLUSION: NCT was longer in patients with COVID-19 who had  sore throat at admission and were treated with hydroxychloroquine instead of  favipiravir.

AB  - Two thiazole-based complexes were prepared from Co(II) and Cu(II) ions. The new ligand and its complexes were fully characterized by analytical and spectral  techniques. The ligand behaved as a neutral tridentate in its keto-form towards  the metals via O(8), O(10) and O(18) atoms. This was suggested based on the lower  shift of υ(CH[bond, double bond]O), υ(C[bond, double bond]O)(amide) and υ(C-O)  vibrations. The electronic transitions in Co(II)-HL and Cu(II)-HL complexes  displayed d-d- transitions which belong to (4)T(1g)→(4)A(2g)(F) &  (4)T(1g)(F)→(4)T(1g) (P) and (2)Eg →(2)T(2)g, in the two complexes, respectively.  ESR spectrum of Cu(II)-HL complex displayed g-factor by the following order;  g(//)(2.1740)>g(⊥)(2.0935)>2.0023, which agrees with octahedral geometry. The  geometry optimization was executed by DFT/B3LYP method under valence double zeta  polarized basis set (6-31G*), to confirm the structural forms and the mode of  bonding. The orientation and the charges of O(8), O(10) and O(18) atoms, support  the coordination of the ligand in its keto-form with the metal ions.  Pharmacophore profiles were obtained regarding thiazole ligand and other  recommended drugs (arbidol, avigan and idoxuridine) that used in treatment  protocol of COVID-19 pandemic. Also, query was run in MolPort-library to obtain  antiviral analogues, to broaden the search for an effective treatment. Three  analogues were obtained for arbidol, avigan and idoxuridine drugs, which have the  following numbers; MolPort-047-605-644, MolPort-004-768-508 and  MolPort-028-750-709, respectively. Moreover, molecular docking was carried out to  obtain all interaction details and rank the efficiency of thiazole compound  versus the three antivirals in their interaction with the two COVID-19 proteins.  The outcomes suggested the significant antiviral activity of idoxuridine and  thiazole (enol-form), which not reach to eliminate the pandemic exactly. While,  arbidol and avigan did not have an effective antiviral role, although they still  used in COVID-19 treatment protocol.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on December 2019 about a coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province (China). Subsequently, on  March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an  enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in  birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as  COVID-19. More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus  treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19. Hence,  we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database. The  eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov  base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for  the study; describe the participants' clinical conditions; and utilize  interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in  patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). It is  essential to emphasize that this article only captured trials listed in the  clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more  than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir,  oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines  (TCM). Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical  trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery  of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach  the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation  and distribution.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health crisis. There is currently a great need for effective and safe therapies directed at the disease, but no  drugs are presently registered for use in COVID-19. Several directed therapies  have been proposed, and most are still in clinical trials. Currently available  published, peer-reviewed results mostly involve small sample sizes with study  limitations restricting the interpretation of the findings. Many trials currently  published also do not have a control group, limiting the interpretation of the  effect of the intervention. Investigational directed therapies as well as  investigational supportive therapies against COVID-19 are reviewed here.  Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine show promise as directed therapies, but  current trial results are conflicting. Lopinavir/ritonavir also shows potential,  but was started late in the disease course in most trials. No randomised  controlled evidence is currently available for remdesivir and favipiravir.  Corticosteroid use is not recommended for directed therapy against COVID-19, and  the role of tocilizumab is currently unclear, based on limited evidence. Early  initiation of investigational directed therapies may provide benefit in selected  patients. The results from larger randomised controlled trials will clarify the  place of these therapies in COVID-19 treatment.

T2  - The Journal of clinical and aesthetic dermatology
AB  - Favipiravir, an antiviral agent originally used for influenza infections, has become popular due to its beneficial signals in coronavirus disease. It is  currently used in some countries within COVID-19 treatment protocols. This is an  initial report of favipiravir-related fluorescence observed in three healthcare  providers working in the same ward in our hospital. All three individuals had  been diagnosed with COVID-19 two months earlier and were treated with  favipiravir. None of the three individuals received hydroxychloroquine or  tetracyclines. Wood's light examination led to an incidental discovery of  favipiravir-induced fluorescence involving the sclera, nails, and teeth. In all  patients, white linear, square, and band-like specks of fluorescence were noticed  on the sclera of both eyes, some teeth, and the proximal part of all fingernails  and toenails. Exposure of the eyes to the Wood's light was for a brief duration  of 3 to 5 seconds during examination and photodocumentation. Favipiravir might  cause bright white fluorescence of nails, sclera, and teeth, detectable by Wood's  light even two months after its cessation.

AB  - Scientific research continues on new preventive and therapeutic strategies against severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). So far,  there is no proven curative treatment, and a valid alternative therapeutic  approach needs to be developed. This study is designed to evaluate the effect of  quercetin in COVID-19 treatment. This was a single-centre, prospective randomized  controlled cohort study. Routine care versus QCB (quercetin, vitamin C,  bromelain) supplementation was compared between 429 patients with at least one  chronic disease and moderate-to-severe respiratory symptoms. Demographic  features, signs, laboratory results and drug administration data of patients were  recorded. The endpoint was that QCB supplementation was continued throughout the  follow-up period from study baseline to discharge, intubation, or death. The most  common complaints at the time of hospital admission were fatigue (62.4%), cough  (61.1%), anorexia (57%), thirst (53.7%), respiratory distress (51%) and chills  (48.3%). The decrease in CRP and ferritin levels was higher in the QCB group (all  Ps were < 0.05). In the QCB group, the increase in platelet and lymphocyte counts  was higher (all Ps were < 0.05). QCB did not reduce the risk of events during  follow-up. Adjustments for statistically significant parameters, including the  lung stage, use of favipiravir and presence of comorbidity did not change the  results. While there was no difference between the groups in terms of event  frequency, the QCB group had more advanced pulmonary findings. QCB supplement is  shown to have a positive effect on laboratory recovery. While there was no  difference between the groups in terms of event frequency, QCB supplement group  had more advanced pulmonar findings, and QCB supplement is shown to have a  positive effect on laboratory recovery/results. Therefore, we conclude that  further studies involving different doses and plasma level measurements are  required to reveal the dose/response relationship and bioavailability of QCB for  a better understanding of the role of QCB in the treatment of SARS CoV-2.

T2  - Metabolism open
AB  - The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 which causes the COVID-19 disease is a global public health emergency. Coronavirus are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses and  their genome size is approximately 30 kb, which encodes some important structural  proteins. The interaction between viral Spike protein and ACE2 on the host cell  surface is of significant interest since it initiates the infection process. This  review will focus on the effectiveness of reuse of currently used drugs against  COVID-19, including clinical trials, molecular docking, and computational  modelling approach. METHODS: A systematic search in Pubmed, MEDLINE, EMBASE was  conducted from from January 2020 to July 2021.Applying computational, clinical  and experimental approaches, numerous drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir,  ribavirin, lopinavir, ritonavir, tocilizumab have been repurposed and have shown  promising protection against SARS-CoV2 both in vitro and in clinical conditions.  Although there is only one repurposed drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), i.e,  Remdesivir. However, the FDA withdrew the authorization of the drugs  Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine,that are not effective for COVID-19 and can  also cause serious heart problems. Molecular coupling would be the ideal  technique to identify such therapeutic agents against COVID19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide since early 2020, and there are still no signs of resolution. The Japanese Clinical  Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock (J-SSCG) 2020  Special Committee created the Japanese rapid/living recommendations on drug  management for COVID-19 using the experience of creating the J-SSCG. METHODS: The  Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)  approach was used to determine the certainty of the evidence and strength of the  recommendations. The first edition of this guideline was released on September 9,  2020, and this document is the revised edition (version 4.0; released on  September 9, 2021). Clinical questions (CQs) were set for the following seven  drugs: favipiravir (CQ1), remdesivir (CQ2), corticosteroids (CQ4), tocilizumab  (CQ5), anticoagulants (CQ7), baricitinib (CQ8), and casirivimab/imdevimab (CQ9).  Two CQs (hydroxychloroquine [CQ3] and ciclesonide [CQ6]) were retrieved in this  updated version. RECOMMENDATIONS: Favipiravir is not suggested for all patients  with COVID-19 (GRADE 2C). Remdesivir is suggested for patients with moderate  COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2B).  Corticosteroids are recommended for patients with moderate COVID-19 requiring  supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 1B) and for patients with severe  COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation/intensive care (GRADE 1A); however,  their administration is not recommended for patients with mild COVID-19 not  requiring supplemental oxygen (GRADE 1B). Tocilizumab is suggested for patients  with moderate COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2B).  Anticoagulant administration is recommended for patients with moderate COVID-19  requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization and patients with severe COVID-19  requiring mechanical ventilation/intensive care (good practice statement).  Baricitinib is suggested for patients with moderate COVID-19 requiring  supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2C). Casirivimab/imdevimab is  recommended for patients with mild COVID-19 not requiring supplemental oxygen  (GRADE 1B). We hope that these updated clinical practice guidelines will help  medical professionals involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic, most countries started treating their patients with  various therapies. However, the data regarding their safety and effectiveness is  still lacking. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the adverse drug reactions (ADRs)  incidence and their predisposing factors among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A  retrospective observational study that was conducted at a tertiary academic  hospital from March - June 2020. Patients were included if they were ≥ 18 years  old, inpatient, had a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  positive for COVID-19, and were treated with; (lopinavir-ritonavir,  hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, favipiravir, ribavirin, or interferon-ß) either  as monotherapy or combination therapy for three days or longer. The data of  eligible patients were retrieved from the electronic medical records. A  standardized data collection form was designed to collect patient demographics,  COVID-19 severity based on the Saudi Ministry of Health management protocols,  antiviral therapies, duration of therapy, and length of stay (LOS). The ADRs were  identified via conducting a comprehensive review using predefined triggers and  were evaluated using Naranjo Score. RESULTS: A total of 155 patients were  included of which 123 (79.4%) were males. In our sample, the incidence proportion  of ADRs per patient was 72.3%. A total of 287 ADRs were identified most of them  were hepatic (n = 101, 35.2%), gastrointestinal (n = 59, 20.6%), hematological  (n = 47, 16%), and endocrine (n = 45, 15%). Hydroxychloroquine was the most  common drug associated with ADRs (n = 155). The length of stay (10 - 20 days) was  the only statistically significant with the ADR incidence (p-value = 0.008;  95 %CI 1.216:3.568). CONCLUSIONS: The ADRs are prevalent among COVID-19 patients,  which assure the importance of implementing active hospital-based  pharmacovigilance systems.

AB  - A hospitel is a hotel that has been designated as an extension of the healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic in resource-limited settings. However,  the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 admitted to this  unique type of facility have never been studied. We retrospectively reviewed the  medical records of adult patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to a single  hospitel in Bangkok, Thailand. Risk factors with respect to chest X-ray  progression and clinical progression were analyzed using a logistic regression. A  total of 514 patients were recruited, with a mean (standard deviation) age of  35.6 (13.4) years, and 58.6% were women. Patients were admitted after a median  (interquartile range) of 3 (2-6) days of illness and were classified with mild  (12.3%), moderate (86.6%), and severe (1.1%) conditions. Favipiravir and  corticosteroids were prescribed in 26.3% and 14.9% of patients, respectively.  Chest X-ray progression was found in 7.6% of patients, and hospital transfer  occurred in 2.9%, with no deaths. Favipiravir use (odds ratio (OR) 3.3, 95%  confidence interval (CI) 1.4-7.5, p = 0.005), nausea/vomiting after admission (OR  32.3, 95% CI 1.5-700.8, p = 0.03), and higher oxygen saturation on admission (OR  1.99; 95% CI 1.22-3.23, p = 0.005) were factors associated with chest X-ray  progression. Additionally, an oxygen requirement on admission was an independent  risk factor for hospital transfer (OR 904, 95% CI 113-7242, p &lt; 0.001). In a  setting where the hospitel has been proposed as an extension facility for  patients with relatively non-severe COVID-19, most patients could achieve a  favorable clinical outcome. However, patients who require oxygen supplementation  should be closely monitored for disease progression and promptly transferred to a  hospital if necessary.

AB  - Although a variety of existing drugs are being tested for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no efficacious treatment has been found so  far, particularly for severe cases. We report successful recovery in an elderly  patient with severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal  membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Despite administration of multiple antiviral drugs,  including lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, and favipiravir, the patient's  condition did not improve. However, after administration of another antiviral  drug, remdesivir, we were able to terminate invasive interventions, including  ECMO, and subsequently obtained negative polymerase chain reaction results.  Although further validation is needed, remdesivir might be effective in treating  COVID-19.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader, which removes nucleotide inhibitors such as Remdesivir that are incorporated into the viral RNA during  replication, reducing the efficacy of these drugs for treating COVID-19.  Combinations of inhibitors of both the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the  exonuclease could overcome this deficiency. Here we report the identification of  hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitors Pibrentasvir and Ombitasvir as SARS-CoV-2  exonuclease inhibitors. In the presence of Pibrentasvir, RNAs terminated with the  active forms of the prodrugs Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir  and AT-527 were largely protected from excision by the exonuclease, while in the  absence of Pibrentasvir, there was rapid excision. Due to its unique structure,  Tenofovir-terminated RNA was highly resistant to exonuclease excision even in the  absence of Pibrentasvir. Viral cell culture studies also demonstrate significant  synergy using this combination strategy. This study supports the use of  combination drugs that inhibit both the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and exonuclease for  effective COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic virus has been spreading throughout the world. Until now, no certified drugs have been discovered to efficiently  inhibit the virus. The scientists are struggling to find new safe bioactive  inhibitors of this deadly virus. In this study, we aim to find antagonists that  may inhibit the activity of the three major viral targets: SARS-CoV-2  3-chymotrypsin-like protease (6LU7), SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (6VYB), and a host  target human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (1R42), which is the  entry point for the viral encounter, were studied with the prospects of  identifying significant drug candidate(s) against COVID-19 infection. Then, the  protein stability produced score of less than 0.6 for all residues of all studied  receptors. This confirmed that these receptors are extremely stable proteins, so  it is very difficult to unstable the stability of these proteins through  utilizing individual drugs. Hence, we studied the combination and tricombination  therapy between bioactive compounds which have the best binding affinity and some  antiviral drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, simeprevir,  baloxavir, lopinavir, and favipiravir to show the effect of combination and  tricombination therapy to disrupt the stability of the three major viral targets  that are mentioned previously. Also, ADMET study suggested that most of all  studied bioactive compounds are safe and nontoxic compounds. All results  confirmed that caulerpin can be utilized as a combination and tricombination  therapy along with the studied antiviral drugs for disrupting the stability of  the three major viral receptors (6LU7, 6VYB, and 1R42).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare intensive care unit (ICU) and overall hospital mortality in patients treated with favipiravir and  lopinavir-ritonavir for COVID-19. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively  between March 10 and May 10, 2020, from patients' records admitted to ICU due to  COVID-19. Laboratory data, clinical characteristics, ICU and hospital mortality,  ICU and hospital length of stay were compared in patients treated with  favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients' data were  investigated. Favipiravir was used as the treatment for 85% of patients, with the  rest treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. Clinical and laboratory data of both  antiviral treatment groups were similar. Length of hospital stay was 16 (9-24)  days with favipiravir and 8.5 (5-12.5) days with lopinavir-ritonavir (p=0.002).  Length of ICU stay for favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir groups were 8 (5-15)  days and 4 (3-9) days, respectively (p=0.011). ICU mortality was 65.9% for the  favipiravir and 80% for lopinavir-ritonavir (p=0.002). Hospital mortality for  favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir was 67.1% and 80%, respectively (p=0.001).  CONCLUSION: The mortality in patients treated with favipiravir was less than  patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. Favipiravir needs more attention and  trials for its effect to be confirmed.

AB  - In this manuscript, we discuss the expectations versus the real-world results of four repurposed COVID-19 drugs: tocilizumab, remdesivir, favipiravir, and  dexamethasone from a clinical and pharmacovigilant point of view. We suggest that  though the results of two-phase III double-blind clinical trials have been less  than expected, tocilizumab has a real remaining potential to treat selected  critical cases of COVID-19 beyond clinical trials until more data are revealed.  On the contrary, remdesivir, though its FDA approval, and favipiravir are least  likely to benefit COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we recommend that the RECOVERY  dexamethasone should only be considered for critical hospitalized COVID-19  patients and we urge physicians in developing countries to avoid using it in  mild-moderate COVID-19 cases. Finally, we recommend considering a personalized  risk-benefit ratio before a decision is made using any of these drugs.

AB  - Once the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be pandemic, massive efforts have been launched by researchers around the globe to  combat this emerging infectious disease. Here we review the most recent data on  the novel SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. We analyzed its etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis,  prevention, and current medications. After that, we summarized the promising drug  delivery application of nanomaterial-based systems. Their preparation routes,  unique advantages over the traditional drug delivery routes and their toxicity  though risk analysis were also covered. We also discussed in detail the mechanism  of action for one example of drug-loaded nanomaterial drug delivery systems  (Avigan-contained nano-emulsions). This review provides insights about employing  nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems for the treatment of COVID-19 to  increase the bioavailability of current drugs, reducing their toxicity, and to  increase their efficiency.

AB  - In this article, we have reviewed the prevalence, diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment of COVID-19 in children. The incidence of COVID-19 among children under  18 years was 2.1% based on the reported studies, where the mortality rate in the  same age group was 0.2%. No death has been reported in children under 9-years  old. There are some articles that report children with COVID-19 having symptoms  similar to Kawasaki's disease. In these cases, heart complications were observed.  The best markers for diagnosing the severity of the disease in children are the  levels of bilirubin and hepatic enzymes. Large number of angiotensin converting  enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on cell surfaces, effective innate immune system, and  high level of blood lymphocyte have been reported to be the potent reasons for  lower incidence of severe symptoms of COVID-19 among children. Children can very  well be the carriers of this virus. Children with severe COVID-19 clinical  symptoms, especially those suffering from pneumonia, must be hospitalized similar  to adults, while quarantine is required for those having mild symptoms. Antiviral  medication (lopinavir, darunavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, ribavirin,  oseltamivir, tocilizumab, and umifenovir), ACE inhibitors, interferon-α2b,  co-therapy with azithromycin, inhaling iNO, and oxygen therapy can be used for  treatment. For the treatment of children without any clinical and infection  symptoms, home isolation protocol has been recommended.

AB  - Introduction: Favipiravir and Vitamin C (Vit C) were used together in the treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effects of favipiravir on the  periodontium are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to  investigate the effects of Favipiravir and Vit C treatment on alveolar bone  metabolism. Experimental: Fifty healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (2-3  months old) were randomly divided into five equal groups (n = 10): Control, Favi  20, Favi 100, Favi 20+Vit C, Favi 100+Vit C. Favipiravir (20 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg,  i.m.) and Vit C (150 mg/kg/day, oral) were administered to the rats for 14 days.  Alveolar bone loss (ABL) and histopathological changes were examined using a  light microscope. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine levels of receptor  activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), caspase-3, bone morphogenic  protein 2 (BMP-2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the bone tissues. Results:  Favipiravir increased the levels of RANKL and caspase-3 expression but decreased  BMP-2 and ALP levels in a dose-dependent manner. Favi 20+Vit C and Favi 100 +Vit  C groups showed decreased RANKL and caspase-3 levels in addition to increased  BMP-2 and ALP levels. Conclusion: Favipiravir can cause histopathological damage  to the periodontium, but administration of favipiravir combined with Vit C can  provide a protective effect against this damage.

T2  - International journal of biochemistry and molecular biology
AB  - COVID-19 is an important global public health problem that causes millions of infections worldwide. The specific antiviral drug for this new infection is still  under research. Some new antiviral drugs, including molnupiravir and favipiravir,  are proposed for usefulness in management of COVID-19. Additionally, some classic  antiviral drugs used for other viral infections are also reproposed for the  potentials for management of COVID-19. In the management of COVID-19, there are  several pharmacological actions. An important consideration in antiviral therapy  is the management of oxidative stress, which plays important roles in viral  infections including to COVID-19. The analysis of antioxidative properties of  alternative drugs for management of COVID-19 is interesting and can give basic  data for further new antiviral drug researching. Here, the authors perform a  molecular analysis on molnupiravir, favipiravir and other antiviral drugs with  proposed potentials for management of COVID-19 to determine their antioxidative  properties. Data from electron acceptor and donor calculation for each drug is  used for further estimating overall antioxidative characteristic. Based on the  present study, all studied drugs have overall antioxidative properties. Hence,  the advantage of molnupiravir, favipiravir and other antiviral drugs with  proposed potentials for the management of COVID-19 is their direct action on  viral molecule via binding-blocking process as well as antixodiative process. For  management of COVID-19 antioxidative stress, other non-antiviral drugs that are  proposed for clinical advantage might also be useful.

AB  - (1) Background: The WHO identified COVID-19 as a fast-growing epidemic worldwide. A few antivirals have shown promising effectiveness in treating COVID-19. This  study aimed to assess the correlation between antiviral drugs and the time until  viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2. (2) Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study  that included 1731 non-severe COVID-19 patients treated in NMC Royal Hospital,  UAE. (3) Results: A total of 1446 patients received symptomatic treatment only  (mean age of 35.6 ± 9.0 years). The analyzed antiviral treatment protocols were  azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir. The  produced Kaplan-Meier plots showed no significant differences in the time until  viral clearance among the compared protocols, which showed overlapping confidence  intervals, which were determined by performing the log-rank and adjusted pairwise  log-rank tests (p = 0.2, log-rank = 9.3). The age and gender of patients did not  significantly affect the rate of viral clearance regardless of the antiviral  therapy administered, even when compared to patients who received symptomatic  treatment only, with the exception of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, and  favipiravir, which increased the odds of a faster rate of viral clearance by 46%  after adjustments. (4) Conclusions: No significant differences were observed  regarding the time until viral clearance among non-severe COVID-19 patients  following the prescription of different antiviral drugs.

AB  - Specific language impairment (SLI) is one of the most common diseases in children, and early diagnosis can help to obtain better timely therapy  economically. It is difficult and time-consuming for clinicians to accurately  detect SLI through standard clinical assessments. Hence, machine learning  algorithms have been developed to assist in the accurate diagnosis of SLI. This  work aims to investigate the graph of the favipiravir molecule-based feature  extraction function and propose an accurate SLI detection model using vowels. We  proposed a novel handcrafted machine learning framework. This architecture  comprises the favipiravir molecular structure pattern, statistical feature  extractor, wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), iterative neighborhood component  analysis (INCA), and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Two feature  extraction models, statistical and textural, are employed in the handcrafted  feature generation methodology. A new nature-inspired graph-based feature  extractor that uses the chemical depiction of the favipiravir (favipiravir became  popular with the COVID-19 pandemic) is employed for feature extraction. Finally,  the proposed favipiravir pattern, statistical feature extractor, and wavelet  packet decomposition are used to create a feature vector. Moreover, a statistical  feature extractor is used in this work. The WPD generates multilevel features,  and the most meaningful features are selected using the NCA feature selector.  Finally, these chosen features are fed to SVM classifier for automated  classification. Two validation methods, (i) leave one subject out (LOSO) and (ii)  tenfold cross-validations (CV), are used to obtain robust classification results.  Our proposed favipiravir pattern-based model developed using a vowel dataset can  detect SLI children with an accuracy of 99.87% and 98.86% using tenfold and LOSO  CV strategies, respectively. These results demonstrated the high vowel  classification ability of the proposed favipiravir pattern-based model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease due to SARS-COV-2. Patients with risk factors are vulnerable to severe morbidity and  mortality. Favipiravir (FPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are considered possible  COVID-19 treatments. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of  FPV compared to HCQ in patients with COVID-19 as the standard of care approved by  the national protocol there. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study on  patients with COVID-19 who were administered either FPV or HCQ at King Faisal  Medical Complex, Taif, Saudi Arabia, from June 2020 to August 2020. RESULTS: In  total, 508 patients were included in the analysis. Patients were categorized into  three groups by medication. Patients enrolled in this study were 244 (55.8%) on  FPV, 193 (44.2%) on HCQ and 71 (13.81%) on neither medication. Patients who  received FPV had higher age and greater comorbidity. Most of the patients were  discharged on day 14 (n = 303, 59.6%), 26 (36.6%) in neither med, 154 (63.1%) in  FPV and 123 (63.7%) in HCQ groups with significant difference between groups (P <  0.0001). Mortality rate was 8.2% (n = 20) in FPV and 7.3% (n = 14) in HCQ groups  with significant difference between groups (P = 0.048). Regarding drug safety,  19.7% of patients treated with FPV vs 7.8% HCQ have adverse effects with  significant difference between groups (P < 0.0001). Most of the side effects were  increase ALT and AST. Meanwhile, prolonged Q-T interval was reported only in the  HCQ group (2.6%). From Cox regression modeling, only mechanical ventilation due  to Covid 19 was predictive for mortality (HR: 16.598, 95% CI: 7.095-38.828, P <  0.0001). Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in the prediction of  discharge of FPV (vs HCQ) (HR: 0.933, 95% CI: 0.729-1.195, P = 0.5843),  predictors of mortality were HCQ (vs FPV) (HR: 2.3, 95% CI: 0.994-5.487, P =  0.0518). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed improved survival time and  discharged time among patients in the HCQ versus FPV group with an insignificant  difference between them (P = 0.85, P = 0.06, respectively). CONCLUSION: The  present study concluded that FPV and HCQ showed comparable efficacy in decrease  mortality and oxygen requirements. FPV likely has a more favorable safety profile  regarding cardiac toxicity. A randomized clinical trial with large patient  numbers is recommended to confirm the effectiveness of these drugs in COVID-19  patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to understand the observational relationship between adoption of favipiravir into the national COVID-19 treatment  protocol and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates in Istanbul due to  COVID-19. METHODS: Data were harvested from the "Public Health Management  System-HSYS," which collate centrally the records of all known cases of COVID-19.  The total number of cases, numbers admitted to ICU, and number undergoing  intubation were compared between 2 time periods: 11(th) of March, the date on  which the first case in Turkey was confirmed, to 30(th) of March; and March 30,  to 10(th) of April, 5 days after Favipiravir was introduced into the treatment  algorithm when, the records were examined. RESULTS: The percentage of patients  requiring ICU admission diminished from 24% to 12%, whilst the percentage  intubated fell from 77% to 66%. These differences were both statistically  significant. CONCLUSION: The addition of favipiravir to the national COVID-19  treatment protocol may explain this rapid decrease in the rate of ICU admissions  and intubation.

AB  - Here, drug repurposing and molecular docking were employed to screen approved MPP inhibitors and their derivatives to suggest a specific therapeutic agent for the  treatment of COVID-19. The approved MPP inhibitors against HIV and HCV were  prioritized, while RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor remdesivir  including Favipiravir, alpha-ketoamide were studied as control groups. The target  drug surface hotspot was also investigated through the molecular docking  technique. Molecular dynamics was performed to determine the binding stability of  docked complexes. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion analysis  was conducted to understand the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness of the  screened MPP inhibitors. The results of the study revealed that Paritaprevir  (-10.9 kcal/mol) and its analog (CID 131982844) (-16.3 kcal/mol) showed better  binding affinity than the approved MPP inhibitors compared in this study,  including remdesivir, Favipiravir, and alpha-ketoamide. A comparative study among  the screened putative MPP inhibitors revealed that the amino acids T25, T26, H41,  M49, L141, N142, G143, C145, H164, M165, E166, D187, R188, and Q189 are at  potentially critical positions for being surface hotspots in the MPP of  SARS-CoV-2. The top 5 predicted drugs (Paritaprevir, Glecaprevir, Nelfinavir, and  Lopinavir) and the topmost analog showed conformational stability in the active  site of the SARS-CoV-2 MP protein. The study also suggested that Paritaprevir and  its analog (CID 131982844) might be effective against SARS-CoV-2. The current  findings are limited to in silico analysis and lack in vivo efficacy testing;  thus, we strongly recommend a quick assessment of Paritaprevir and its analog  (CID 131982844) in a clinical trial.

AB  - The Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept the world and caused a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 seems to have originated from bats as their reservoir  hosts over time. Similar to SARS-CoV, this new virus also exerts its action on  the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This action causes infections in cells  and establishes an infectious disease, COVID-19. Against this viral invasion, the  human body starts to activate the innate immune system in producing and releasing  proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α, and other chemokines,  such as G-CSF, IP10 and MCPl, which all develop and increase the inflammatory  response. In cases of COVID-19, excessive inflammatory responses occur, and  exaggerated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are detected in the serum,  resulting in cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm. This causes coagulation  abnormalities, excessive oxidation developments, mitochondrial permeability  transition, vital organ damage, immune system failure and eventually progresses  to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure.  Additionally, the excessive inflammatory responses also cause mitochondrial  dysfunction due to progressive and persistent stress. This damages cells and  mitochondria, leaving products containing mitochondrial DNA and cell debris  involved in the excessive chronic inflammation as damage-associated molecular  patterns. Thus, the respiratory infection progressively leads to disseminated  intravascular coagulation from acute respiratory distress syndrome, including  vascular endothelial cell damage and coagulation-fibrinolysis system disorders.  This condition causes central nervous system disorders, renal failure, liver  failure and, finally, multiple organ failure. Regarding treatment for COVID-19,  the following are progressive and multiple steps for mitigating the excessive  inflammatory response and subsequent cytokine storm in patients. First,  administering of favipiravir to suppress SARS-CoV-2 and nafamostat to inhibit  ACE2 function should be considered. Second, anti-rheumatic drugs (monoclonal  antibodies), which act on the leading cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6) and/or cytokine  receptors such as tocilizumab, should be administered as well. Finally, melatonin  may also have supportive effects for cytokine release syndrome, resulting in  mitochondrial function improvement. This paper will further explore these  subjects with reports mostly from China and Europe.

AB  - The uncertainty related to prevention and treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019 due to lack of effective vaccine candidates or drug molecules has resulted in  extensive spread of infection and mortality worldwide. Although the asymptomatic  or mild patients are becoming healthy with regular over-the-counter medicines and  proper rest and care, for the severe patients, in the absence of definite cure,  different drug combinations are being used to treat on trial basis without the  assurance of efficacy and safety. This scenario has however changed now with some  medicines including antiviral Remdesivir and Favipiravir and anti-inflammatory  drugs like dexamethasone and tocilizumab which have shown some positive results  in trials such as decreasing need of mechanical or non-invasive ventilation or  mortality. Further, a number of vaccine candidates are currently in pipeline and  in advance stages of clinical trials, which will enhance their prospects in  determining how the disease will be controlled in the times to come. In this  article, an account of the under-trial potential drugs and vaccine candidates has  been provided, and their future prospects have been discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a lethal zoonotic disease caused by an RNA virus that is a member of the Nairovirus genus in the  Bunyaviridae family from the arbovirus group. CCHF is transmitted by Hyalomma  ticks through direct contact with the blood and other bodily fluids of patients  or infected animals. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 65-year-old man was admitted to the  emergency unit with dry cough, myalgia and fever. He was treated with  favipiravir. He had disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia  in the setting of COVID-19 infection. He tested positive for both COVID-19 and  CCHF. By the end of the fifth day of treatment, his laboratory parameters and  clinical symptoms had normalized. CONCLUSION: Favipiravir is currently on the  market for treating COVID-19 infection worldwide. It has also been used to treat  CCHF in laboratory animals. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report  of CCHF successfully treated with favipiravir, which could be a key drug for  treating human CCHF. LEARNING POINTS: Clinicians should be alert for concomitant  viral infections such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, which share similar  clinical and laboratory findings to COVID-19.The effectiveness of favipiravir for  viral infections other than influenza and COVID-19, such as Crimean-Congo  haemorrhagic fever, should be elucidated.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: No proven drug and no immunisation are yet available for COVID-19 disease. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a key coronavirus enzyme, which is  a potential drug target, has been successfully crystallised. There is evidence  suggesting that statins exert anti-viral activity and may block the infectivity  of enveloped viruses. The aim of this study was to assess whether statins are  potential COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors, using a molecular docking study. MATERIAL AND  METHODS: Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock/Vina, a computational  docking program. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was docked with all statins, while antiviral and  antiretroviral drugs - favipiravir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir - were used as  standards for comparison. RESULTS: The binding energies obtained from the docking  of 6LU7 with native ligand favipiravir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, simvastatin,  rosuvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and  atorvastatin were -6.8, -5.8, -7.9, -7.9, -7.0, -7.7, -6.6, -8.2, -7.4, -7.7, and  -6.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The number of hydrogen bonds between statins and  amino acid residues of Mpro were 7, 4, and 3 for rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and  atorvastatin, respectively, while other statins had two hydrogen bonds.  CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate, based upon the binding energy of  pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin, that statins could be  efficient SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. This is supported by the fact that the  effects of some statins, especially pitavastatin, have a binding energy that is  even greater than that of protease or polymerase inhibitors. However, further  research is necessary to investigate their potential use as drugs for COVID-19.

AB  - A sensitive and selective UPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the synchronized determination of four drugs used in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 (SARS-CoV-2), namely, azithromycin, apixaban, dexamethasone, and favipiravir in  rat plasma. using a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 2.7 m) with a  high-resolution ESI tandem mass spectrometer detection with multiple reaction  monitoring. We used an Agilent Poroshell column, which is characterized by a  stationary phase based on non-porous core particles. With a remarkable  improvement in the number of theoretical plates and low column backpressure. In  addition, the developed method was employed in studying the potential food-drug  interaction of grapefruit juice (GFJ) with the selected drugs which affects their  pharmacokinetics in rats. The LC-MS/MS operated in positive and negative  ionization mode using two internal standards: moxifloxacin and chlorthalidone,  respectively. Liquid- liquid extraction of the cited drugs from rat plasma was  accomplished using diethyl ether: dichloromethane (70:30, v/v). The analytes were  separated using methanol: 0.1 % formic acid in water (95: 5, v/v) as a mobile  phase in isocratic mode of elution pumped at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. A  detailed validation of the bio-analytical method was performed in accordance with  US-FDA and EMA guidelines. Concerning the in vivo pharmacokinetic study, the  statistical significance between the results of the test groups receiving GFJ  along with the cited drugs and the control group was assessed demonstrating that  GFJ increased the plasma concentration of azithromycin, apixaban, and  dexamethasone. Accordingly, this food-drug interaction requires cautious  ingestion of GFJ in patients using (SARS-CoV-2) medications as it can produce  negative effects in the safety of the drug therapy. A potential drug-drug  interaction is also suggested between those medications requiring a suitable dose  adjustment.

T2  - Journal of drug delivery science and technology
AB  - In 2019 the emergence of SARS-COV-2 caused pandemic situation worldwide and claimed ∼6.4 M lives (WHO 2022). Favipiravir (FAV) is recommended as a therapy  for Covid-19 which belongs to BCS class III with a short half-life of 2-5.5h.  Thus, the objective of current study was the development of favipiravir loaded  PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) by box-behnken design. Moreover, these NPs were  entrapped in thermosensitive gel to increase the permeation through nasal route.  The nanoparticles exhibit particle size of 175.6 ± 2 nm with >70 ± 0.5 %EE. NPs  showed PDI (0.130) and zeta potential (-17.1 mV) suggesting homogeneity and  stability of NPs. DSC, XRD, and FTIR studies concluded absence of any interaction  of FAV and the excipients. SEM and AFM studies demonstrated spherical morphology  of NPs with smooth surface. The NPs entrapped in-situ gel showed clarity and pH  5.5-6.1. The gelation temperature of NPs dispersed in-situ gel was found in the  range of 35 °C -37 °C. The gel has viscosity in range of 34592-4568 cps. The  texture analysis profile of gel showed good gelling properties. Dissolution study  suggested a sustained release of FAV from NPs (24h) and NPs dispersed gel (32h)  as compared to FAV solution (4h). The gel showed good mucoadhesion properties  (9373.9 dyne/cm(2)). Ex-vivo permeation through nasal mucosa of goat elucidated  NPs dispersed gel demonstrated significantly higher permeation than solution and  NPs. Therefore, it would be a prospective formulation to combat Covid-19  infection with high patient compliance.

AB  - COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) is a contagious illness that has been declared a global epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The  coronavirus causes diseases ranging in severity from the common cold to severe  respiratory diseases and death. Coronavirus primarily affects blood pressure by  attaching to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor. This virus has  an impact on multiple organ systems, including the central nervous system, immune  system, cardiovascular system, peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract,  endocrine system, urinary system, skin, and pregnancy. For the prevention of  COVID-19, various vaccines such as viral-like particle vaccines, entire  inactivated virus vaccines, viral vector vaccines, live attenuated virus  vaccines, subunit vaccines, RNA vaccines, and DNA vaccines are now available.  Some of the COVID-19 vaccines are reported to cause a variety of adverse effects  that range from mild to severe in nature. SARS-CoV-2 replication is controlled by  the RNA-Dependent RNA-Polymerase enzyme (RdRp). The availability of FDA-approved  anti-RdRp drugs (Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir)  as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that tightly bind to its RdRp may aid in the  treatment of patients and reduce the risk of the mysterious new form of COVID-19  viral infection. RdRp inhibitors, such as remdesivir (an anti-Ebola virus  experimental drug) and favipiravir (an anti-influenza drug), inhibit RdRp and  thus slow the progression of COVID-19 and associated clinical symptoms, as well  as significantly shorten recovery time. Molnupiravir, an orally active RdRp  inhibitor and noval broad spectrum antiviral agent, is an isopropyl pro-drug of  EIDD-1931 for emergency use. Galidesivir's in vitro and in vivo activities are  limited to RNA of human public health concern. Top seeds for antiviral treatments  with high potential to combat the SARS-CoV-2 strain include guanosine derivatives  (IDX-184), setrobuvir, and YAK. The goal of this review is to compile scattered  information on available COVID-19 vaccines and other treatments for protecting  the human body from their harmful effects and to provide options for making  better choices in a timely manner.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide since early 2020, and there are still no signs of resolution. The Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines  for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock (J-SSCG) 2020 Special Committee  created the Japanese rapid/living recommendations on drug management for COVID-19  using the experience of creating the J-SSCGs. The Grades of Recommendation,  Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to determine  the certainty of the evidence and strength of the recommendations. The first  edition of this guideline was released on 9 September, 2020, and this document is  the revised edition (version 3.1) (released 30 March, 2021). Clinical questions  (CQs) were set for the following seven drugs: favipiravir (CQ1), remdesivir  (CQ2), hydroxychloroquine (CQ3), corticosteroids (CQ4), tocilizumab (CQ5),  ciclesonide (CQ6), and anticoagulants (CQ7). Favipiravir is recommended for  patients with mild COVID-19 not requiring supplemental oxygen (GRADE 2C);  remdesivir for moderate COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental  oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2B). Hydroxychloroquine is not recommended for all  COVID-19 patients (GRADE 1B). Corticosteroids are recommended for moderate  COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 1B) and  severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator management/intensive care (GRADE  1A); however, their use is not recommended for mild COVID-19 patients not  requiring supplemental oxygen (GRADE 1B). Tocilizumab is recommended for moderate  COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2B).  Anticoagulant therapy is recommended for moderate COVID-19 patients requiring  supplemental oxygen/hospitalization and severe COVID-19 patients requiring  ventilator management/intensive care (GRADE 2C). We hope that these clinical  practice guidelines will aid medical professionals involved in the care of  COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Acute Psychosis in COVID-19: Is It Due to Favipiravir Treatment or Acute Viral Illness?
AU  - Duyan, Murat

T2  - SN comprehensive clinical medicine
AB  - In this report, we present a case of acute psychosis that occurred after the loading dose of favipiravir, one of the most prescribed antiviral drugs in many  countries, in a patient with COVID-19. A 31-year-old female was readmitted to the  emergency department after 3 days of sleep disturbance, intermittent paranoid  delusions, auditory hallucinations, and agitation that started after the  favipiravir treatment was initiated. A physical examination revealed disorganized  speech, distorted orientation, and agitation. All laboratory tests, including  drug screening and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, were normal. After excluding all  the other causes of acute psychosis, favipiravir treatment was discontinued,  antipsychotic treatment was started, and the patient was admitted to the  psychiatric ward. The symptoms resolved on the second day of hospitalization.  Although acute viral illness does seldomly cause psychosis in patients with  increased inflammatory response, in the presented case, none of the inflammatory  markers were positive, and acute psychosis was attributed to the loading dose of  favipiravir. In conclusion, clinicians should be aware of this rare adverse  effect and prescribe cautiously to patients at a high risk of psychosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The administration of systemic corticosteroids is a key strategy for improving COVID-19 outcomes. However, evidence is lacking on combination  therapies of antiviral agents and systemic corticosteroids. The objective of this  study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of  favipiravir and methylprednisolone in preventing respiratory failure progression  in patients with COVID-19 and non-critical respiratory failure. METHODS: We  conducted a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase II study. The patients  received favipiravir 3600 mg on the first day, followed by 1600 mg for a total of  10-14 days. Methylprednisolone was administered intravenously at 1 mg/ideal body  weight (IBW)/day from days 1 to 5, followed by 0.5 mg/IBW/day from days 6 to 10  if clinically indicated. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients  requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) (including noninvasive positive pressure  ventilation) or those who met the criteria for tracheal intubation within 14 days  of the study treatment initiation (MVCTI-14). RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were  enrolled and underwent the study treatment. Of them, the MVCTI-14 proportion was  29.2% (90% confidence interval 20.1-39.9, p = 0.200). The proportion of patients  who required MV or who died within 30 days was 26.2%, and 30-day mortality was  4.9%. The most significant risk factor for MVCTI-14 was a smoking history (odds  ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2-14.2). The most common grade 3-4  treatment-related adverse event was hyperglycemia, which was observed in 21.7%.  CONCLUSION: The MVCTI-14 proportion did not reach a favorable level in the  clinical trial setting with the threshold of 35%. However, the proportion of MV  or death within 30 days was 26.6%, which might be close to the findings (28.1%)  of the RECOVERY trial, which showed the efficacy of dexamethasone for patients  with COVID-19 and non-critical respiratory failure. Further evaluation of this  combination therapy is needed. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Japan Registry of  Clinical Trials (jRCT) identifier jRCTs041200025.

AB  - To date, there is no final FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19. There are thousands of studies published on the available treatments for COVID-19 virus in  the past year. Therefore, it is crucial to synthesize and summarize the evidence  from published studies on the safety and efficacy of experimental treatments of  COVID-19. We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, PubMed,  Cochrane Library, GHL, OpenGrey, ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases through  April 2020. We obtained 2699 studies from the initial literature search. Of them,  we included 28 eligible studies that met our eligibility criteria. The sample  size of the included studies is 2079 individuals. We extracted and pooled the  available data and conducted a quality assessment for the eligible studies. From  the 28 studies, only 13 studies provide strong evidence. Our results showed that  Favipiravir and Hydroxycholoroquine shorten viral clearance and clinical recovery  time and promote pneumonia absorption. On the other hand, Lopinavir-ritonavir  either alone or combined with arbidol or interferons has no significant  difference superior to the standard care. Corticosteroids, Convalescent plasma  transfusion, and anticoagulant therapies provide a better prognosis. Remedsivir,  Tocilizumab, Immunoglobulin, Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation showed  effective treatment results, but further confirmatory studies are needed. In  conclusion, Favipiravir and Remedsivir might be promising drugs in the treatment  of COVID-19 patients. .

AB  - In the current pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), computational drug discovery can play an essential role in finding potential therapeutic  agents. Thanks to its anti-viral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory  properties, sage (Salvia officinalis) is used in traditional medicine. In this  study, drugs proposed against COVID-19, including Lopinavir, Remdesivir,  Favipiravir, and main flavonoids of sage, were docked favorably against novel  coronavirus main protease. Molecular docking findings indicate that Rutin,  Luteolin-7-glucoside, Apigenin, and Hispidulin make strong interactions with  better binding affinity than selected commercial drugs in the study. But Rutin is  the only flavonoid that makes strong hydrogen bond interactions with catalytic  dyad and crucial M(pro) residues and has more binding affinity than protease  inhibitor PF-07321332 as an oral antiviral (PAXLOVID™). Further analysis of  Molecular Dynamics and MM-PBSA predicted that chosen ligands could form stable  complexes with the main protease. Also, ADMET analysis shows that main flavonoids  are expected to have appropriate pharmacokinetic and no toxic properties. The  results of the in silico study suggest that Salvia officinalis as a rich source  of potent anti-coronavirus flavonoids may play a significant role in  counteracting the replication of SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - COVID-19, transmitted by SARS-CoV-2, is one of the most serious pandemic situations in the history of mankind, and has already infected a huge population  across the globe. This horrendously contagious viral outbreak was first  identified in China and within a very short time it affected the world's health,  transport, economic, and academic sectors. Despite the recent approval of a few  anti-COVID-19 vaccines, their unavailability and insufficiency along with the  lack of other potential therapeutic options are continuing to worsen the  situation, with valuable lives continuing to be lost. In this situation,  researchers across the globe are focusing on repurposing prospective drugs and  prophylaxis such as favipiravir, remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine,  ivermectin, lopinavir-ritonavir, azithromycin, doxycycline, ACEIs/ARBs,  rivaroxaban, and protease inhibitors, which were preliminarily based on in vitro  and in vivo pharmacological and toxicological study reports followed by clinical  applications. Based on available preliminary data derived from limited clinical  trials, the US National Institute of Health (NIH) and USFDA also recommended a  few drugs to be repurposed i.e., hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and favipiravir.  However, World Health Organization later recommended against the use of  chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in the  treatment of COVID-19 infections. Combining basic knowledge of viral pathogenesis  and pharmacodynamics of drug molecules as well as in silico approaches, many drug  candidates have been investigated in clinical trials, some of which have been  proven to be partially effective against COVID-19, and many of the other drugs  are currently under extensive screening. The repurposing of prospective drug  candidates from different stages of evaluation can be a handy wellspring in  COVID-19 management and treatment along with approved anti-COVID-19 vaccines.  This review article combined the information from completed clinical trials, case  series, cohort studies, meta-analyses, and retrospective studies to focus on the  current status of repurposing drugs in 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant recipients are considered to be at high-risk of developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related complications. The  optimal treatment for this patient group is unknown. Consequently, the treatment  of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients should be determined individually,  considering patient age and comorbidities, as well as graft function, time of  transplant, and immunosuppressive treatment. Immunosuppressive treatments may  give rise to severe COVID-19. On the contrary, they may also lead to a milder and  atypical presentation by diminishing the immune system overdrive. CASE SUMMARY: A  50-year old female kidney transplant recipient presented to the transplant clinic  with a progressive dry cough and fever that started three days ago. Although the  COVID-19 test was found to be negative, chest computed tomography images showed  consolidation typical of the disease; thus, following hospital admission,  anti-bacterial and COVID-19 treatments were initiated. However, despite clinical  improvement of the lung consolidation, her creatinine levels continued to  increase. Ultrasound of the graft showed no pathology. The tacrolimus blood level  was determined and the elevation in creatinine was found to be related to an  interaction between tacrolimus and azithromycin. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19  pandemic, various single or combination drugs have been utilized to find an  effective treatment regimen. This has increased the possibility of drug  interactions. A limited number of studies published in the literature have  highlighted some of these pharmacokinetic interactions. Treatments used for  COVID-19 therapy; azithromycin, atazanavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir,  favipiravir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, ribavirin, and  tocilizumab, interact with immunosuppressive treatments, most importantly with  calcineurin inhibitors. Thus, their levels should be frequently monitored to  prevent toxicity.

AB  - Background: In the absence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral treatments, various repurposed pharmaceutical approaches are under investigation for the treatment of  COVID-19. Antiviral drugs considered for this condition include atazanavir,  remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, and favipiravir. Whilst the combination of  lopinavir and ritonavir has been previously linked to prolongation of the QT(c)  interval on the ECG and risk of torsades de pointes arrhythmia, less is known in  this regard about atazanavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir. Unwanted abnormalities  of drug-induced QT(c) prolongation by diverse drugs are commonly mediated by a  single cardiac anti-target, the hERG potassium channel. This computational  modeling study was undertaken in order to explore the ability of these five drugs  to interact with known determinants of drug binding to the hERG channel pore.  Methods: Atazanavir, remdesivir, ritonavir, lopinavir and favipiravir were docked  to in silico models of the pore domain of hERG, derived from cryo-EM structures  of hERG and the closely related EAG channel. Results: Atazanavir was readily  accommodated in the open hERG channel pore in proximity to the S6 Y652 and F656  residues, consistent with published experimental data implicating these aromatic  residues in atazanavir binding to the channel. Lopinavir, ritonavir, and  remdesivir were also accommodated in the open channel, making contacts in a  model-dependent fashion with S6 aromatic residues and with residues at the base  of the selectivity filter/pore helix. The ability of remdesivir (at 30 μM) to  inhibit the channel was confirmed using patch-clamp recording. None of these four  drugs could be accommodated in the closed channel structure. Favipiravir, a much  smaller molecule, was able to fit within the closed channel and could adopt  multiple binding poses in the open channel, but with few simultaneous  interactions with key binding residues. Only favipiravir and remdesivir showed  the potential to interact with lateral pockets below the selectivity filter of  the channel. Conclusions: All the antiviral drugs studied here can, in principle,  interact with components of the hERG potassium channel canonical binding site,  but are likely to differ in their ability to access lateral binding pockets.  Favipiravir's small size and relatively paucity of simultaneous interactions may  confer reduced hERG liability compared to the other drugs. Experimental  structure-function studies are now warranted to validate these observations.

AB  - A great demand for discovering new therapeutic solutions has been considered all over the world for managing the rapidly progressing COVID-19 pandemic. Remdesivir  (REM) and Favipiravir (FAV) are introduced as promising newly developed antiviral  agents against the corona virus as evidenced by the clinical findings. Hence, the  optimization of an analytical method for their simultaneous determination  acquires potential importance in quality control labs and further confirmatory  investigations. Herein, a green, sensitive, and selective densitometric method  has been proposed and validated for determination of REM and FAV in  pharmaceutical formulations and spiked human plasma on normal phase TLC plates. A  solvent mixture of ethyl acetate-methanol-ammonia (8:2:0.2 by volume) has been  chosen as developing mobile phase system. Well resolved spots have been detected  at 235 nm with retardation factors (R(f)) of 0.18 and 0.98 for REM and FAV,  respectively. A validation study has been carried out in the light of ICH  guidelines. Remdesivir and FAV have shown excellent sensitivities with  quantitation limits down to 0.12 and 0.07 μg/band, respectively. The developed  method has been successfully applied to tablet formulations and spiked plasma  with excellent recoveries ranged from 97.21 to 101.31%. The greenness of the  method has been evaluated using the standards of greenness profile and Eco-Scale.  It has passed the four greenness profile quadrants and achieved 80 score in  Eco-Scale.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus that causes a respiratory disease with variable severity and fatal consequences. It was first reported in Wuhan and  subsequently caused a global pandemic. The viral spike protein binds with the  ACE-2 cell surface receptor for entry, while TMPRSS2 triggers its membrane  fusion. In addition, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3'-5' exoribonuclease  (nsp14), viral proteases, N, and M proteins are important in different stages of  viral replication. Accordingly, they are attractive targets for different  antiviral therapeutic agents. Although many antiviral agents have been used in  different clinical trials and included in different treatment protocols, the mode  of action against SARS-CoV-2 is still not fully understood. Different potential  repurposed drugs, including, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin,  remdesivir, and favipiravir, were screened in the present study. Molecular  docking of these drugs with different SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, including spike  and membrane proteins, RdRp, nucleoproteins, viral proteases, and nsp14, was  performed. Moreover, the binding affinities of the human ACE-2 receptor and  TMPRSS2 to the different drugs were evaluated. Molecular dynamics simulation and  MM-PBSA calculation were also conducted. Ivermectin and remdesivir were found to  be the most promising drugs. Our results suggest that both these drugs utilize  different mechanisms at the entry and post-entry stages and could be considered  potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication.

AB  - In this study, we systematically investigated the electronic structure, spectroscopic (nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, Raman, electron ionization  mass spectrometry, UV-Vis, circular dichroism, and emission) properties, and  tautomerism of halogenated favipiravir compounds (fluorine, chlorine, and  bromine) from a computational perspective. Additionally, the effects of hydration  on the proton transfer mechanism of the tautomeric forms of the halogenated  favipiravir compounds are discussed. Our results suggest that spectroscopic  properties allow for the elucidation of such tautomeric forms. As is well-known,  the favipiravir compound has excellent antiviral properties and hence was  recently tested for the treatment of new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Through in  silico modeling, in the current study, we evaluate the role of such tautomeric  forms in order to consider the effect of drug-metabolism in the inhibition  process of the main protease (M(pro)) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of  SARS-CoV-2 virus. According to the molecular docking, all halogenated compounds  presented a better interaction energy than the co-crystallized active ligand  (-3.5 kcal mol(-1)) in the viral RdRp, in both wild-type (-6.3 to -6.5 kcal  mol(-1)) and variant (-5.4 to -5.6 kcal mol(-1)) models. The variant analyzed for  RdRp (Y176C) decreases the affinity of the keto form of the compounds in the  active site, and prevented the ligands from interacting with RNA. These findings  clearly indicated that all these compounds are promising as drug candidates for  this molecular target.

AB  - SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the new lung disease COVID-19 is closely related to SARS-CoV, and together with MERS-CoV are three new  human coronaviruses that emerged in the last 20 years. The COVID-19 outbreak is a  rapidly evolving situation with higher transmissibility and infectivity compared  with SARS and MERS. Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic or mild  symptoms to severe illness. The prevalent cause of mortality is pneumonia that  progresses to ARDS. The ongoing pandemic has already resulted in more than  135,000 deaths and an unprecedented burden on national health systems worldwide.  Pending the availability of a vaccine, there is a critical need to identify  effective treatments and a number of clinical trials have been implemented  worldwide. Trials are based on repurposed drugs that are already approved for  other infections, have acceptable safety profiles or have performed well in  animal studies against the other two deadly coronaviruses. Supportive care  remains the mainstay of therapy at present, as it is still unclear how well these  data can be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2. Most of those emerging re-introduced  drugs are administered to patients in the context of clinical trials. In this  review, we summarize the strategies currently employed in the treatment of  COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has recently declared a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic and a global health emergency. The pressure to  produce drugs and vaccines against the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the use  of some drugs such as azithromycin, chloroquine (sulfate and phosphate),  hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, favipiravir, remdesivir, ribavirin,  ivermectin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. However, reports from some of the clinical  trials with these drugs have proved detrimental on some COVID-19 infected  patients with side effects more of which cardiomyopathy, cardiotoxicity,  nephrotoxicity, macular retinopathy, and hepatotoxicity have been recently  reported. Realizing the need for potent and harmless therapeutic compounds to  combat COVID-19, we attempted in this study to find promising therapeutic  compounds against the imminent threat of this virus. In this current study, 16  derivatives of gallic acid were docked against five selected non-structural  proteins of SARS-COV-2 known to be a good target for finding small molecule  inhibitors against the virus, namely, nsp3, nsp5, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14. All  the protein crystal structures and 3D structures of the small molecules (16  gallic acid derivatives and 3 control drugs) were retrieved from the Protein  database (PDB) and PubChem server respectively. The compounds with lower binding  energy than the control drugs were selected and subjected to pharmacokinetics  screening using AdmetSAR server. RESULTS: 4-O-(6-galloylglucoside) gave binding  energy values of - 8.4, - 6.8, - 8.9, - 9.1, and - 7.5 kcal/mol against Mpro,  nsp3, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp15 respectively. Based on the ADMET profile,  4-O-(6-galloylglucoside) was found to be metabolized by the liver and has a very  high plasma protein binding. CONCLUSION: The result of this study revealed that  4-O-(6-galloylglucoside) could be a promising inhibitor against these SAR-Cov-2  proteins. However, there is still a need for further molecular dynamic  simulation, in vivo and in vitro studies to support these findings.

AB  - Hypercytokinemia induced by coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is associated with severe pulmonary involvement, which may lead to respiratory failure. These  conditions play an important role in the worsening of clinical symptoms in  patients with severe COVID-19. There is no established treatment for  hypercytokinemia. We report on two patients whose clinical symptoms improved  after direct hemoperfusion using polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column (PMX-DHP),  following the administration of the anti-inflammatory agent tocilizumab. Case A  was a 70-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite treatment with  ciclesonide and favipiravir, supplemental oxygen was administered due to the  worsening of dyspnea with tachypnea. Although tocilizumab was started on day 6,  the patient deteriorated into deoxygenation, presenting with the PaO(2)/F(I)O(2)  (P/F) ratio of 92. On days 8 and 10, the patient received PMX-DHP therapy. On day  11, his dyspnea improved. On day 13, his P/F ratio began to improve, and oxygen  therapy was discontinued on day 18. The patient recovered without requiring  mechanical ventilation. Case B was a 70-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19  pneumonia and treated with favipiravir, starting on day 0. Despite starting  ciclesonide inhalation and tocilizumab on day 2, his P/F ratio was 53. On day 5,  he received PMX-DHP therapy. On day 6, his dyspnea improved, as did his P/F  ratio, reaching 81 on day 8. Finally, his clinical symptoms resolved, and he was  discharged from the intensive care unit without requiring mechanical ventilation.  These cases indicate that PMX-DHP therapy might be a suitable treatment option  for dyspnea and deoxygenation in COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in cases where an  anti-inflammatory agent, such as tocilizumab, has failed to achieve the desired  effect.

AB  - Drugs targeting RNA respiratory viruses have resulted in few effective therapies, highlighting challenges for antivirals to treat COVID-19. Several antivirals are  being investigated for symptomatic COVID-19 but no definitive data support their  clinical use. Remdesivir appears to result in favorable outcomes with shortened  time to recovery and a modest decrease in mortality for hospitalized patients in  compassionate use series and some randomized controlled trials. Currently,  remdesivir is available only from the US government via an emergency use  authorization process. A randomized controlled trial of lopinavir/ritonavir  demonstrated no apparent clinical or virologic benefit and drug-drug interactions  and side effects further limit its utility. Antivirals to treat influenza  (oseltamivir) have limited activity against SARS-CoV-2, but favipiravir and  umifenovir, two influenza antivirals available internationally, may have distinct  viral targets and require further investigation. Antivirals with evidence of  clinical activity must be studied as treatment and prophylaxis for those at high  risk for severe COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare optical biometric measurements using optical biometry in patients with previously received COVID-19 treatment and a control  group. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients with previously received  COVID-19 treatment formed the COVID-19 group and age- and sex-matched healthy  participants formed the control group. Optical biometric measurements including  keratometry, corneal astigmatism, astigmatic axis, central corneal thickness,  anterior chamber depth, and axial length were made using a Nidek optical biometer  (AL-Scan; Nidek Co., Ltd., Japan). RESULTS: Measurements of keratometry  (p = 0.79), corneal astigmatism (p = 0.41), axial length (p = 0.96), anterior  chamber depth (p = 0.59), and central corneal thickness (p = 0.37) were similar  between the COVID-19 and control groups. The astigmatic axis type taken from  2.4 mm of the cornea showed significant difference between the two groups  (p = 0.02, χ(2)), while the measurements taken from 3.3 mm of the cornea were  similar (p = 0.10, χ(2)). In the subgroup analysis, axial length, anterior  chamber depth, and central corneal thickness measurements were found to be  statistically significantly higher in male patients of the COVID-19 group  (p = 0.02; p = 0.001; p = 0.02, t test). CONCLUSION: The changes in optical  biometric measurements found in our study were due to the fact that COVID-19 is  more frequent and severe in males, SARS-CoV‑2 can attach to the cornea via ACE‑2  receptors, and favipiravir can reach the aqueous humor. To our knowledge, there  is no study on this subject to date, and therefore more research is needed to  shed light on this topic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has overwhelmed health services globally. Oral antiviral therapies are licensed worldwide, but indications and efficacy rates vary. We  aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral favipiravir in patients  hospitalised with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, open-label,  randomised controlled trial of oral favipiravir in adult patients who were newly  admitted to hospital with proven or suspected COVID-19 across five sites in the  UK (n=2), Brazil (n=2) and Mexico (n=1). Using a permuted block design, eligible  and consenting participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral  favipiravir (1800 mg twice daily for 1 day; 800 mg twice daily for 9 days) plus  standard care, or standard care alone. All caregivers and patients were aware of  allocation and those analysing data were aware of the treatment groups. The  prespecified primary outcome was the time from randomisation to recovery,  censored at 28 days, which was assessed using an intention-to-treat approach.  Post-hoc analyses were used to assess the efficacy of favipiravir in patients  aged younger than 60 years, and in patients aged 60 years and older. The trial  was registered with clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04373733. FINDINGS: Between May 5,  2020 and May 26, 2021, we assessed 503 patients for eligibility, of whom 499 were  randomly assigned to favipiravir and standard care (n=251) or standard care alone  (n=248). There was no significant difference between those who received  favipiravir and standard care, relative to those who received standard care alone  in time to recovery in the overall study population (hazard ratio [HR] 1·06 [95%  CI 0·89-1·27]; n=499; p=0·52). Post-hoc analyses showed a faster rate of recovery  in patients younger than 60 years who received favipiravir and standard care  versus those who had standard care alone (HR 1·35 [1·06-1·72]; n=247; p=0·01). 36  serious adverse events were observed in 27 (11%) of 251 patients administered  favipiravir and standard care, and 33 events were observed in 27 (11%) of 248  patients receiving standard care alone, with infectious, respiratory, and  cardiovascular events being the most numerous. There was no significant  between-group difference in serious adverse events per patient (p=0·87).  INTERPRETATION: Favipiravir does not improve clinical outcomes in all patients  admitted to hospital with COVID-19, however, patients younger than 60 years might  have a beneficial clinical response. The indiscriminate use of favipiravir  globally should be cautioned, and further high-quality studies of antiviral  agents, and their potential treatment combinations, are warranted in COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the QT, QTc, and QTc dispersion changes that may occur with the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), favipiravir, and  moxifloxacin in combination or alone in COVID 19 patients. METHODS: This study  was retrospectively conducted on 193 inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. We  divided the patients into four separate groups due to their medications as,  group-1: favipiravir, group-2: favipiravir + HCQ, group-3: favipiravir +  moxifloxacin, and group-4: favipiravir + moxifloxacin + HCQ. We recorded their  pre and post-treatment QT parameters of each group and evaluated the changes of  these parameters with the SPSS statistical program. RESULTS: The mean age of the  patients was 63.1±17.7. In group 1 and 2, although there were slight changes in  QT parameters, these results were not statistically significant. In group 3,  significant increases in QT and QTc dispersion occurred (p=0.005 and p=0.018). In  the 4(th) group where the triple therapy was applied, there was a significant  increase only in the QTc values (p=0.027). When we compared the changes of QT  parameters for each group, a significant difference was found in ΔQTc dispersion,  and post hoc analysis showed that it was due to changes in the third group  (p=0.047). CONCLUSION: We thought that, if there is a COVID-19 infection with an  additional bacterial infection, and if there is a need of using moxifloxacin  alone or together with HCQ, additional risk factors that may cause QT interval  prolongation should be reviewed and ECG monitoring of the patients should be  performed during the treatment period.

AB  - The novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 infected by SARS-CoV-2 has attracted worldwide attention. It is urgent to find effective therapeutic strategies for  stopping COVID-19. In this study, a Bounded Nuclear Norm Regularization (BNNR)  method is developed to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates. First, three  virus-drug association datasets are compiled. Second, a heterogeneous virus-drug  network is constructed. Third, complete genomic sequences and Gaussian  association profiles are integrated to compute virus similarities; chemical  structures and Gaussian association profiles are integrated to calculate drug  similarities. Fourth, a BNNR model based on kernel similarity (VDA-GBNNR) is  proposed to predict possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. VDA-GBNNR is compared with  four existing advanced methods under fivefold cross-validation. The results show  that VDA-GBNNR computes better AUCs of 0.8965, 0.8562, and 0.8803 on the three  datasets, respectively. There are 6 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs overlapping in any two  datasets, that is, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, mycophenolic acid,  niclosamide, and mizoribine. Molecular dockings are conducted for the 6 small  molecules and the junction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. In particular, niclosamide and mizoribine show  higher binding energy of -8.06 and -7.06 kcal/mol with the junction,  respectively. G496 and K353 may be potential key residues between anti-SARS-CoV-2  drugs and the interface junction. We hope that the predicted results can  contribute to the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Since the outbreak and subsequent declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic in March 2020, concerted efforts have been applied by the scientific community to  curtail the spread of the disease and find a cure. While vaccines constitute a  vital part of the public health strategy to reduce the burden of COVID-19, the  management of this disease will continue to rely heavily on pharmacotherapy. This  study aims to provide an updated review of pharmacological agents that have been  developed and/or repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. To this end, a  comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Google Scholar,  and LitCovid databases. Relevant clinical studies on drugs used in the management  of COVID-19 were identified and evaluated in terms of evidence of efficacy and  safety. To date, the FDA has approved three therapies for the treatment of  COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorization: convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and  casirivimab/imdevimab (REGN-COV2). Drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir,  favipiravir, anakinra, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons,  tissue plasminogen activator, intravenous immunoglobulins, and nafamosat have  been used off-label with mixed therapeutic results. Adjunctive administration of  corticosteroids is also very common. The clinical experience with these approved  and repurposed drugs is limited, and data on efficacy for the new indication are  not strong. Overall, the response of the global scientific community to the  COVID-19 pandemic has been impressive, as evident from the volume of scientific  literature elucidating the molecular biology and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2  and the approval of three new drugs for clinical management. Reviewed studies  have shown mixed data on efficacy and safety of the currently utilized drugs. The  lack of standard treatment for COVID-19 has made it difficult to interpret  results from most of the published studies due to the risk of attribution error.  The long-term effects of drugs can only be assessed after several years of  clinical experience; therefore, the efficacy and safety of current COVID-19  therapeutics should continue to be rigorously monitored as part of post-marketing  studies.

AB  - The rapid spread and public health impact of the novel SARS-CoV-2 variants that cause COVID-19 continue to produce major global impacts and social distress.  Several vaccines were developed in record time to prevent and limit the spread of  the infection, thus playing a pivotal role in controlling the pandemic. Although  the repurposing of available drugs attempts to provide therapies of immediate  access against COVID-19, there is still a need for developing specific treatments  for this disease. Remdesivir, molnupiravir and Paxlovid remain the only  evidence-supported antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19 patients, and only in severe  cases. To contribute on the search of potential Covid-19 therapeutic agents, we  targeted the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the exoribonuclease  (ExoN) following two strategies. First, we modeled and analyzed nucleoside  analogs sofosbuvir, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, and molnupiravir at three  key binding sites on the RdRp-ExoN complex. Second, we curated and virtually  screened a database containing 517 nucleotide analogs in the same binding sites.  Finally, we characterized key interactions and pharmacophoric features presumably  involved in viral replication halting at multiple sites. Our results highlight  structural modifications that might lead to more potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors  against an expansive range of variants and provide a collection of nucleotide  analogs useful for screening campaigns.

AB  - The new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than 22.6 million people worldwide. Since the first day the virus was spotted in Wuhan, China,  numerous drug design studies have been conducted all over the globe. Most of  these studies target the receptor-binding domain of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2,  which is known to bind to the human ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 main protease,  vital for the virus' replication. However, there might be a third target, human  furin protease, which cleaves the virus' S1-S2 domains playing an active role in  its entry into the host cell. In this study, we docked five clinically used drug  molecules, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, and ritonavir  onto three target proteins, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike  protein, SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and human furin protease. Results of molecular  docking simulations revealed that human furin protease might be targeted by  COVID-19. Remdesivir, a nucleic acid derivative, strongly bound to the active  site of this protease, suggesting that this molecule can be used as a template  for designing novel furin protease inhibitors to fight against the disease.  Protein-drug interactions revealed in this study at the molecular level, can pave  the way for better drug design for each specific target.

AB  - While the world is in search of a vaccine that can cure COVID-19 disease, favipiravir is the most commonly used antiviral drug in the treatment of patients  during the pandemic process. In this study, we investigated the host-guest  interaction between the popular supramolecule calix[4]arene derivatives and the  favipiravir drug by using the DFT (Density Functional Theory) method. The B3LYP  hybrid method and 6-31G (d,p) basis set were utilized to determine the optimized  structures of the host and guest molecules and their complexes. The negative  adsorption energy (∆E) and adsorption enthalpy (∆H) calculated for the complexes  formed between calix[4]arene compounds and favipiravir drug molecule mentioned  that adsorption of favipiravir molecule was an exothermic process on  calix[4]arene structures. On the other hand, among the calixarene derivatives in  the study, Gibbs free energy change (∆G) value for the adsorption was only  negative on calix[4]arene4 molecule. The infrared spectroscopy (IR) calculations  were performed by examining the C=O, O-H and NH(2) vibrational frequencies to see  the adsorption behavior in the favipiravir-calix[4]arene complex. After  adsorption of the favipiravir molecule, HOMO-LUMO gap values decreased  significantly for the structures and therefore electrical conductivity increased  proportionally. In addition, sensor response factors, Fermi energy levels and  workfunction changes of calix[4]arene derivatives were calculated and examined.  Charge transfer between the four calix[4]arene compounds and the favipiravir  molecule has occurred after adsorption. This attributes that calix[4]arene  derivatives can be used as a well-suited favipiravir sensor (electronic and  workfunction) and adsorbent at room temperature. Based on the calculations made  to see the solvent effect on the adsorption of favipiravir it was determined that  it did not affect the interaction between the drug molecule and the calix[4]arene  compound too much and the adsorption energy turned into a slightly less negative  value.

AB  - Favipiravir is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 in the early stages of the disease. In this work, the solubility of  favipiravir was measured in supercritical CO(2) at temperatures ranging from 308  to 338 K and pressures ranging from 12 to 30 MPa. The mole fraction solubility of  favipiravir was in the range of 3.0 × 10(-6) to 9.05 × 10(-4). The solubility  data were correlated with three types of methods including; (a) density-based  models (Chrastil, Garlapati and Madras, Sparks et al., Sodeifian et al., K-J and  Keshmiri et al.), (b) Equations of states SRK with quadratic mixing rules) and  (c) expanded liquid theory (modified Wilson model). According to the results,  modified Wilson and K-J models are generally capable of providing good  correlation of solubility. Finally, the approximate values of total ( ΔHtotal ),  vaporization ( ΔHvap ), and solvation ( ΔHsol ) enthalpies were computed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) still causes a high rate of death globally with no definite curative treatment described. The traditional  plant Borage (Borago officinalis L.) is a good source of gamma-linolenic (GLA).  We hypothesized that Borage plus syrup (BPS) would be beneficial in severe  COVID-19 patients within an intensive care unit (ICU) setting. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: A pilot single center, randomized trial with no placebo was undertaken.  A total of 60 PCR-positive severe COVID-19 participants admitted to ICU from June  2020-December 2020 at Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran-Iran gave informed  consent. The participants were randomly assigned to either Borage Plus Syrup  (BPS, 5 ml for 5 days) (n = 30) or standard care (IFN-β and favipiravir) as a  control group (n = 30). Pao2/Fio2, serum ferritin, CRP, bilirubin, IL-6, TNF-α,  ALT, AST, PCT and serum IL-8 was measured upon admission and on release. RESULTS:  All the measured parameters decreased significantly with BPS treatment. In the  control group, most parameters significantly improved apart from AST and PCT. In  addition, the suppression of serum TNF levels in the BPS group was greater than  that seen in the control group (P ≤ 0.05). Moreover, the length of ICU stay was  significantly lower in the BPS group compared with the control group (P ≤ 0.05).  CONCLUSION: Our study shows that addition of BPS to the standard treatment regime  of COVID-19 patients in ICU improved outcomes and reduced the length of ICU  treatment. Natural products could be considered as new approaches for reducting  the harmful consequences of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who receive dialysis therapy develop more severe disease and have a poorer prognosis than  patients who do not. Although various data on the treatment of patients not  receiving dialysis therapy have been reported, clinical practice for patients on  dialysis is challenging as data is limited. The Infection Control Committee of  the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy decided to clarify the status of  treatment in COVID-19 patients on dialysis. METHODS: A questionnaire survey of  105 centers that had treated at least five COVID-19 patients on dialysis was  conducted in August 2021. RESULTS: Sixty-six centers (62.9%) responded to the  questionnaire. Antivirals were administered in 27.7% of facilities treating mild  disease (most patients received favipiravir) and 66.7% of facilities treating  moderate disease (most patients with moderate or more severe conditions received  remdesivir). Whether and how remdesivir is administered varies between centers.  Steroids were initiated most frequently in moderate II disease (50.8%), while  43.1% of the facilities initiated steroids in mild or moderate I disease. The  type of steroid, dose, and the duration of administration were generally  consistent, with most facilities administering dexamethasone 6 mg orally or  6.6 mg intravenously for 10 days. Steroid pulse therapy was administered in 48.5%  of the facilities, and tocilizumab was administered in 25.8% of the facilities,  mainly to patients on ventilators or equivalent medications, or to the cases of  exacerbations. Furthermore, some facilities used a polymethylmethacrylate  membrane during dialysis, nafamostat as an anticoagulant, and continuous  hemodiafiltration in severe cases. There was limited experience of polymyxin  B-immobilized fiber column-direct hemoperfusion and extracorporeal membrane  oxygenation. The discharge criteria for patients receiving dialysis therapy were  longer than those set by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in 22.7% of  the facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey revealed a variety of treatment practices  in each facility. Further evidence and innovations are required to improve the  prognosis of patients with COVID-19 receiving dialysis therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease patients on hemodialysis (CKD-5D) are among the worst hit by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Need to travel  for dialysis, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive state put them at risk of  severe disease and poor outcomes. We report our experience of COVID-19 in a  cohort of CKD-5D from a public sector tertiary-care center from western India.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 58 CKD-5D  patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our COVID-19 hospital. Suspected  COVID-19, acute kidney injury (AKI), or AKI on CKD were excluded. We studied the  clinical, demographic, radiological, and laboratory profiles; treatment; and  outcomes of the patients. We assessed the potential clinical and laboratory  parameters to predict mortality. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 48.7 ±  16.9 years, with 55% males. Comorbidities included hypertension (65%), diabetes  (19%), and cardiovascular disease (15.5%). The presenting features included fever  (69%), respiratory distress (50%), upper respiratory symptoms (36%), and diarrhea  (13%). Five (8.6%) were asymptomatic. Bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging were  the commonest radiological pattern. The patients were managed with oxygenation,  hydroxychloroquine, steroids, anticoagulation, remdesivir, and favipiravir.  Twenty-two (37.9%) patients died, predominantly due to respiratory failure.  Disease severity and C-reactive protein (CRP) above 175 mg/L at admission were  the only parameters predictive of mortality. CONCLUSION: CKD-5D patients with  COVID-19 were less likely to present with the classical syndrome of fever and  respiratory distress compared with reports from the general population and had  higher mortality. Only disease severity and high CRP (>175 mg/L) were predictive  of mortality in our cohort.

AB  - Introduction: The severity of COVID-19 may be correlated with the risk of liver injury development. An increasing number of studies indicate that degrees of  hepatotoxicity has been associated with using some medications in the management  of COVID-19 patients. However, limited studies had systematically investigated  the evidence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in COVID-19 patients. Thus, this  study aimed to examine DILI in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic search  was carried out in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to December 30,  2020. Search items included "SARS-CoV-2", "Coronavirus," COVID-19, and liver  injury. Results: We included 22 related articles. Among included studies, there  was five case report, five case series, four randomizes control trial (RCT),  seven cohort studies, and one cross-sectional study. The drugs included in this  systematic review were remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine,  and lopinavir/ritonavir. Among included studies, some studies revealed a direct  role of drugs, while others couldn't certainly confirm that the liver injury was  due to SARS-CoV-2 itself or administration of medications. However, a significant  number of studies reported that liver injury could be attributable to drug  administration. Discussion: Liver injury in COVID-19 patients could be caused by  the virus itself or the administration of some types of drug. Intensive liver  function monitoring should be considered for patients, especially patients who  are treated with drugs such as remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tocilizumab.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health challenge with understudied effects on antimicrobial usage. We aimed to analyze antimicrobial prescribing  patterns in COVID-19 patients in Russian multi-field hospitals by means of the  Global-PPS Project developed by the University of Antwerp. Out of 999 patients in  COVID-19 wards in six hospitals surveyed in 2021, 51.3% received antimicrobials  (79% in intensive care, 47.5% in medical wards). Systemic antivirals and  antibiotics were prescribed to 31% and 35.1% of patients, respectively, and a  combination of both to 14.1% of patients. The top antivirals administered were  favipiravir (65%), remdesivir (19.2%), and umifenovir (15.8%); the top  antibiotics were ceftriaxone (29.7%), levofloxacin (18%), and  cefoperazone/sulbactam (10.4%). The vast majority of antibiotics was prescribed  for treatment of pneumonia or COVID-19 infection (59.3% and 25.1%, respectively).  Treatment was based on biomarker data in 42.7% of patients but was targeted only  in 29.6% (6.7% for antibiotics). The rate of non-compliance with guidelines  reached 16.6%. Antimicrobial prescribing patterns varied considerably in COVID-19  wards in Russian hospitals with groundlessly high rates of systemic antibiotics.  Antimicrobial usage surveillance and stewardship should be applied to inpatient  care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AU  - Abduljabbar, Maram H.
T2  - Annals of medicine and surgery (2012)
AB  - Alleviation and treatment of the extensive detrimental implications of COVID-19 have materialised into the primary objectives of scientists and virologists along  with pathologists assigned with the responsibility of provisioning of care for  infected patients. Development and introduction of vaccines have been, till to  date, primarily at the prototypical phase. The significance of utilisation of  combined drug therapies has been considered to be paramount from the perspective  of application of clinical information collected from previous viral epidemics.  One prospective treatment application has involved the Multi Drug Therapy (MDT)  based approach with utilisation of the combination of drugs Nafamostat Mesylate  and Favipiravir with the purpose of reduction of the infectious intensity of  COVID-19 viral strain. On account of the extensive prevalence of patients  becoming infected with the Novel Coronavirus strain, MDT procedures have been  mostly favoured by scientists and clinical virologists with the explicit  objective of determination of the probability of such combined drug therapies in  terms of assisting the recovery of COVID-19 infected patients. The previous  researches conducted on the procedural particulars of treatments regarding  effective antidote development for COVID-19 infected patients had brought forth  various clinical outcomes on such innovative treatment initiatives concerning the  observed effects of MDTs on such patients. The corresponding research literature  review endeavour has been oriented towards collecting information regarding 2  specifically utilised medicinal substances (the previously mentioned Nafamostat  Mesylate and Favipiravir drugs) for treatment purposes of COVID-19 infected  individuals. Such drugs generally are associated with pharmaceutical categories  such as antivirals, immune modulators, antibiotics and anticoagulants. These  compounds have been utilised in a direct manner by hospital inpatients and such  occurrences have permitted the researchers to examine the implications of such  drugs on health conditions of COVID-19 patients in laboratory conditions as well.  The corresponding study has been responsible for considering the clinical  research findings of the combination of such drugs through comparison of observed  outcomes.

AB  - Coronaviruses have caused serious Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)  outbreaks, and only remdesivir has been recently indicated for the treatment of  COVID-19. In the line of therapeutic options for SARS and MERS, this study aims  to summarize the current clinical evidence of treatment options for COVID-19. In  general, the combination of antibiotics, ribavirin, and corticosteroids was  considered as a standard treatment for patients with SARS. The addition of this  conventional treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon, and convalescent  plasma showed potential clinical improvement. For patients with MERS, ribavirin,  lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon, and convalescent plasma were continuously  recommended. However, a high-dose of corticosteroid was suggested for severe  cases only. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma was commonly  reported. There was limited evidence for the effect of corticosteroids, other  antiviral drugs like ribavirin, and favipiravir. Monoclonal antibody of  tocilizumab and antimalarial agents of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were  also introduced. Among antibiotics for infection therapy, azithromycin was  suggested. In conclusion, this study showed the up-to-date evidence of treatment  options for COVID-19 that is helpful for the therapy selection and the  development of further guidelines and recommendations. Updates of on-going  clinical trials and observational studies may confirm the current findings.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Various skin findings due to coronavirus have been identified. There are a few case reports on nail findings after coronavirus (COVID-19)  infection. We aimed to document the nail findings of the COVID-19 survivors and  shed light on the interesting luminescence seen under the Wood's light. METHODS:  One hundred and seventy-four patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in the  last 100 days were grouped in terms of the agents used in the treatment.  Fifty-seven volunteers without a history of infection were included. RESULTS:  Patients treated with favipiravir had a significantly higher positivity of  luminescence (p: 0.0001). The most common nail findings in patients were splinter  hemorrhage (13%), followed by leukonychia (12%) and longitudinal ridges (7.9%).  DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: The luminescence may be seen due to the accumulation of  favipiravir or its excipients (titanium dioxide and yellow ferric oxide) on the  nails. Wood's lamp examination of the plasma taken from a patient after  favipiravir's first dose revealed the same luminescence as we saw on the nails.  Accordingly, this accumulation may be seen in the vital organs. Although our  knowledge about the virus increases day by day, the potentially hazardous effects  of the virus and long-term complications of the treatment options are still being  investigated.

AB  - Due the current pandemic of COVID-19, an urgent need is required for serious medical treatments of a huge number of patients. The world health organization  (WHO) approved Favipiravir (FAV) as a medication for patients infected with  corona virus. In the current study, we report the first simple electrochemical,  greatly sensitive sensor using MnO(2)-rGO nanocomposite for the accurate  determination of Favipiravir (FAV). The developed sensor showed a high  improvement in the electrochemical oxidation of FAV comparing to the unmodified  screen-printed electrode (SPE). The suggested platform constituents and the  electrochemical measurements parameters were studied. Under optimal experimental  parameters, a current response to the concentration change of FAV was found to be  in the linear range of 1.0 × 10(-8)-5.5 × 10(-5) M at pH 7.0 with a limit of  detection 0.11 µM and a quantification limit of 0.33 µM. The developed platform  was confirmed by the precise analysis of FAV in real samples including dosage  form and plasma. The developed platform can be applied in different fields of  industry quality control and clinical analysis laboratories for the FAV  determination.

AB  - Background: The emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic has resulted in the need for urgent development of vaccines and drugs and the conduction of clinical trials to  fight the outbreak. Because of the time constraints associated with the  development of vaccines and effective drugs, drug repurposing and other  alternative treatment methods have been used to treat patients that have been  infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have acquired COVID-19. Objective: The  objective of this systematic scoping review is to provide an overview of the  molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs or alternative treatment  medicines used to attenuate COVID-19 disease. Method: The research articles or  gray literature, including theses, government reports, and official news online,  were identified from four databases and one search engine. The full content of a  total of 160 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria was analyzed and  information about six drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir,  favipiravir, and chloroquine) and four Traditional Chinese Medicines (Shuang  Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye, TCM combination of Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San and Da Yuan  Yin, Xue Bi Jing Injection, and Qing Fei Pai Du Tang) was extracted. Results: All  of the repurposed drugs and complementary medicine that have been used for the  treatment of COVID-19 depend on the ability of the drug to inhibit the  proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by binding to enzyme active sites, viral  chain termination, or triggering of the molecular pathway, whereas Traditional  Chinese Medicine plays a pivotal role in triggering the inflammation pathway,  such as the neuraminidase blocker, to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In December 2021, Omicron replaced Delta as the dominant coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) variant in Thailand. Both variants embody diverse  epidemiological trends and immunogenicity. We investigated whether Delta and  Omicron patients' biological and clinical characteristics and immunogenicity  differed post-COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study  investigated the clinical outcomes and laboratory data of 5181 patients with  mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (Delta, 2704; Omicron, 2477) under home isolation. We  evaluated anti-receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G (anti-RBD IgG) and  surrogate viral neutralizing (sVNT) activity in 495 individuals post-COVID-19  infection during the Delta pandemic. RESULTS: Approximately 84% of all patients  received favipiravir. The median cycle threshold (Ct) values were lower for  Omicron patients than Delta patients (19 vs. 21; p &lt; 0.001), regardless of  vaccination status. Upper respiratory tract symptoms were more frequent with  Omicron patients than Delta patients. There were no significant associations  between Ct and Omicron symptoms (95% confidence interval 0.98-1.02). A two-dose  vaccine regimen reduced hospital readmission by 10% to 30% and death by under 1%.  Anti-RBD IgG and sVNT against Delta were higher among older individuals  post-COVID-19 infection. Older individuals expressed anti-RBD IgG and sVNT for a  more extended period after two-dose vaccination than other age groups.  CONCLUSIONS: After a full vaccination course, breakthrough mild-to-moderate Delta  and Omicron infections have limited immunogenicity. Prior infections exert  reduced protection against later reinfection or infection from novel variants.  However, this protection may be sufficient to prevent hospitalization and death,  particularly in countries where vaccine supplies are limited.

AB  - COVID-19 is a disease caused by a novel coronavirus with no specific, standard treatment. We investigated the clinical data of COVID-19 patients admitted to  King Fahad Specialist Hospital (KFSH) in Buraydah by comparing the patients who  were treated early with favipiravir (within 3 days of admission) to patients who  were treated after three days of admission or not treated. 165 patients were  confirmed with PCR tests and admitted to KFSH for treatment. Comorbidities  contributed significantly to increasing the length of stay in hospital at  11.4 ± 0.8 days compared to patients with no comorbidities at 8.6 ± 0.9 days  (p=0.041). A total of 103 patients were treated with favipiravir, and we found  that early treatment with favipiravir (within 3 days) reduced the length of stay  in hospital significantly (8.8 ± 1.4 days) compared to patients who were treated  after 3 days (13.3 ± 4.6 days) (p=0.0015). Moreover, patients with comorbidities  in both early and late treatment groups had significantly higher average lengths  of stay in hospital (11.2 ± 0.9 days) compared to patients with no comorbidities  (7.9 ± 0.7 days) (p=0.017). Interestingly, patients treated early with  favipiravir (with comorbidities and without) stayed fewer days in hospital  compared to those with late treatment (p=0.021; a difference of 4.5 ± 1.9 days;  and p=0.018; a difference of 4.2 ± 1.7 days, respectively). In conclusion, our  analysis indicates that early treatment with favipiravir can reduce the length of  stay in hospital and improve clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the globe in no time. In the beginning, people suffered due to the absence of efficacious drugs required to treat severely ill  patients. Nevertheless, still, there are no established therapeutic molecules  against the SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, repurposing of the drugs started against  SARS-CoV-2, due to which several drugs were approved for the treatment of  COVID-19 patients. This paper reviewed the treatment regime for COVID-19 through  drug repurposing from December 8, 2019 (the day when WHO recognized COVID-19 as a  pandemic) until today. We have reviewed all the clinical trials from RECOVERY  trials, ACTT-1 and ACTT-2 study group, and other major clinical trial platforms  published in highly reputed journals such as NEJM, Lancet, etc. In addition to  single-molecule therapy, several combination therapies were also evaluated to  understand the treatment of COVID-19 from these significant clinical trials. To  date, several lessons have been learned on the therapeutic outcomes for COVID-19.  The paper also outlines the experiences gained during the repurposing of  therapeutic molecules (hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir/ lopinavir, favipiravir,  remdesivir, ivermectin, dexamethasone, camostatmesylate, and heparin),  immunotherapeutic molecules (tocilizumab, mavrilimumab, baricitinib, and  interferons), combination therapy, and convalescent plasma therapy to treat  COVID-19 patients. We summarized that anti-viral therapeutic (remdesivir) and  immunotherapeutic (tocilizumab, dexamethasone, and baricitinib) therapy showed  some beneficial outcomes. Until March 2021, 4952 clinical trials have been  registered in ClinicalTrials.gov toward the drug and vaccine development for  COVID-19. More than 100 countries have participated in contributing to these  clinical trials. Other than the registered clinical trials (medium to  large-size), several small-size clinical trials have also been conducted from  time to time to evaluate the treatment of COVID-19. Four molecules showed  beneficial therapeutic to treat COVID-19 patients. The short-term repurposing of  the existing drug may provide a successful outcome for COVID-19 patients.  Therefore, more clinical trials can be initiated using potential anti-viral  molecules by evaluating in different phases of clinical trials.

AB  - Covid 19 pandemic has placed challenges in front of medical health fraternity in terms of management, prevention and immunity building. Effectiveness of any  medication has not conclusively proven; hence there is need for integrative  management of Covid 19. We have managed a critical case of Covid-19 having  history of thalassemia, hypothyroidism with integrative management of Ayurveda  and modern medicine. A male patient (59 years of age) with history of thalassemia  had complaints of cough and breathlessness since 4 days. He performed RT PCR  because of his exposure to a Covid positive cases in immediate family. He was  treated with Favipiravir at home for 5 days. He deteriorated on 6th day with  SPO(2) dropped to 75%, temp raised to 101 F and respiratory rate (RR) raised to  45/min. He was admitted in Yogeshwari Hospital Daund, Maharashtra; treated with  oxygen inhalation, Remdesvir and Ayurveda medicines in intensive care unit (ICU).  Ayurveda treatment protocol was advised through telemedicine. Significant  improvement in clinical symptoms and normal HRCT was observed at completion of  treatment. This case report provides further directions for integrative  management in cases of Covid 19. Further clinical research studies in this  direction are warranted.

AB  - In our DFT investigations, pristine BNNS as well as trivalent and pentavalent atoms doped BNNS have been taken into consideration for Favipiravir (FPV) drug  carriers for the treatment of COVID-19. Among the nanosheets, In doped BNNS  (BN(In)NS) interacts with FPV by favorable adsorption energies about -2.44 and  -2.38 eV in gas and water media respectively. The charge transfer analysis also  predicted that a significant amount of charge about 0.202e and 0.27e are  transferred to BN(In)NS in gas and water media respectively. HOMO and LUMO  energies are greatly affected by the adsorption of FPV on BN(In)NS and energy gap  drastically reduced by about 38.80 % and 64.07 % in gas and water media  respectively. Similar results are found from the global indices and work function  analysis. Therefore, it is clearly seen that dopant In atom greatly modified the  BNNS and enhanced the adsorption behavior along with sensitivity, reactivity,  polarity towards the FPV.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) receiving ventilation or pulmonary support via veno-venous extracorporeal membrane  oxygenation (VV-ECMO) can be infected with drug-resistant bacteria. When  introducing VV-ECMO, the changes in serum antibiotic concentration should be  considered due to an increased volume of distribution (Vd). However, no  pharmacokinetic study has assessed teicoplanin (TEIC) treatment in patients with  COVID-19 receiving VV-ECMO. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old man diagnosed with  COVID-19 visited a primary hospital. His oxygenation conditions worsened despite  treatment with favipiravir and methylprednisolone as well as oxygen therapy.  After his transfer to our center, tracheal intubation and steroid pulse therapy  were initiated. Seven days after admission, VV-ECMO was performed. TEIC was  administered for secondary bacterial infection. The serum TEIC concentration  remained within the therapeutic range, indicating that VV-ECMO did not  significantly affect TEIC pharmacokinetics. VV-ECMO was discontinued 17 days  after admission. However, he developed multi-organ disorder and died 42 days  after admission. CONCLUSION: As TEIC prevents viral invasion, it may be used with  ECMO in patients with COVID-19 requiring ventilation; however, the altered  pharmacokinetics of TEIC, such as increased Vd, should be considered. Therefore,  TEIC pharmacokinetics in VV-ECMO should be assessed in future studies with an  appropriate number of patients.

AB  - Connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannels form a pathway for cellular communication between the cell and its extracellular environment. Under pathological conditions, Cx43  hemichannels release adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which triggers inflammation.  Over the past two years, azithromycin, chloroquine, dexamethasone, favipiravir,  hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, remdesivir, ribavirin, and ritonavir have been  proposed as drugs for the treatment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),  which is associated with prominent systemic inflammation. The current study aimed  to investigate if Cx43 hemichannels, being key players in inflammation, could be  affected by these drugs which were formerly designated as COVID-19 drugs. For  this purpose, Cx43-transduced cells were exposed to these drugs. The effects on  Cx43 hemichannel activity were assessed by measuring extracellular ATP release,  while the effects at the transcriptional and translational levels were monitored  by means of real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain  reaction analysis and immunoblot analysis, respectively. Exposure to lopinavir  and ritonavir combined (4:1 ratio), as well as to remdesivir, reduced Cx43 mRNA  levels. None of the tested drugs affected Cx43 protein expression.

AB  - (1) Background: The antiviral treatment for COVID-19 disease started to be largely used in 2020 and has been found to be efficient, although it is not  specific for SARS-CoV-2 virus. There were some concerns that it may produce liver  damage or other side effects. (2) Methods: The aim of this study was to observe  if antiviral therapy is affecting liver parameters or producing other  side-effects in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease. The study included a  group of patients hospitalized in the internal medicine department of Oradea  Municipal Clinical Hospital, Romania, between August 2020-June 2021, diagnosed  with SARS-CoV-2 viral infection by RT-PCR method or rapid antigen test. During  hospitalization, patients were treated with a Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra)  combination, or with Favipiravir or Remdesivir. In addition to monitoring the  evolution of the disease (clinical and biochemical), also hepatic parameters were  analyzed at admission, during hospitalization, and at discharge. (3) Results: In  the group of studied patients, the mean value of aspartat aminotrensferase did  not increase above normal at discharge, alanin aminotransferase increased, but  below twice the normal values, and cholestasis registered a statistically  insignificant slight increase. (4) Conclusions: In our study, we found that all  three antivirals were generally well tolerated and their use did not alter liver  function in a significant manner.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occasionally causes acute laryngitis, requiring emergency treatment. Understanding the characteristic laryngeal  findings can help diagnose COVID-19 earlier, prevent worsening infection, and  properly manage airway obstruction. Herein, we report the case of a 44-year-old  male with acute epiglottitis likely caused by COVID-19. On presentation, chest  computed tomography (CT) showed no signs of pneumonia. However, the larynx had  extensive necrotic-like erosive lesions resembling those of tuberculous  laryngitis. COVID-19 was diagnosed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain  reaction, and secondary bacterial superinfections were suspected after blood  testing. The symptoms improved after administration of antibiotics (sulbactam  sodium/ampicillin sodium), steroids (dexamethasone), and favipiravir. The patient  developed a high fever on the sixth day of hospitalization, and pneumonia was  identified on CT. Various culture tests, including tuberculosis, were negative.  Thus, remdesivir was administered for COVID-19-induced pneumonia. The patient  gradually recovered, was transferred to another hospital, and was discharged on  the 35th day of hospitalization. Six previous case reports of COVID-19-induced  acute epiglottitis suggested that acute epiglottitis preceded the onset of  pneumonia. The laryngeal findings from this report may be useful for diagnosing  COVID-19 that does not cause pneumonia and for bringing attention to pneumonia  after a COVID-19 diagnosis.

AB  - Electronic structure analysis of bimolecular formation of favipiravir (Fav) and a representative model of boron-nitrogen-carbon (BNC) cage was performed in this  work for providing more insightful information regarding the drug delivery  purposes by the importance of Fav drug for medication of COVID-19. To achieve the  purpose of this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried  out to obtain the stabilized structures and corresponding molecular and atomic  scale descriptors. Six models of BNC-Fav complexes were obtained reading the  participation of different atomic positions of Fav to interactions with the BNC  cage surface. The results yielded BNC-Fav2 at the highest strength and BNC-Fav4  at the lowest strength of bimolecular formations. Molecular orbital-related  features and atomic scale quadrupole coping constants all revealed that BNC-Fav2  complex could be proposed for employing in drug delivery process by managing the  loaded Fav contribution to future interactions.

AB  - Favipiravir displays a rapid viral clearance, a high recovery rate and broad therapeutic safety; however, its oral administration was associated with systemic  side effects in susceptible patients. Considering that the pulmonary route could  provide a high drug concentration, and a safer application with less absorption  into systemic circulation, it was aimed to elucidate whether favipiravir  delivered via soft-mist inhaler has any deleterious effects on lung, liver and  kidney tissues of healthy rats. Wistar albino rats of both sexes (n = 72) were  placed in restrainers, and were given either saline or favipiravir (1, 2.5, 5 or  10 mg/kg in 1 mL saline) by inhalation within 2 min for 5 consecutive days. On  the 6th day, electrocardiographic recording was obtained, and cardiac blood and  lung tissues were collected. Favipiravir did not alter cardiac rhythm, blood cell  counts, serum levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, blood urea  nitrogen, creatinine, urea or uric acid, and did not cause any significant  changes in the pulmonary malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase activity or antioxidant  glutathione levels. Our data revealed that pulmonary use of favipiravir via  soft-mist inhaler enables a high local concentration compared to plasma without  oxidative lung injury or cardiac or hepatorenal dysfunction.

AB  - On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The outbreak caused a worldwide impact, becoming a health threat to the  general population and its professionals. To date, there are no specific  antiviral treatments or vaccines for the COVID-19 infection, however, some drugs  are being clinically tested. The use of these drugs on large scale raises great  concern about their imminent environmental risk, since the elimination of these  compounds by feces and urine associated with the inefficiency of sewage treatment  plants in their removal can result in their persistence in the environment,  putting in risk the health of humans and of other species. Thus, the goal of this  work was to conduct a review of other studies that evaluated the presence of the  drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin, dexamethasone,  remdesivir, favipiravir and some HIV antivirals in the environment. The research  indicated the presence of these drugs in the environment in different regions,  with concentration data that could serve as a basis for further comparative  studies following the pandemic.

AB  - The structure and dynamics of membranes are crucial to ensure the proper functioning of cells. There are some compounds used in therapeutics that show  nonspecific interactions with membranes in addition to their specific molecular  target. Among them, two compounds recently used in therapeutics against COVID-19,  remdesivir and favipiravir, were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation  assays. In these, we demonstrated that the compounds can spontaneously bind to  model lipid membranes in the presence or absence of cholesterol. These findings  correlate with the corresponding experimental results recently reported by our  group. In conclusion, insertion of the compounds into the membrane is observed,  with a mean position close to the phospholipid head groups.

AB  - PURPOSE: As in vitro and in vivo studies reported antiviral efficacy against RNA viruses, favipiravir, a pyrazinecarboxamide derivative, has become one of the  treatment options for COVID-19 in some countries including Turkey. Preclinical  studies demonstrated the risk for teratogenicity and embryotoxicity. Hence, the  drug is contraindicated during pregnancy. Although limited in numbers, case-based  evaluations indicate that favipiravir might not be a major teratogen in human  pregnancies. This study aimed to present and analyze the outcomes of favipiravir  exposure during pregnancy. METHODS: In this case series, the outcomes of nine  pregnancies that were referred to the Teratology Information Service of Dokuz  Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Pharmacology between  01 April 2020 and 30 November 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: One  spontaneous abortion, two elective terminations, one preterm live delivery and  five term live deliveries were detected. The premature newborn was reported dead  on the 5th day of neonatal intensive care unit admission. Physiological jaundice  and transient respiratory distress were recorded in two term infants. One term  infant was antenatally diagnosed with renal pelviectasis, but the findings  resolved postnatally without requiring intervention. CONCLUSION: The data  indicate that favipiravir is not likely to be a major teratogen. Yet, it is not  possible to draw a definite conclusion due to methodological limitations.  Favipiravir exposures during pregnancy should be followed up closely and the  outcomes should be reported consistently.

AB  - There are limited data regarding the immunogenicity of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 among immunosuppressed or obese adolescents. We evaluated the  humoral immune response in adolescents with obesity and adolescent liver  transplant recipients (LTRs) after receiving two BNT162b2 doses. Sixty-eight  participants (44 males; mean age 14.9 ± 1.7 years), comprising 12 LTRs, 24 obese,  and 32 healthy adolescents, were enrolled. Immunogenicity was evaluated by  anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immunoassay and surrogate viral neutralization  tests (sVNT) against the Delta and Omicron (BA.1) variants. At 27.1 ± 3.2 days  after the second dose, the antibody levels were 1476.6 ± 1185.4, 2999.4 ± 1725.9,  and 4960.5 ± 2644.1 IU/mL in the LTRs, obese adolescents, and controls,  respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Among obese individuals, liver stiffness &lt;5.5 kPa  was associated with higher antibody levels. The %inhibition of sVNT was  significantly lower for the Omicron than that for the Delta variant. Injection  site pain was the most common local adverse event. Nine participants (three obese  and six controls) developed COVID-19 at 49 ± 11 days after the second  vaccination; four were treated with favipiravir. All infections were mild, and  the patients recovered without any consequences. Our study supports the need for  the booster regimen in groups with an inferior immunogenic response, including  LTRs and obese individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In late 2019, a highly infectious and pathogenic coronavirus was recognized as Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes  acute respiratory disease, threatening human health and public safety. A total of  448,327,303 documented cases and 6,028,576 deaths have been reported as of March  8th 2022. The COVID-19 vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials or already  in use should provide at least some protection against SARS-CoV-2; however, the  emergence of new variations as a result of mutations may lessen the effectiveness  of the currently available vaccines. Since the efficacy of available drugs and  vaccines against COVID-19 is notably lower, there is an urgent need to develop a  potential drug to treat this deadly disease. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (SCoV-SG) is  the foremost drug target among coronaviruses. ObjectiveL: The major objectives of  the current study are to conduct a molecular docking study investigation of  TAT-peptide47-57(GRKKRRQRRRP)-conjugated remodified therapeutics such as  ritonavir (RTV), lopinavir (LPV), favipiravir (FPV), remdesivir (RMV),  hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), molnupiravir (MNV) and nirmatrelvir (NMV) with  (SCoV-SG) structure. METHODS: Molecular docking analysis was performed to study  the interaction of repurposed drugs and drugs conjugated with the TAT-peptide  with target SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYB) using AutoDock. Further  docking investigation was completed with PatchDock and was visualized by  discovery the studio visualizer 2020. RESULTS: TAT-peptides are  well-characterized immune enhancers that are used in intracellular drug delivery.  The results of molecular docking analysis showed higher efficiency and  significantly enhanced and improved interactions between TP-conjugated repurposed  drugs and the target sites of the SCoV-SG structure. CONCLUSION: The study  concluded that TP-conjugated repurposed drugs may be effective in preventing  COVID-19, and therefore, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trial studies are  required in detail.

AB  - Influenza and COVID-19 are infectious respiratory diseases that represent a major concern to public health with social and economic impact worldwide, for which the  available therapeutic options are not satisfactory. The RdRp has a central role  in viral replication and thus represents a major target for the development of  antiviral approaches. In this study, we focused on Influenza A virus PB1  polymerase protein and the betacoronaviruses nsp12 polymerase protein,  considering their functional and structural similarities. We have performed  conservation and druggability analysis to map conserved druggable regions, that  may have functional or structural importance in these proteins. We disclosed the  most promising and new targeting regions for the discovery of new potential  polymerase inhibitors. Conserved druggable regions of putative interaction with  favipiravir and molnupiravir were also mapped. We have also compared and  integrated the current findings with previous research.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A majority of the fatalities due to COVID-19 have been observed in those over the age of 60. There is no approved and universally accepted treatment  for geriatric patients. The aim of this review is to assess the current  literature on efficacy of COVID-19 treatments in geriatric populations. METHODS:  A systematic review search was conducted in PubMed, MedRxiv, and JAMA databases  with the keywords COVID-19, geriatric, hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone,  budesonide, remdesivir, favipiravir, ritonavir, molnupiravir, tocilizumab,  bamlanivimab, baricitinib, sotrovimab, fluvoxamine, convalescent plasma, prone  position, or anticoagulation. Articles published from January 2019 to January  2022 with a population greater than or equal to 60 years of age were included.  Interventions examined included hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir,  dexamethasone, budesonide, tocilizumab, bamlanivimab, baricitinib, sotrovimab,  convalescent plasma, prone position, and anticoagulation therapy. Outcome  measures included viral load, viral markers, ventilator-free days, or clinical  improvement. RESULTS: The search revealed 302 articles, 52 met inclusion  criteria. Hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, and remdesivir revealed greater side  effects or inefficiency in geriatric patients with COVID-19. Favipiravir,  bamlanivimab, baricitinib, and supportive therapy showed a decrease in viral load  and improvement of clinical symptoms. There is conflicting evidence with  tocilizumab, convalescent plasma, and anticoagulant therapy in reducing  mortality, ventilator-free days, and clinical improvements. In addition, there  was limited evidence and lack of data due to ongoing trials for treatments with  sotrovimab and budesonide. CONCLUSION: No agent is known to be effective for  preventing COVID-19 after exposure to the virus. Further research is needed to  ensure safety and efficacy of each of the reviewed interventions for older  adults.

AB  - The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has till date (26/7/20) affected 1crore 62 lac 73 thousand 638 people globally with almost 6.5 lakh  mortalities. COVID-19 has invaded the operation theatre and intensive care unit  (ICU) in a short span of 6 months. It appears inevitable that all of us, as  anesthesiologists, have to treat COVID-positive patients, either in the ICU or  the operation theatre. Many asymptomatic, presumably noninfected people including  frontline health care workers are also consuming potential anticorona viral drugs  (such as hydroxychloroquine) prophylactically and may present for surgery.  Detailed knowledge of which anesthetic and perioperative care drugs can interact  with anti-COVID drugs would be very valuable for pre, intra-, and postoperative  management of such patients and COVID-19 positive patients requiring intubation,  mechanical ventilation, and ICU-sedation. Powered with this knowledge,  anesthesiologists and intensivists can minimize the adverse effects of drug  interactions. An extensive literature search using different search engines  including Cochrane, Embase, Google Scholar, Scopus, and PubMed for all indexed  review articles, original articles, case reports, and referenced webpages was  performed to extract the most current and relevant literature on drug-drug  interactions for clinicians.

AB  - Innovative therapeutic protocols to the rapidly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID19) epidemic is highly required all across the world. As demonstrated by  clinical studies, Favipiravir (FVP) and Remdesivir (REM) are new antiviral  medicines that are effective against COVID-19. REM is the first FDA approved  antiviral medicine against COVID-19. In addition to antivirals, corticosteroids  such as dexamethasone (DEX), and anticoagulants such as apixaban (PX) are used in  multidrug combinations protocols. This work develops and validates simple and  selective screening of the four medicines of COVID -19 therapeutic protocol. FVP,  REM, DEX, and PX as internal standard in human plasma using UPLC method by C18  column and methanol, acetonitrile, and water acidified by orthophosphate (pH = 4)  in a ratio of (15: 35: 50, by volume) as an eluate flowing at 0.3 mL/min. The  eluent was detected at 240 nm. The method was linear over (0.1-10 μg/mL) for each  of FVP, REM, and DEX. The validation of the UPLC method was assessed in  accordance with FDA guidelines. The method can detect as low as down to 0.1 μg/mL  for all. The recoveries of the drugs in spiked human plasma ranged from 97.67 to  102.98 percent. Method accuracy and precision were assessed and the drugs showed  good stability. The method was proven to be green to the environment after  greenness checking by greenness profile and Eco-Scale tool.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we assess population-level data of COVID-19 treatments in Iran compared to Ministry of Health (MOH)-published guidelines to gain a  better insight into the quality of care for this disease. METHODS: National sales  data of each recommended and nonrecommended COVID-19 medicine were used to proxy  utilization between March 21, 2020, and March 21, 2021, or Iranian year 1399.  COVID-19-attributed sales volume and number of patients were estimated by  adjusting sales data with pre-COVID-19 average growth rate, recommended dose, and  duration of treatment. Next, they were compared with the MOH guidelines in  outpatient and inpatient settings. Furthermore, the list of top 10 molecules of  the market and top 10 COVID-19-indicated molecules in terms of values were  extracted to assess the economic burden of COVID-19 prescription drugs and their  share. FINDINGS: The estimated number of patients receiving COVID-19 treatments  in some outpatient medicines such as recommended hydroxychloroquine was over 2.2  million. Favipiravir and remdesivir were collectively about two inpatient  medicines 260,000; however, neither of these two medicines was recommended in the  MOH guidelines. In some fewer specific medicines such as dexamethasone,  prednisolone, azithromycin, and naproxen, the estimated number of  COVID-19-attributed patients were incomparable with the officially announced  number of confirmed cases in the year of study, which could be related to  nonconfirmed diagnosed cases, irrational use, or prescribing, or limitations of  our data and study. The total COVID-19-attributed market of candidate medicines  was over 15 trillion IR Rials (almost 4.3% of the total market). Remdesivir, with  over 60% of the total COVID-19 attributed market, followed by favipiravir, was  among the highest value medicines. CONCLUSION: Despite the release of the  COVID-19 guideline by Iran MOH, misalignment in the enforcement of decisions was  a serious weakness (cases of favipiravir and remdesivir). This weakness led to  some economic burden on the health-care system and raised ethical concerns.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the pragmatism of published randomized trials of remdesivir and favipiravir based on the Pragmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary  (PRECIS-2) framework. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Ten eligible trials were  identified from an existing comprehensive living review and were evaluated across  the nine PRECIS-2 domains by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: All 10 trials  had mostly pragmatic design characteristics. Four of the domains (i.e.,  recruitment, setting, organization, and primary analysis) were found to be  pragmatic with most trials scoring four or five across the two interventions. In  comparison scores for four other design domains (i.e., eligibility, follow-up,  flexibility of delivery, and primary outcome) varied across the trials with some  design choices being more explanatory. CONCLUSION: In our descriptive review of  randomized controlled trails for two drugs for patients infected with COVID-19  early in the pandemic, we found that most trials had more pragmatic than  explanatory characteristics. Some design choices for some of the trials, however,  were not consistent with the urgent goal of informing clinical decision making in  an epidemic. PRECIS-2 should be used as a guide by trialists, to help them match  their trial design choices to the intended purpose of their trial.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, several repurposed drugs have been proposed to alleviate the major health effects of the disease. These drugs are often applied  with analgesics or non-steroid anti-inflammatory compounds, and co-morbid  patients may also be treated with anticancer, cholesterol-lowering, or  antidiabetic agents. Since drug ADME-tox properties may be significantly affected  by multispecific transporters, in this study, we examined the interactions of the  repurposed drugs with the key human multidrug transporters present in the major  tissue barriers and strongly affecting the pharmacokinetics. Our in vitro  studies, using a variety of model systems, explored the interactions of the  antimalarial agents chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; the antihelmintic  ivermectin; and the proposed antiviral compounds ritonavir, lopinavir,  favipiravir, and remdesivir with the ABCB1/Pgp, ABCG2/BCRP, and ABCC1/MRP1  exporters, as well as the organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)2B1 and  OATP1A2 uptake transporters. The results presented here show numerous  pharmacologically relevant transporter interactions and may provide a warning on  the potential toxicities of these repurposed drugs, especially in drug  combinations at the clinic.

AU  - Shannon, Ashleigh

T2  - Antiviral research
AB  - Nucleoside/tide analogues (NAs) have long been used in the fight against viral diseases, and now present a promising option for the treatment of COVID-19. Once  activated to the 5'-triphosphate state, NAs act by targeting the viral  RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase for incorporation into the viral RNA genome.  Incorporated analogues can either 'kill' (terminate) synthesis, or 'corrupt'  (genetically or chemically) the RNA. Against coronaviruses, the use of NAs has  been further complicated by the presence of a virally encoded exonuclease domain  (nsp14) with proofreading and repair capacities. Here, we describe the mechanism  of action of four promising anti-COVID-19 NAs; remdesivir, molnupiravir,  favipiravir and bemnifosbuvir. Their distinct mechanisms of action best exemplify  the concept of 'killers' and 'corruptors'. We review available data regarding  their ability to be incorporated and excised, and discuss the specific structural  features that dictate their overall potency, toxicity, and mutagenic potential.  This should guide the synthesis of novel analogues, lend insight into the  potential for resistance mutations, and provide a rational basis for upcoming  combinations therapies.

AB  - Background: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the only zoonotic-origin CoV to reach the pandemic stage, to  which neither an effective vaccine nor a specific therapy is available. The spike  glycoprotein harbors the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that mediates the virus's  entry to host cells. This study aimed to identify novel inhibitors that target  the spike protein's RBD domain through computational screening of chemical and  natural compounds. Method: The spike protein was modeled from the recently  reported electron microscopy protein structure (PDB ID: 6VSB) and the previously  described SARS-CoV protein structure (PDB ID: 6ACD and 6ACJ). Virtual lab bench  CLC Drug Discovery was used to computationally screen for potential inhibitory  effects of currently prescribed drugs (n = 22), natural antiviral drugs  (n = 100), and natural compounds (n = 35032). Quantitative Structure-Activity  Relationship (QSAR) studies were also performed to determine the leading binders  known for their antiviral activity. Results: Among the drugs currently used to  treat SARS-CoV2, hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir were identified as the best  binders with an average of four H-bonds, with a binding affinity of - 36.66  kcal/mol and a minimum interaction energy of - 6.63 kcal/mol. In an evaluation of  antiviral compounds, fosamprenavir and abacavir showed effective binding of five  H-bonds, with an average binding affinity of - 18.75 kcal.mol(- 1) and minimum  interaction energy of - 3.57 kcal/mol. Furthermore, screening of 100 natural  antiviral compounds predicted potential binding modes of glycyrrhizin, nepritin,  punicalagin, epigallocatechin gallate, and theaflavin (average binding affinity  of - 49.88 kcal/mol and minimum interaction energy of - 4.35 kcal/mol).  Additionally, the study reports a list of 25 natural compounds that showed  effective binding with an improved average binding affinity of - 51.46 kcal/mol.  Conclusions: Using computational screening, we identified potential SARS-CoV-2 S  glycoprotein inhibitors that bind to the RBD region. Using structure-based design  and combination-based drug therapy, the identified molecules could be used to  generate anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates.

AB  - To date, the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide include viral infections, such as Ebola, influenza virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and recently COVID-19 disease,  caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently, we can count on a narrow range of  antiviral drugs, especially older generation ones like ribavirin and interferon  which are effective against viruses in vitro but can often be ineffective in  patients. In addition to these, we have antiviral agents for the treatment of  herpes virus, influenza virus, HIV and hepatitis virus. Recently, drugs used in  the past especially against ebolavirus, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, have  been considered for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. However, even if these  drugs represent important tools against viral diseases, they are certainly not  sufficient to defend us from the multitude of viruses present in the environment.  This represents a huge problem, especially considering the unprecedented global  threat due to the advancement of COVID-19, which represents a potential risk to  the health and life of millions of people. The demand, therefore, for new and  effective antiviral drugs is very high. This review focuses on three fundamental  points: (1) presents the main threats to human health, reviewing the most  widespread viral diseases in the world, thus describing the scenario caused by  the disease in question each time and evaluating the specific therapeutic  remedies currently available. (2) It comprehensively describes main phytochemical  classes, in particular from plant foods, with proven antiviral activities, the  viruses potentially treated with the described phytochemicals. (3) Consideration  of the various applications of drug delivery systems in order to improve the  bioavailability of these compounds or extracts. A PRISMA flow diagram was used  for the inclusion of the works. Taking into consideration the recent dramatic  events caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the cry of alarm that denounces critical need  for new antiviral drugs is extremely strong. For these reasons, a continuous  systematic exploration of plant foods and their phytochemicals is necessary for  the development of new antiviral agents capable of saving lives and improving  their well-being.

AB  - The novel human coronavirus was firstly emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread rapidly around the world. There is no known specific effective  treatment of COVID-19. The most commonly used agents against this disease both in  Turkey and around the world include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine,  lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, and remdesivir. In the study, we investigated  the drug potential of molecules that the components of an important medicinal  plant Hypericum perforatum by using molecular docking and drug possibility  properties of these molecules. The molecular docking results showed that the most  stable complex was obtained with COVID-19 main protease and  hypericin/isohypericin ligands with - 11 kcal/mol binding energy. Furthermore,  ADMET, drug-likeness features of compounds of H. perforatum were investigated  using the rules of Lipinski, Veber, and Ghose. According to the results obtained,  it has been shown that H. perforatum has the potential to be an effective drug in  the COVID-19 pandemic. In the next stage, it is necessary to carry out the  clinically necessary reliability studies of these components. It is thought that  it can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 if our molecular docking results are  found to be in high correlation with clinical studies.

AB  - The object of the analytical work is to develop an analytical multivariate optimization for the determination of Favipiravir (FAV), a SARS-CoV-2 molecule,  by the reverse-phase liquid chromatographic method using the analytical quality  by design approach. FAV is used as an antiviral drug. Box-Behnken design is  utilized for the optimization of the experiment and to identify the critical  method parameters like the volume of acetonitrile, temperature and flow rate.  Further, these factors are used to design the suitable mathematical models and  illustrate their effect on various responses. This newly developed method  utilized C18 column (5μm, 100 × 4.6 mm) and a temperature of 40°C with a flow  rate of 0.5 mL/min. The mobile phase is composed of acetonitrile and ammonium  acetate buffer (pH 4), in the ratio of 20:80v/v and the wavelength of HPLC  UV-Detector was fixed to 323nm. This method is validated according to  International Council for Harmonization Q2 (R1) guidelines. The System  suitability is performed and the retention time of Favipiravir is 3.4min. The  linearity range is obtained at 0.062 - 4 μg/mL with a correlation coefficient (r2  = 0.9979). The recovery is found to be in the range of 98.84-100%. Thus, the  intended method is found to be simple and robust.

AB  - Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), novel corona virus has caused pandemic globally, with rise in the number of cases and death of the patients.  Vast majority of the countries that are dealing with rise in the active cases and  death of patients suffering from novel corona viruses COVID-19 are trying to  content the virus by isolating the patients and treating them with the approved  antiviral that have been previously used in treating SARS, MERS, and drugs that  are used to treat other viral infections. Some of these are under clinical  trials. At present there are no therapeutically effective antiviral present and  there are no vaccines or drugs available that are clinically approved for  treating the corona virus. The current strategy is to re-purpose the available  drugs or antiviral that can minimise or reduce the burden of the health care  emergencies. In this article the reuse of antiviral, US-FDA approved drugs, plant  based therapeutic, anti-malarial, anti-parasitic, anti-HIV drugs and the  traditional medicines that are being currently used in treating the symptoms of  COVID-19 patients is discussed emphasis is also given on the treatment using  monoclonal antibodies. The present article provides the therapeutic strategies  that will qualify as one of the best available treatment for the better  management of the COVID-19 patients in order to achieve medical benefits.

AB  - A recent study reported that patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) are at increased risk of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there  are no studies on the outcome of COVID-19 patients with preexisting ILD treated  with corticosteroids or antiviral drugs. We extracted 26 patients with  preexisting ILD by medical records and HRCT pattern. Of 503 patients with  COVID-19, we selected 52 patients as control matched for age and sex. Twenty out  of the 26 ILD patients (76.9%) received corticosteroid therapy, and 23 patients  (88.5%) also received antiviral treatment with remdesivir or favipiravir.  Although no statistical difference was found, the proportion of severe patients  in ILD group tended to be higher than in non-ILD group (23.1% vs. 42.3%;  p = 0.114). Also, mortality rate in ILD group tended to be higher than in non-ILD  patients (11.5% vs. 3.8%; p = 0.326). In univariate analysis to evaluate risk  factors for severe condition, diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, usual  interstitial pneumonia pattern, and honeycomb lung were not risk factors of  severe disease. Treatment with corticosteroids, antiviral drugs, and  immunosuppressive agents may affect the outcome of COVID-19 patients with ILD.

AB  - Nucleoside and nucleotide analogs are an essential class of antivirals for COVID-19 treatment. Several nucleoside/nucleotide analogs have shown promising  effects against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro; however, their in vivo efficacy is limited.  Nucleoside/nucleotide analogs are often formed as ester prodrugs to improve  pharmacokinetics (PK) performance. After entering cells, the prodrugs undergo  several enzymatic metabolism steps to form the active metabolite triphosphate  nucleoside (TP-Nuc); prodrug activation is therefore associated with the  abundance and catalytic activity of the corresponding activating enzymes. Having  the activation of nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs occur at the target site of  action, such as the lung, is critical for anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Herein, we  conducted an absolute quantitative proteomics study to determine the expression  of relevant activating enzymes in human organs related to the PK and antiviral  efficacy of nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs, including the lung, liver, intestine,  and kidney. The protein levels of prodrug-activating enzymes differed  significantly among the tissues. Using catalytic activity values reported  previously for individual enzymes, we calculated prodrug activation profiles in  these tissues. The prodrugs evaluated in this study include nine McGuigan  phosphoramidate prodrugs, two cyclic monophosphate prodrugs, two l-valyl ester  prodrugs, and one octanoate prodrug. Our analysis showed that most orally  administered nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs were primarily activated in the  liver, suggesting that parenteral delivery routes such as inhalation and  intravenous infusion could be better options when these antiviral prodrugs are  used to treat COVID-19. The results also indicated that the l-valyl ester prodrug  design can plausibly improve drug bioavailability and enhance effects against  SARS-CoV-2 intestinal infections. This study further revealed that an octanoate  prodrug could provide a long-acting antiviral effect targeting SARS-CoV-2  infections in the lung. Finally, our molecular docking analysis suggested several  prodrug forms of favipiravir and GS-441524 that are likely to exhibit favorable  PK features over existing prodrug forms. In sum, this study revealed the  activation mechanisms of various nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs relevant to  COVID-19 treatment in different organs and shed light on the development of more  effective anti-COVID-19 prodrugs.

AB  - COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease caused by a newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus and identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. WHO  has declared this disease as a pandemic, and warned other countries. Presently  this has affected 216 countries, areas or territories worldwide, spreading of  this disease is very fast in USA, Brazil, and Russia than in the country of its  origin, China. Like other coronaviruses, this may develop respiratory tract  infections in the patients range from mild to fatal illness like pneumonia and  acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As of now, no effective drug,  vaccine, or any procedure is available and experiments are underway. However,  empirical therapy is being followed to manage and save the lives of the patients.  There is a need for pharmacological alternatives to combat this deadly virus and  its complications. Based on the previous experiences with similar coronavirus  management and present preliminary data from uncontrolled studies, drugs like  chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir  have been recommended by the researchers to manage COVID-19. This review had  assessed the potential mechanisms, safety profile, availability and cost of these  drugs. This review concludes that the drugs mentioned above are having different  properties and act differently in combating the COVID-19 viruses. Instead of  single drug, combination of antivirals with different mechanism of action may be  more effective and at the same time their adverse events should not be  underestimated.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although several repurposed antiviral drugs have been used for the treatment of COVID-19, only a few such as remdesivir and  molnupiravir have shown promising effects. The objectives of our study were to  investigate the association of repurposed antiviral drugs with COVID-19  morbidity. METHODS: Patients admitted to 26 different hospitals located in 16  different provinces between March 11-July 18, 2020, were enrolled. Case  definition was based on WHO criteria. Patients were managed according to the  guidelines by Scientific Board of Ministry of Health of Turkey. Primary outcomes  were length of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) requirement, and  intubation. RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated 1,472 COVID-19 adult patients;  57.1% were men (mean age = 51.9 ± 17.7years). A total of 210 (14.3%) had severe  pneumonia, 115 (7.8%) were admitted to ICUs, and 69 (4.7%) were intubated during  hospitalization. The median (interquartile range) of duration of hospitalization,  including ICU admission, was 7 (5-12) days. Favipiravir (n = 328),  lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 55), and oseltamivir (n = 761) were administered as  antiviral agents, and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, n = 1,382) and azithromycin (n =  738) were used for their immunomodulatory activity. Lopinavir/ritonavir (β [95%  CI]: 4.71 [2.31-7.11]; p = 0.001), favipiravir (β [95% CI]: 3.55 [2.56-4.55]; p =  0.001) and HCQ (β [95% CI]: 0.84 [0.02-1.67]; p = 0.046) were associated with  increased risk of lengthy hospital stays. Furthermore, favipiravir was associated  with increased risks of ICU admission (OR [95% CI]: 3.02 [1.70-5.35]; p = 0.001)  and invasive mechanical ventilation requirement (OR [95% CI]: 2.94 [1.28-6.75]; p  = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that antiviral drugs including  lopinavir, ritonavir, and favipiravir were associated with negative clinical  outcomes such as increased risks for lengthy hospital stay, ICU admission, and  invasive mechanical ventilation requirement. Therefore, repurposing such agents  without proven clinical evidence might not be the best approach for COVID-19  treatment.

AB  - Vaccines are used as one of the major weapons for the eradication of pandemic. However, the rise of different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is creating  doubts regarding the end of the pandemic. Hence, there is an urgent need to  develop more drug candidates which can be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.  In the present research for the scientific hypothesis, emphasis was given on the  direct antiviral therapy available for the treatment of COVID-19. In lieu of  this, the available molecular targets which include Severe Acute Respiratory  Syndrome Chymotrypsin-like Protease (SARS-3CLpro), Papain-Like Cysteine Protease  (PLpro), and RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) were explored. As per the  current scientific reports and literature, among all the available molecular  targets, RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) was found to be a crucial molecular  target for the treatment of COVID-19. Most of the inhibitors which are reported  against this target consisted of the free amine group and carbonyl group which  might be playing an important role in the binding interaction with the RdRp  protein. Among all the reported RdRp inhibitors, remdesivir, favipiravir, and  molnupiravir were found to be the most promising drugs against COVID-19. Overall,  the structural features of this RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors  proved the importance of pyrrolo-triazine and pyrimidine scaffolds. Previous  computational models of these drug molecules indicated that substitution with the  polar functional group, hydrogen bond donor, and electronegative atoms on these  scaffolds may increase the activity against the RdRp protein. Hence, in line with  the proposed hypothesis, in the present research work for the evaluation of the  hypothesis, new molecules were designed from the pyrrolo-triazine and pyrimidine  scaffolds. Further, molecular docking and MD simulation studies were performed  with these designed molecules. All these designed molecules (DM-1, DM-2, and  DM-3) showed the results as per the proposed hypothesis. Among all the designed  molecules, DM-1 showed promising results against the RdRp protein of SARS-CoV-2.  In the future, these structural features can be used for the development of new  RdRp inhibitors with improved activity. Also, in the future lead compound DM-1  can be explored against the RdRp protein for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Although many efforts have been made to elucidate the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully uncovered. However, it is known  that a dysfunctional immune response and the accompanying uncontrollable  inflammation lead to troublesome outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Pannexin1  channels are put forward as interesting drug targets for the treatment of  COVID-19 due to their key role in inflammation and their link to other viral  infections. In the present study, we selected a panel of drugs previously tested  in clinical trials as potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 early on  in the pandemic, including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin,  dexamethasone, ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, and ritonavir. The  effect of the drugs on pannexin1 channels was assessed at a functional level by  means of measurement of extracellular ATP release. Immunoblot analysis and  real-time quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction analysis  were used to study the potential of the drugs to alter pannexin1 protein and mRNA  expression levels, respectively. Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and  the combination of lopinavir with ritonavir were found to inhibit pannexin1  channel activity without affecting pannexin1 protein or mRNA levels. Thusthree  new inhibitors of pannexin1 channels were identified that, though currently not  being used anymore for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, could be potential  drug candidates for other pannexin1-related diseases.

AB  - A new global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in high mortality and morbidity. Currently numerous drugs are under expedited  investigations without well-established safety or efficacy data. Pharmacogenomics  may allow individualization of these drugs thereby improving efficacy and safety.  In this review, we summarized the pharmacogenomic literature available for  COVID-19 drug therapies including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin,  remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat,  interferon beta-1b, tocilizumab, ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and corticosteroids.  We searched PubMed, reviewed the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB(®))  website, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines,  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pharmacogenomics information in the  product labeling, and the FDA pharmacogenomics association table. We found  several drug-gene variant pairs that may alter the pharmacokinetics of  hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, SLCO1A2, and SLCO1B1);  azithromycin (ABCB1); ribavirin (SLC29A1, SLC28A2, and SLC28A3); and  lopinavir/ritonavir (SLCO1B1, ABCC2, CYP3A). We also identified other variants,  that are associated with adverse effects, most notable in  hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (G6PD; hemolysis), ribavirin (ITPA; hemolysis),  and interferon β -1b (IRF6; liver toxicity). We also describe the complexity of  the risk for QT prolongation in this setting because of additive effects of  combining more than one QT-prolonging drug (i.e., hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine  and azithromycin), increased concentrations of the drugs due to genetic variants,  along with the risk of also combining therapy with potent inhibitors. In  conclusion, although direct evidence in COVID-19 patients is lacking, we  identified potential actionable genetic markers in COVID-19 therapies. Clinical  studies in COVID-19 patients are deemed warranted to assess potential roles of  these markers.

AB  - Quercetin is a phenolic flavonol compound with established antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immuno-stimulant properties. Recent studies demonstrate  the potential of quercetin against COVID-19. This article highlighted the  prophylactic/therapeutic potential of quercetin against COVID-19 in view of its  clinical studies, inventions, and patents. The literature for the subject matter  was collected utilizing different databases, including PubMed, Sci-Finder,  Espacenet, Patentscope, and USPTO. Clinical studies expose the potential of  quercetin monotherapy, and also its combination therapy with other compounds,  including zinc, vitamin C, curcumin, vitamin D3, masitinib, hydroxychloroquine,  azithromycin, and ivermectin. The patent literature also examines claims that  quercetin containing nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements,  alone or in combination with other drugs/compounds, including favipiravir,  remdesivir, molnupiravir, navitoclax, dasatinib, disulfiram, rucaparib,  tamarixin, iota-carrageenan, and various herbal extracts (aloe, poria, rosemary,  and sphagnum) has potential for use against COVID-19. The literature reveals that  quercetin exhibits anti-COVID-19 activity because of its inhibitory effect on the  expression of the human ACE2 receptors and the enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 (MPro,  PLPro, and RdRp). The USFDA designated quercetin as a "Generally Recognized as  Safe" substance for use in the food and beverage industries. It is also an  inexpensive and readily available compound. These facts increase the possibility  and foreseeability of making novel and economical drug combinations containing  quercetin to prevent/treat COVID-19. Quercetin is an acidic compound and shows  metabolic interaction with some antivirals, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory  agents. Therefore, the physicochemical and metabolic drug interactions between  quercetin and the combined drugs/compounds must be better understood before  developing new compositions.

AB  - The aim of the current study is to investigate the efficacy of the electro-Fenton process in the degradation of favipiravir drugs from aqueous solutions, which has  increased in use as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Response Surface  Methodology (RSM) was developed using a Central Composite Design (CCD) in which  five independent variables, including Fe(2+) concentration, current density,  initial FVP concentration, pH, and reaction time, were coded with high and low  levels, and the maximum removal percentage of FVP (97.8%) and COD (91.65%) were  determined as responses. In the EF process, 530 mg/L H(2)O(2) was produced  in-situ by cathodic reduction of O(2) in aqueous solution and thus FVP has been  successfully oxidized through hydroxyl radicals. The H(2)O(2)/Fe(2+) ratio was  determined to be 0.51 under optimum conditions. At the end of the experiment, the  maximum energy consumption was found to be 2.12 kWh per g COD. The FVP was  completely mineralized in a very short time by the EF process, according to the  LC-MS/MS examination. The EF process followed the pseudo first-order kinetic  model with the rate constants of 0.023, 0.016 and 0.006 1/min for pH 2, 3 and 4,  respectively. According to the findings of this study, the electro-Fenton process  is an effective method for removing FVP from aqueous solutions. To the authors'  knowledge, this is the first study to show the degradation and optimum conditions  of FVP in aqueous solution using the electro-Fenton (EF) process.

AB  - Favipiravir is a prodrug of T-1105 made by modifying the pyrazine group as a COVID-19 therapy. During the pandemic, a safe and comfortable biosampling  technique is needed for the subject or patient. Volumetric Absorptive  Microsampling (VAMS) is a biosampling technique with a small blood volume and  minimum hematocrit effect. The aims of this study were to develop and validate an  analytical method for quantifying favipiravir extracted from VAMS using High  Performance Liquid Chromatography - Photodiode Array with remdesivir as an  internal standard. Analysis of favipiravir was performed using a C(18) column  (Waters, Sunfire™ 5 µm; 250 × 4.6 mm), with injection volume of 50 µL, flow rate  of 0.8 mL/min, column temperature 30 ℃, and wavelength 300 nm. The separation was  conducted under gradient elution with mobile phase consists of acetonitrile-0.2 %  formic acid-20 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate pH 3.5 and run time 12 min. Sample  preparation was carried out using a protein precipitation method with 500 µL of  methanol as precipitating agent. Samples were mixed on vortex for 30 s, sonicated  for 15 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Lower Limit of  Quantification (LLOQ) obtained was 0.5 µg/mL and the calibration curve ranged  from 0.5 to 160 µg/mL. Sensitivity, linearity, selectivity, carry-over, accuracy,  precision, recovery, and stability were validated by the guideline from Food and  Drug Administration 2018. The method developed has successfully met the full  validation requirements by FDA 2018 with the LLOQ obtained was 0.5 µg /mL.

AB  - Any highly infectious and rapidly spreading disease is a primary concern for immunocompromised solid organ transplant recipients. The number of data about the  spectrum of clinical illness, the treatment modalities, and the outcomes of  COVID-19 in this vulnerable population is scant and still remains empirical.  Herein, we report the first COVID-19 case of a heart transplant recipient in  Turkey who presented with fever, postnasal discharge, and myalgias for two days.  The possibility of lung involvement was ruled out by thoracic computed  tomography. Despite stable vital signs, we reduced the intensity of  immunosuppressive therapy and maintained home self-isolation promptly. We also  commenced a five-day course of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg q12h initially. After  confirmation of real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerasechain- reaction testing  of the nasopharyngeal swab positive for COVID-19, the patient was hospitalized.  After a loading dose of favipiravir 1,600 mg b.i.d., the patient received a  five-day course of favipiravir 600 mg q12h. He was discharged with cure after 23  days of hospital isolation and treatment. In conclusion, treatment process can be  affected by the daily electrocardiography, hand-held portable echocardiography,  myocardial injury markers, and pulse oximeter for selfmonitoring in the follow-up  of previous heart transplant recipients suffering from COVID-19. The lack of  treatment protocols in the solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19  infection and the controversies about the protective effect of immunosuppression  invite a global and update discussion.

AB  - AIMS: To perform network meta-analysis for a head-to-head comparison of various interventions used in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on mortality, clinical  recovery, time to clinical improvement and the occurrence of serious adverse  events. METHODS: Systematic search was performed using online databases with  suitable MeSH terms including coronavirus, COVID-19, randomized controlled trial,  hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, remdesivir, favipiravir,  dexamethasone and interferon-β. Data were independently extracted by 2 study  investigators and analysed. RESULTS: Out of 1225 studies screened, 23 were  included for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Among the drugs studied,  dexamethasone reduces mortality by 10%, with a relative risk of 0.90 (95%  confidence interval [0.82-0.97]) and increases clinical recovery by 6% (relative  risk 1.06, 95% confidence interval [1.02-1.10]) compared to standard of care.  Similarly, remdesivir administered for 10 days increased clinical recovery by  10%, reduced time to clinical improvement by 4 days and lowered the occurrence of  serious adverse events by 27% as compared to standard of care. CONCLUSION: In  comparison to standard of care, dexamethasone was found to increase clinical  recovery and lower mortality; remdesivir was significantly associated with a  lower risk of mortality as compared to tocilizumab and higher clinical recovery  and shorter time to clinical improvement as compared to hydroxychloroquine and  tocilizumab; remdesivir followed by tocilizumab were found to have lesser  occurrence of serious adverse events in patients with moderate to severe  COVID-19.

AB  - Formulating pharmaceutical cocrystals as inhalable dosage forms represents a unique niche in effective management of respiratory infections. Favipiravir, a  broad-spectrum antiviral drug with potential pharmacological activity against  SARS-CoV-2, exhibits a low aqueous solubility. An ultra-high oral dose is  essential, causing low patient compliance. This study reports a Quality-by-Design  (QbD)-guided development of a carrier-free inhalable dry powder formulation  containing a 1:1 favipiravir-theophylline (FAV-THP) cocrystal via spray drying,  which may provide an alternative treatment strategy for individuals with  concomitant influenza infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease/asthma. The cocrystal formation was confirmed by single crystal X-ray  diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, and the construction of a  temperature-composition phase diagram. A three-factor, two-level, full factorial  design was employed to produce the optimized formulation and study the impact of  critical processing parameters on the resulting median mass aerodynamic diameter  (MMAD), fine particle fraction (FPF), and crystallinity of the spray-dried  FAV-THP cocrystal. In general, a lower solute concentration and feed pump rate  resulted in a smaller MMAD with a higher FPF. The optimized formulation (F1)  demonstrated an MMAD of 2.93 μm and an FPF of 79.3%, suitable for deep lung  delivery with no in vitro cytotoxicity observed in A549 cells.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Some SARS-CoV-2 patients have liver function abnormalities due to anti-viral drug effects. METHODS: The design of this study was a case series  reported using retrospectives. Data collection was carried out from December 2020  to February 2021. All participants were diagnosed with SAR-CoV-2 and received an  anti-viral drug which identified liver function abnormalities. RESULTS: The  patients' average age was 54.56 ± 14.46 years old. Most patients experienced  shortness of breath and cough, with hypertension as the accompanying comorbid.  Increased AST and ALT were found in one patient who used Lopinavir-Ritonavir. The  increase was 1.0 times to 2.0 times the expected value. Increased CRP, D-dimer  and procalcitonin were also found, with a mean of 12.27 ± 15,34,  1861.29 ± 1828.85 and 1.54 ± 2.84, respectively. One of the patients in the  Lopinavir-Ritonavir group died while receiving treatment. CONCLUSION: SAR-CoV-2  is one of the risk factors that cause liver function abnormalities supported by  anti-viral drugs that cause liver work to increase.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are emerging zoonotic diseases  caused by coronavirus (CoV) infections. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  (RdRp) has been suggested as a valuable target for antiviral therapeutics because  the sequence homology of CoV RdRp is highly conserved. We established a  cell-based reporter assay for MERS-CoV RdRp activity to test viral polymerase  inhibitors. The cell-based reporter system was composed of the bicistronic  reporter construct and the MERS-CoV nsp12 plasmid construct. Among the tested  nine viral polymerase inhibitors, ribavirin, sofosbuvir, favipiravir, lamivudine,  zidovudine, valacyclovir, vidarabine, dasabuvir, and remdesivir, only remdesivir  exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition. Meanwhile, the Z-factor and Z'-factor of  this assay for screening inhibitors of MERS-CoV RdRp activity were 0.778 and  0.782, respectively. Ribavirin and favipiravir did not inhibit the MERS-CoV RdRp  activity, and non-nucleoside HCV RdRp inhibitor, dasabuvir, partially inhibited  MERS-CoV RdRp activity. Taken together, the cell-based reporter assay for  MERS-CoV RdRp activity confirmed remdesivir as a direct inhibitor of MERS-CoV  RdRp in cells. A cell-based MERS-CoV RdRp activity reporter assay is reliable and  accurate for screening MERS-CoV RdRp-specific inhibitors. It may provide a  valuable platform for developing antiviral drugs for emerging CoV infections.

AB  - The outbreak of novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 36 million people and caused approximately 1 million deaths around the globe as of 9 October  2020. The escalating outspread of the virus and rapid rise in the number of cases  require the instantaneous development of effectual drugs and vaccines. Presently,  there are no approved drugs or vaccine available to treat the infection. In such  scenario, one of the propitious therapeutic approaches against viral infection is  to explore enzyme inhibitors amidst natural compounds, utilizing computational  approaches aiming to get products with negligible side effects. In the present  study, the inhibitory prospects of ilimaquinone (marine sponge metabolite) were  assessed in comparison with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, favipiravir,  ivermectin and remdesivir at the active binding pockets of nine different vital  SARS-CoV-2 target proteins (spike receptor binding domain, RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase, Nsp10, Nsp13, Nsp14, Nsp15, Nsp16, main protease, and  papain-like-protease), employing an in silico molecular interaction based  approach. In addition, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the SARS-CoV-2  papain-like protease (PLpro)-ilimaquinone complex were also carried out to  calculate various structural parameters including root mean square fluctuation  (RMSF), root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (R (g)) and  hydrogen bond interactions. PLpro is a promising drug target, due to its  imperative role in viral replication and additional function of stripping  ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from host-cell proteins. In  light of the possible inhibition of all vital SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, our  study has emphasized the importance to study in depth ilimaquinone actions in  vivo.

AB  - The clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19 disease is mainly due to a dysregulated host response related to the overexpression of inflammatory markers.  Until recently, only remdesivir had gained FDA approval for COVID-19 hospitalized  patients and there are currently no evidence-based therapeutic options or options  for prevention of complications that have been established. Some medical  treatments such as antivirals, antibacterials, antithrombotics, antipyretics,  corticosteroids, interleukin inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, convalescent  plasma, immunostimulants, and vitamin supplements have been utilized. However,  there are limited data to support their effectiveness. Hence, this study was  attempted to identify and evaluate the effectiveness of antibacterials and  antivirals used for COVID-19 using a retrospective cross-sectional approach based  on the medical records of adult patients in four hospitals. The number of  antibacterials was calculated in defined daily dose (DDD) per 100 bed-days unit.  Both mixed-logit regression and analysis of covariance were used to determine the  effectiveness of the aforementioned agents in relation to COVID-19 outcome and  patients' length of stay. The model was weighed accordingly and covariates (e.g.,  age) were considered in the model. Heart disease was found to be the most common  pre-existing condition of COVID-19 hospitalized patients in this study.  Azithromycin, an antibacterial in the Watch category list, was used extensively  (33-65 DDD per 100 bed-days). Oseltamivir, an antiviral approved by the FDA for  influenza was the most prescribed antiviral. In addition, favipiravir was found  to be a significant factor in improving patients' COVID-19 outcomes and  decreasing their length of stay. This study strongly suggests that COVID-19  patients' received polypharmacy for their treatment. However, most of the drugs  used did not reach statistical significance in improving the patients' condition  or decreasing the length of stay. Further studies to support drug use are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although several studies have assessed the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of interventions in treating the COVID-19, many of them have  limitations that can have an immense impact on their results. This study aims to  assess the potential limitations in systematic reviews (SRs) that evaluate the  effect of interventions on the treatment of the COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed,  Scopus, and Web of Sciences (WOS) databases were searched from inception to  January 1, 2022. All systematic reviews investigated the effectiveness, efficacy,  safety, and outcome of the main intervention (Favipiravir, Remdesivir,  Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Tocilizumab) for the  treatment of COVID-19 patients and reported the potential limitations of the  included studies. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the  Quality Assessment Tool (QAT) for review articles. We conducted a content  analysis and prepared a narrative summary of the limitations. RESULTS: Forty-six  studies were included in this review. Ninety one percent of the included studies  scored as strong quality and the remaining (9%) as moderate quality. Only 29.7%  of the included systematic reviews have a registered protocol. 26% of the  included studies mentioned a funding statement. The main limitations of the  included studies were categorized in 10 domains: sample size, heterogeneity,  follow-up, treatment, including studies, design, definitions, synthesis, quality,  and search. CONCLUSION: Various limitations have been reported in all the  included studies. Indeed, the existence of limitations in studies can affect  their results, therefore, identifying these limitations can help researchers  design better studies. As a result, stronger studies with more reliable results  will be reported and disseminated. Further research on COVID-19 SRs is essential  to improve research quality and also, efficiency among scientists across the  world.

AB  - Since the emergence of Corona virus disease (COVID-19) in 2019, a number of medications have been developed and tried to combat the pandemic. In the present  study, we develop a LC-MS/MS approach to detect and quantify certain COVID-19  candidate drugs in rat plasma, including Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir,  Oseltamivir, and Remdesivir. The analytes were separated using Ultra  High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) over a 13-minute run on a C(18)  column. The extraction solvent for the (QuEChERS) quick, easy, cheap, effective,  rugged and safe method was methanol, while the clean-up phase was primary  secondary amine (PSA). Satisfactory recoveries were achieved for all compounds  ranging from 82.39 to 105.87 %, with standard deviations smaller than 15.7. In  terms of precision, accuracy, linearity, matrix effect, and stability, the method  was validated according to US FDA criteria. The Limit of Detection (LOD) was  determined to be between 0.11 and 10 ppb. The approach was further developed for  a modest pharmacokinetic research in laboratory rats, and thus can be suitable  for therapeutic drug monitoring in clinical cases under the same treatment.

AB  - Three new mixed-ligand copper(II) complexes (1-3) with NN'O type unsymmetrical tridentate Schiff base ligands (SB) and N-donor heterocyclic co-ligands, with  general formula [Cu(SB)(L)]ClO(4), were synthesized and characterized using  single crystal x-ray diffraction (SCXRD), FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy and  elemental analyses. The SB ligand is the half-unit form of the condensation of  1,3-propanediamine with 5-methoxysalicylaldehyde and the co-ligands (L) are  pyridine (py in (1)), 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy in (2)) and 1,10-phenanthroline (phen  in (3)). Crystal structures of (2) and (3) were obtained by SCXRD. Molecular  docking and pharmacophore studies were performed to study the interactions  between the synthesized complexes and SARS-CoV-2 virus main proteases (PDB IDs:  6LU7, 6WQF and 6W9C). Results revealed that complex (3) with phen co-ligand  showed better docking scores with the three receptors, i.e. 6LU7  (-8.05 kcal.mol(-1)), 6W9C (-7.70 kcal.mol(-1)) and 6WQF (-7.75 kcal.mol(-1)).  The order of the binding best energies for (3) was also as follows:  6LU7 > 6WQF > 6W9C. All of the studied complexes showed considerable performance,  comparable to the standard drug, Favipiravir.

AB  - The novel coronavirus pandemic poses a major global threat to public health. Our knowledge concerning every aspect of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly, given the  increasing data from all over the world. In this narrative review, the Turkish  Thoracic Society Early Career Taskforce members aimed to provide a summary on  recent literature regarding epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnosis,  treatment, prevention, and control of COVID-19. Studies revealed that the genetic  sequence of the novel coronavirus showed significant identity to SARS-CoV and  MERS-CoV. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor is an important target of the  SARS-CoV-2 while entering an organism. Smokers were more likely to develop the  disease and have a higher risk for ICU admission. The mean incubation period was  6.4 days, whereas asymptomatic transmission was reported up to 25 days after  infection. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, and cardiovascular  diseases and hypertension were reported to be the most common comorbidities among  patients. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic and mild disease to  severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several patients showed typical  symptoms and radiological changes with negative RT-PCR but positive IgG and IgM  antibodies. Although radiological findings may vary, bilateral, peripherally  distributed, ground-glass opacities were typical of COVID-19. Poor prognosis was  associated with older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and  high D-dimer level. Chloroquine was found to be effective in reducing viral  replication in vitro. Likewise, protease inhibitors, including  lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, and nucleoside analogue remdesivir were  proposed to be the potential drug candidates in COVID-19 management. Despite  these efforts, we still have much to learn regarding the transmission, treatment,  and prevention of COVID-19.

AB  - Modern pharmaceutical analysis is paying a lot of attention to the stability of novel drug formulations as well as establishment of suitable stability-indicating  approaches. In the current work, a comprehensive stability-indicating HPLC-DAD  method has been developed and validated for determination of favipiravir (FAV)  which is a novel and emerging antiviral option in COVID-19 treatment. The  stability of FAV was examined under different stress conditions. FAV was found to  be susceptible to acid, base hydrolysis and oxidative degradation. Structure  elucidation of the forced degradation products was carried out using mass  spectrometry (MS) operated in electrospray ionization mode. Effective separation  of FAV and its induced degradation products was achieved using isocratic elution  mode on Zorbax C(18) column maintained at 30 °C. The mobile phase used was  comprised of 25.0 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3.5 ± 0.05) containing 0.1% (w/v)  heptane sulphonic acid sodium salt-methanol-acetonitrile (62:28:10, by volume),  delivered at flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The diode array detector signal for FAV was  monitored at 321.0 nm over a concentration range of 6.25-250.00 µg/mL. The  potential mechanisms for generation of degradation products were postulated  through comparison of MS(1) fragmentation pattern of FAV and its degradation  products. Moreover, the proposed method was also extended to study the  degradation kinetics. Additionally, dissolution profiling of FAV in different  media was monitored. Clearly, the suggested approach is accurate, reliable,  time-saving, and cost-effective. As a result, it may be utilized for regular  quality control and stability assessment of FAV in its tablet dosage form.

AB  - Quality control (QC) of pharmaceutical products requires fast, sensitive as well as economic methodologies in order to provide high through output at low cost  which are the main aspects considered by such economic facilities. Meanwhile, the  ecological impacts must be considered by researchers to minimize the hazardous  effects of research laboratories. Favipiravir (FAV) is an antiviral agent  recently approved for treatment of COVID-19 infections during 2020 pandemic  crisis, so the size of its production by international pharmaceutical  corporations evolved dramatically within the past few months. Two novel simple,  sensitive, and green methods were developed and validated for FAV determination  based on solvent-free micellar LC and spectrofluorimetry techniques. To improve  FAV native fluorescence, several factors were studied including solvent type,  buffering, pH and added surfactants. The best sensitivity for FAV fluorescence  was obtained in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 4) at 436 nm after excitation at  323 nm within concentration range of 20-350 ng mL(-1). Another HPLC method was  validated using C18-RP (5 µm, 250 × 4.6 mm) stationary phase and solvent-free  mobile phase consisting of (0.02 M Brij-35, 0.15 M SDS, and 0.02 M disodium  hydrogen phosphate, pH 5.0) isocratically eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1)  and detection wavelength of 323 nm. LC method was validated across concentration  range of 10-100 µg mL(-1) and FAV eluted in 3.8 min. The methods were validated  according to the FDA guidelines and were applied successfully for determination  of FAV in its marketed tablet dosage forms and in spiked human plasma samples.  The proposed methods are eco-friendly since they are typically based on  biodegradable reagents in aqueous solvent-free phases, which was proven by their  assessment on two recent greenness metrics (GAPI and AGREE) to prove their  eco-friendly properties.

AB  - Drug repurposing is also termed as drug repositioning or therapeutic switching. This method is applied to identify the novel therapeutic agents from the existing  FDA approved clinically used drug molecules. It is considered as an efficient  approach to develop drug candidates with new pharmacological activities or  therapeutic properties. As the drug discovery is a costly, time-consuming,  laborious, and highly risk process, the novel approach of drug repositioning is  employed to increases the success rate of drug development. This strategy is more  advantageous over traditional drug discovery process in terms of reducing  duration of drug development, low-cost, highly efficient and minimum risk of  failure. In addition to this, World health organization declared Coronavirus  disease (COVID-19) as pandemic globally on February 11, 2020. Currently, there is  an urgent need to develop suitable therapeutic agents for the prevention of the  outbreak of COVID-19. So, various investigations were carried out to design novel  drug molecules by utilizing different approaches of drug repurposing to identify  drug substances for treatment of COVID-19, which can act as significant  inhibitors against viral proteins. It has been reported that COVID-19 can infect  human respiratory system by entering into the alveoli of lung via respiratory  tract. So, the infection occurs due to specific interaction or binding of spike  protein with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. Hence, drug  repurposing strategy is utilized to identify suitable drugs by virtual screening  of drug libraries. This approach helps to determine the binding interaction of  drug candidates with target protein of coronavirus by using computational tools  such as molecular similarity and homology modeling etc. For predicting the  drug-receptor interactions and binding affinity, molecular docking study and  binding free energy calculations are also performed. The methodologies involved  in drug repurposing can be categorized into three groups such as drug-oriented,  target-oriented and disease or therapy-oriented depending on the information  available related to quality and quantity of the physico-chemical, biological,  pharmacological, toxicological and pharmacokinetic property of drug molecules.  This review focuses on drug repurposing strategy applied for existing drugs  including Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin, Baraticinib, Tocilizumab,  Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Prulifloxacin, Carfilzomib, Bictegravir,  Nelfinavir, Tegobuvir and Glucocorticoids etc to determine their effectiveness  toward the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report a case of endogenous panophthalmitis in a patient with COVID-19 during treatment in an Intensive Care Unit. OBSERVATION: A 64-year-old  woman with COVID-19 and Salmonella septicemia presented with decreased visual  acuity, ocular pain, and proptosis in her right eye after treatment with  favipiravir, intravenous dexamethasone, and ceftriaxone. An ocular examination of  her right eye revealed periorbital tenderness, exophthalmos, and corneal haze.  The ultrasonography showed a subretinal abscess. Her right eye lost light  perception vision and underwent enucleation. Microbiologic evaluation of the  enucleated right eye was negative for organisms. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE:  Patents with COVID-19 may develop severe ocular involvement after COVID-19 due to  a generalized reduction in immunity. Comorbidities and intensive care unit  treatments can predispose COVID-19 patients to endogenous panophthalmitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing community awareness about the transmission and treatment of COVID-19 will stop the spread of the virus. Pharmacy students are the  potential facilitator to give community education about COVID-19 treatment. The  objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacy students' knowledge of  COVID-19 treatment, behavior, and attitude of providing the information about  COVID-19 treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional study,  recruiting 429 pharmacy students from three schools of pharmacy in Indonesia. The  questionnaire about the knowledge of COVID-19 treatment, behavior, and attitude  of providing the information on COVID-19 treatment met the validity and  reliability criteria. We defined the proportion of knowledge, behavior, and  attitude of the students using SPSS(®) version 22. RESULTS: Most of the students  are in the earlier years (46.63%), female (84.15%), find the information about  COVID-19 from many sources of media (85.08%) including scientific articles and  know information about COVID-19 transmission around their life area (76.46%). The  students' knowledge about antiviral and plasma convalescent is good (>70%), the  positive behaviors are related to the COVID-19 treatment information regarding to  the antiviral and the provision of Vitamin C (>50%), and the positive attitude  are related to giving information about the use of avigan®, plasma convalescent,  chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and immunomodulator (>50%). CONCLUSIONS: As a  future pharmacist, the knowledge of pharmacy students about COVID-19 treatment  needs to be improved since earlier years. Furthermore, using the good knowledge  about COVID-19 treatment, the positive behavior and attitude of providing  information of the students, the community behavior and attitude will be  improved. The high year students have a tendency for the good knowledge and  positive behavior and attitude of providing the information.

AB  - A two-layer ONIOM(B3LYP/6-31G*:PM7) method is used to model the binding of several drug/drug-like molecules (L) at the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein: human ACE2  protein interface cavity. The selected molecules include a set of thirty-five  ligands from the study of Smith and Smith which showed a high docking score in  the range of -7.0 to -7.7 kcal/mol and another set of seven repurposing drugs,  viz. favipiravir, remdesivir, EIDD, galidesivir, triazavirin, ruxolitinib, and  baricitinib. The ONIOM model of the cavity (M) showed a highly polarized electron  distribution along its top-to-bottom direction while Ls with lengths in the range  1.0 - 1.5 nm fitted well inside the cavity in a head-to-tail fashion to yield ML  complexes. The ligands showed a large variation in the ONIOM-level binding energy  (E(b)), in the range -2.7 to -85.4 kcal/mol. The E(b) of ML complexes better than  -40.0 kcal/mol is observed for myricetin, fidarestat, protirelin, m-digallic  acid, glucogallin, benserazide hydrochlorideseradie, remdesivir, tazobactum,  sapropterin, nitrofurantoin, quinonoid, pyruvic acid calcium isoniazid, and  aspartame, and among them the highest E(b) -85.4 kcal/mol is observed for  myricetin. A hydroxy substitution is suggested for the phenyl ring of aspartame  to improve its binding behavior at the cavity, and the resulting ligand 43 showed  the best E(b) -84.5 kcal/mol. The ONIOM-level study is found to be effective for  the interpretation of the noncovalent interactions resulting from residues such  as arginine, histidine, tyrosine, lysine, carboxylate, and amide moieties in the  active site and suggests rational design strategies for COVID-19 drug  development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has different presentations from mild flu like symptoms such as anosmia, dysgeusia, fever, sore throat, cough, dyspnea, headache, abdominal  pain and diarrhoea to severe COVID-19 with the development of acute respiratory  syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction,  multiorgan failure or even death. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research project was  to present and highlight the outcomes of the vaccination against COVID-19 and the  widespread use of antibiotics during the initial admission and treatment of  COVID-19 patients in out of hospital settings. METHODS: This observational  cross-sectional study was conducted between September 1st and September 24th  2021, during the fourth wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Bosnia and Herzegovina,  among the patients admitted to the primary health care COVID-19 centre of Canton  Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina. RESULTS: Patients were mostly female 213  (53.3%), with a mean age of 48.8±18.6, with hypertension 129 (32.3%) or diabetes  mellitus 35 (8.7%) as comorbidities and being COVID-19 unvaccinated 236 (59.0%)  COVID-19 unvaccinated patients expressed more fever (X (2)=9.93, p<0.05), had  typical COVID-19 chest X ray presentation (X (2)=6.08, p<0.05) and abnormal lung  auscultation sounds (X (2)=5.43, p<0.05). Out of all patients, 312 (78.0%) have  received antibiotics and 3 (0.75%) antivirotics such as favipiravir as therapy  for the treatment of COVID-19. The mean duration of the antibiotic regime was  10.2 ± 7.5 days with a minimum of 3 days and maximum of 62 days. The minimum CRP  value when antibiotics were prescribed was 0.1 (ref. value <5mg/l). The most  prescribed antibiotic was doxycycline 172 (43.0%), followed by ceftriaxone 139  (34.7%) and azithromycin 108 (27.0%). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that  vaccination acts protective for the development of severe COVID-19 forms, as well  as that antibiotics were overused among COVID-19 infected. The outcome of such  malpractice could lead to antimicrobial resistance which will be seen in further  years. Governmental agencies should advise physicians to change these trends.

AB  - The role of repurposed or modified antiviral drugs has become more significant during the current global pandemic of SARS Covid-19. In the present study, four  structurally analogous impurity molecules of antiviral drug Favipiravir are  selected for preliminary computational investigation for assessing the  structure-activity relationship. The optimized geometry and the electronic  structures of the compounds are computed using Density Functional Theory as a  precursor to evaluating their physical, chemical and spectral properties. The  frontier orbitals analysis is performed to obtain global reactivity parameters  namely, the chemical potential, absolute electronegativity, global softness,  global hardness, electrophilicity, etc. The natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis  and Mulliken analysis provided an understanding of the charge-transfer  interactions of molecules. The possibilities of intermolecular interactions of  the drug systems with the receptors are also visualized using the electrostatic  potential maps (MEP) derived from the DFT computations. The physiochemical  properties are assessed computationally using SwissADME webtool to correlate the  structural aspects of the compounds with their biological responses. Useful  parameters namely flexibility, lipophilicity, size, polarity, solubility and  saturation were also computed to evaluate the therapeutic activity or  drug-likeness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall. ex Nees (AP) has been widely used in Thailand to treat mild COVID-19 infections since early 2020; however,  supporting evidence is scarce and ambiguous. Thus, this study aimed to examine  whether the use of AP is associated with a decreased risk of pneumonia in  hospitalised mild COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data  between March 2020 and August 2021 from COVID-19 patients admitted to one  hospital in Thailand. Patients whose infection was confirmed by real-time  polymerase chain reaction, had normal chest radiography and did not receive  favipiravir at admission were included and categorised as either AP (deriving  from a dried and ground aerial part of the plant), given as capsules with a total  daily dose of 180 mg andrographolide for 5 days or standard of care. They were  followed for pneumonia confirmed by chest radiography. Multiple logistic  regression was used for the analysis controlling for age, sex, diabetes,  hypertension, statin use, and antihypertensive drug use. RESULTS: A total of 605  out of 1,054 patients (mostly unvaccinated) were included in the analysis. Of  these, 59 patients (9.8%) developed pneumonia during the median follow-up of 7  days. The incidence rates of pneumonia were 13.93 (95% CI 10.09, 19.23) and 12.47  (95% CI 8.21, 18.94) per 1,000 person-days in the AP and standard of care groups,  respectively. Compared to the standard of care group, the odds ratios of having  pneumonia in the AP group were 1.24 (95% CI 0.71, 2.16; unadjusted model) and  1.42 (95% CI 0.79, 2.55; fully adjusted model). All sensitivity analyses were  consistent with the main results. CONCLUSION: The use of AP was not significantly  associated with a decreased risk of pneumonia in mild COVID-19 patients. While  waiting for insights from ongoing trials, AP's use in COVID-19 should be done  with caution.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak triggered a serious and potentially lethal pandemic, resulting in massive health and economic losses worldwide. The most common  clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients are pneumonia and acute respiratory  distress syndrome, with a variety of complications. Multiple organ failure and  damage, ultimately leading to patient death, are possible as a result of  medication combinations, and this is exemplified by DILI. We hope to summarize  DILI caused by the antiviral drugs favipiravir, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir,  and hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients in this review. The incidence of  liver injury in the treatment of COVID-19 patients was searched on PubMed to  investigate DILI cases. The cumulative prevalence of acute liver injury was 23.7%  (16.1%-33.1%). We discuss the frequency of these events, potential mechanisms,  and new insights into surveillance strategies. Furthermore, we also describe  medication recommendations aimed at preserving DILI caused by treatment in  COVID-19 patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: To elucidate the clinical course of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treated at a specialized hospital mainly for those with mild and  moderate severity during the third wave, and to compare that with the first and  second (1st/2nd) waves. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the severity on  admission, treatment, and outcome of a total of 581 patients from September,  2020, to March, 2021, and examined the risk factors for deterioration of  respiratory condition, defined as requiring oxygen ≥ 7 L/min for 12 h. RESULTS:  The median age was 78 (interquartile range 62-83) years, older than in the  1st/2nd waves (53 years), and 50% of the patients was male. The number of  patients classified as mild (peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) ≥ 96%),  moderate I, II, and severe (requiring admission to the ICU or mechanical  ventilation) was 121, 324, 132, and 4, respectively. Favipiravir, ciclesonide,  dexamethasone, and/or heparin were administered for treatment. Respiratory  condition recovered in 496 (85%) patients. It worsened in 81 patients (14%); 51  (9%) of whom were transferred to tertiary hospitals and 30 (5%) died. Mortality  rate increased by fivefold compared during the 1st/2nd waves. Age, male sex,  increased body mass index, and C-reactive protein (CRP) on admission were  responsible for worsening of the respiratory condition. CONCLUSION: Patients were  older in the third wave compared with the 1st/2nd waves. Respiratory condition  recovered in 85%; whereas 5% of the patients died. Old age, male sex, increased  body mass index, and CRP would be responsible for worsening of the respiratory  condition.

AB  - The top priority of any nation is to lead the nation towards prosperity, progress, and economic growth, confronting several challenges and concerns arisen  from global situations. The sudden outbreak of any disease defies the health care  systems and economy of nations. COVID-19 is one of the viral diseases which broke  out in Wuhan city of China in 2019. COVID-19 outbreak intermittently prevailed  all over the world. It exposes the fragility of the established health care  systems across the world in spite of comprising modern science and technology.  Unfortunately, there is no chemotherapeutic agent in the regimen of antiviral  drugs or no vaccine available to curb this infectious disease. As a consequence,  this deadly infection has prevailed all over the world. The antiviral drugs used  for viral diseases excluding COVID-19 infection are Ramdesvir, Favipiravir, and  Ribavarin, and antimalarial agents (Chloroquine & Hydroxychloroquine) are being  administered to the patients for redemption of this infection. Fortunately, these  existing drugs have been found clinically active and are being used. In this  review, we present the current scenario and status of epidemiology, diagnosis,  treatment, vaccine development for COVID-19, and its impact on the socio-economic  structure.

AB  - It is critical to characterize the degradation products of therapeutic drugs to determine their safety as these degradation products may possess fatal effects on  the human physiological system. Favipiravir (FVP), a novel anti-Covid-19 drug,  that is recently used all over the world with a great impact on humanity was our  target to explore more about its toxicity, the margins of its safety, and its  degradants in different degradation conditions. The goal of this study is to  identify, characterize, and confirm the structures of FVP oxidative and alkaline  breakdown products, as well as to assess their safety utilizing in-vitro SRB  cytotoxicity assay on normal human skin fibroblasts (NHSF) cell lines. After  oxidative and alkaline degradation of FVP, one degradation product was produced  in each condition which was isolated from FVP using flash chromatography,  characterized by (1)HNMR and LC-MS/MS techniques. A reversed-phase Thermo Fischer  Hypersil C(18) column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 m) was used to achieve HPLC  chromatographic separation. Acetonitrile-5 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate (pH  2.5) (50:50, v/v) was employed as the mobile phase, with a flow rate of 1 mL/min.  At 332 nm, the column effluent was measured. Over the concentration range of  0.5-100 µg/mL, the calibration curve was linear. The intra-day and inter-day  relative standard deviations were less than 2%, and good percentage recoveries  were obtained that fulfilled the acceptance criteria of the International  Conference on Harmonization (ICH) recommendations. The Plackett-Burman design was  used to assess the robustness. Each degradant was isolated single using Flash  chromatography and methylene chloride: methanol gradient mobile phase. The  chemical structures of the degradation products have been confirmed and compared  to the intact FVP using (1)H-NMR, and Mass spectroscopy. A postulated mechanism  of the degradation process has been depicted and the degradants fragmentation  pattern has been portrayed. In addition, the in vitro SRB cytotoxicity assay to  evaluate the safety profile of FVP and the degradation end products showed their  high safety margin in both conditions with IC(50) ˃100 µg/ml with no signs of  toxicity upon examination of the treated NHSF cells under the optical microscope.

AB  - As yet, no agents have been approved for the treatment of COVID-19, although several experimental drugs are being used off licence. These may have serious  adverse effects and potential drug interactions with psychotropic agents. We  reviewed the common agents being used across the world for the treatment of  COVID-19 and investigated their drug interaction potential with psychotropic  agents using several drug interaction databases and resources. A preliminary  search identified the following drugs as being used to treat COVID-19 symptoms:  atazanavir (ATV), azithromycin (AZI), chloroquine (CLQ)/hydroxychloroquine  (HCLQ), dipyridamole, famotidine (FAM), favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r),  nitazoxanide, remdesivir, ribavirin and tocilizumab. Many serious adverse effects  and potential drug interactions with psychotropic agents were identified. The  most problematic agents were found to be ATV, AZI, CLQ, HCLQ, FAM and LPV/r in  terms of both pharmacokinetic as well as serious pharmacodynamic drug  interactions, including QTc prolongation and neutropenia. Significant caution  should be exercised if using any of the medications being trialled for the  treatment of COVID-19 until robust clinical trial data are available. An even  higher threshold of vigilance should be maintained for patients with pre-existing  conditions and older adults due to added toxicity and drug interactions,  especially with psychotropic agents.

AB  - Development of new drugs is a time-taking and expensive process. Comprehensive efforts are being made globally toward the search of therapeutics against  SARS-CoV-2. Several drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ritonavir, and  lopinavir have been included in the treatment regimen and shown effective results  in several cases. Among the existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, remdesivir  is found to be more effective against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir has broad-spectrum  antiviral action against many single-stranded RNA viruses including pathogenic  SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In this  study, we proposed that remdesivir strongly binds to membrane protein (Mprotein),  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), and main protease (Mprotease) of SARS-CoV-2.  It might show antiviral activity by inhibiting more than one target. It has been  found that remdesivir binds to Mprotease, Mprotein, and RDRP with -7.8, -7.4, and  -7.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The structure dynamics study suggested that binding  of remdesivir leads to unfolding of RDRP. It has been found that strong binding  of remdesivir to Mprotein leads to decrease in structural deviations and  gyrations. Additionally, the average solvent-accessible surface area of Mprotein  decreases from 127.17 to 112.12 nm(2), respectively. Furthermore, the eigenvalues  and the trace of the covariance matrix were found to be low in case of  Mprotease-remdesivir, Mprotein-remdesivir, and RDRP-remdesivir. Binding of  remdesivir to Mprotease, Mprotein, and RDRP reduces the average motions in  protein due to its strong binding. The MMPBSA calculations also suggested that  remdesivir has strong binding affinity with Mprotein, Mprotease, and RDRP. The  detailed analysis suggested that remdesivir has more than one target of  SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence and prognosis of COVID-19 and rheumatic disease vary among ethnicities and regions. COVID-19 outcomes in rheumatic disease patients  remain unclear, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. This study aimed to  clarify the demographic and clinical factors that may influence COVID-19  prognosis in rheumatic disease patients. METHODS: This was a case series of  patients registered with the COVID-19 national registry of Japan College of  Rheumatology between June 3, 2020, and June 30, 2021. Multivariable logistic  regression was used to estimate the risk of hospitalization or death. Age, sex,  smoking status, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities, and rheumatic disease  medications are taken immediately before infection was analyzed. RESULTS: A total  of 220 patients from 55 institutions in Japan were included in the study, among  whom 186 (84.5%) were hospitalized and 11 (5.0%) died. COVID-19 treatments were  provided to 126 patients (57.3%), and mainly comprised glucocorticoids,  favipiravir, remdesivir, and tocilizumab. In the multiple logistic regression  model, older age and a history of hypertension were associated with  hospitalization, while older age was associated with mortality. No specific  treatment was correlated with mortality or hospitalization by the multi-variate  analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and hypertension were associated with a poor  prognosis in Japanese COVID-19 patients with CTD. Factors not directly related to  CTD were closely associated with the prognosis.

AB  - Coronavirus outbreak is still a major public health concern. The high mutation ability of SARS-CoV-2 periodically delivers more transmissible and dangerous  variants. Hence, the necessity for an efficient and inexpensive antiviral agent  is urgent. In this work, pyrazolone-type compounds were synthesised,  characterised using spectroscopic methods and theoretical tools, and evaluated in  silico against proteins of SARS-CoV-2 responsible for host cell entry and  reproduction processes, i.e., spike protein (S), M(pro), and PL(pro). Five of  twenty compounds are newly synthesised. In addition, the crystal structure of a  pyrazolone derivative bearing a vanillin moiety is determined. The obtained in  silico results indicate a more favourable binding affinity of pyrazolone  analogues towards M(pro), and PL(pro) in comparison to drugs lopinavir,  remdesivir, chloroquine, and favipiravir, while in the case of S protein only  lopinavir exerted higher binding affinity. Also, the investigations were  performed on ACE2 and the spike RBD-ACE2 complex. The obtained results for these  proteins suggest that selected compounds could express antiviral properties by  blocking the binding to the host cell and viral spreading, also. Moreover,  several derivatives expressed multitarget antiviral action, blocking both binding  and reproduction processes. Additionally, in silico ADME/T calculations predicted  favourable features of the synthesised compounds, i.e., drug-likeness, oral  bioavailability, as well as good pharmacokinetic parameters related to  absorption, metabolism, and toxicity. The obtained results imply the great  potential of synthesised pyrazolones as multitarget agents against SARS-CoV-2 and  represent a valuable background for further in vitro investigations.

AB  - Baloxavir marboxil is a new drug developed in Japan by Shionogi to treat seasonal flu infection. This cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor is a prodrug that  releases the biologically active baloxavir acid. This new medicine has been  marketed in Japan, the USA and Europe. It is well tolerated (more than 1% of the  patients experienced diarrhea, bronchitis, nausea, nasopharyngitis, and  headache), and both influenza A and B viruses are sensitive, although the B  strain is more resistant due to variations in the amino acid residues in the  binding site. The drug is now in post-marketing pharmacovigilance phase, and its  interest will be especially re-evaluated in the future during the annual flu  outbreaks. It has been also introduced in a recent clinical trial against  COVID-19 with favipiravir.

AB  - The main antiviral drug-cyclodextrin interactions, changes in physicochemical and physiological properties of the most commonly used virucides are summarized. The  potential complexation of antiviral molecules against the SARS-Cov2 also pointed  out the lack of detailed information in designing effective and general medicines  against viral infections. The principal problem of the current molecules is the  3D structures of the currently active compounds. Improving the solubility or  bioavailability of antiviral molecules is possible, however, there is no  universal solution, and the complexation experiments dominantly use the already  approved cyclodextrin derivatives. This review discusses the basic properties of  the different cyclodextrin derivatives, their potential in antiviral  formulations, and the prevention and treatment of viral infections. The  biologically active new cyclodextrin derivatives are also discussed.

AB  - There is an urgent need for reliable cure and preventive measures in this hour of the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Siddha- and Ayurvedic-based classical formulations  have antiviral properties and great potential therapeutic choice in this pandemic  situation. In the current study, in silico-based analysis for the binding  potential of phytoconstituents from the classical formulations suggested by the  Ministry of Ayush (Kabasura Kudineer, Shwas Kuthar Rasa with Kantakari and  pippali churna, Talisadi churna) to the interface domain of the SARS-CoV-2  receptor-binding domain and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was performed.  Maestro software from Schrodinger and tools like Glide Docking, induced fit  docking, MM-GBSA, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and thermal MM-GBSA was  used to analyze the binding of protein PDB ID:6VW1 and the selected 133 ligands  in comparison with drug molecules like favipiravir and ribavirin. QikProp-based  ADMET evaluation of all the phytoconstituents found them nontoxic and with  drug-like properties. Selection of top ten ligands was made based on docking  score for further MM-GBSA analysis. After performing IFD of top five molecules  iso-chlorogenic acid, taxiphyllin, vasicine, catechin and caffeic acid, MD  simulation and thermal MM-GBSA were done. Iso-chlorogenic acid had formed more  stable interaction with key residue among all phytoconstituents.  Computational-based study has highlighted the potential of the many constituents  of traditional medicine to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2, which might  stop the viral entry into the cell. However, in vivo experiments and clinical  trials are necessary for supporting this claim.

AB  - Cellular drug response (concentration required for obtaining 50% of a maximum cellular effect, EC(50)) can be predicted by the intracellular bioavailability (F  (ic)) and biochemical activity (half-maximal inhibitory concentration, IC(50)) of  drugs. In an ideal model, the cellular negative log of EC(50) (pEC(50)) equals  the sum of log F (ic) and the negative log of IC(50) (pIC(50)). Here, we measured  F (ic)'s of remdesivir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine in various cells and  calculated their anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC(50)'s. The predicted EC(50)'s are close to  the observed EC(50)'s in vitro. When the lung concentrations of antiviral drugs  are higher than the predicted EC(50)'s in alveolar type 2 cells, the antiviral  drugs inhibit virus replication in vivo, and vice versa. Overall, our results  indicate that both in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities of drugs can be  predicted by their intracellular bioavailability and biochemical activity without  using virus. This virus-free strategy can help medicinal chemists and  pharmacologists to screen antivirals during early drug discovery, especially for  researchers who are not able to work in the high-level biosafety lab.

AB  - An outbreak of respiratory disorder caused by coronavirus has been named as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19). To find a specific treatment against this  disease researchers are at the frontline. To cure COVID-19, favipiravir (FPV) has  been reported as an effective drug based on its high recovery rate. Among  nanomaterials, fullerene C60 has achieved enormous attention as a drug delivery  vehicle due to its good bioavailability and low toxicity. Hence, in this work, we  have investigated the potential of metal-doped fullerene as a drug carrier, based  on DFT calculations by using M06-2X functional and 6-31G(d) basis set in water  media. In this research electronic parameters and adsorption energy of FPV on  interaction with metal-doped (Cr, Fe, and Ni) fullerene is studied. The charge  transfer between drug and doped fullerene has been studied through  electrophilicity indexes. The structural and electronic properties are explored  in terms of adsorption energy through frontier molecular orbital (FMO) and  density of state (DOS). It is observed that doping of fullerene C60 with Cr, Fe,  and Ni metals significantly enhances the drug delivery rate and provides numerous  advantages including controlled drug release at specific target sites which  minimize the generic collection in vivo and reduce the side effects. Thusly, it  is suggested that our designed metal-doped complexes might be efficient  candidates as drug delivery materials for COVID-19 infection.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: 'Repurposing' existing drugs to treat COVID-19 is vital to reducing mortality and controlling the pandemic. Several promising drugs have been  identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If efficacy of  these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would  be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and  middle-income economies. METHODS: Minimum costs of production were estimated from  the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology,  which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HIV amongst  others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of  the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list  prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available. RESULTS:  Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day  for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine,  $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for  sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of production ranged  between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days). Current prices of these  drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US.  CONCLUSIONS: Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they  could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current  list prices. Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price  negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at  low prices globally.

AB  - Two new mixed-ligand complexes with general formula [Cu(SB)(L')]ClO(4) (1 and 2) were synthesized and characterized by different spectroscopic and analytical  techniques including Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and UV-Vis spectroscopy  and elemental analyses. The SB ligand is an unsymmetrical tridentate NN'O type  Schiff base ligand that was derived from the condensation of 1,2-ethylenediamine  and 5-bromo-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzaldehyde. The L' ligand is pyridine in (1) and  2,2'-dimethyl-4,4'-bithiazole (BTZ) in (2). Crystal structure of (2) was also  obtained. The two complexes were used as anticancer agents against leukemia  cancer cell line HL-60 and showed considerable anticancer activity. The  anticancer activity of these complexes was comparable with the standard drug  5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Molecular docking and pharmacophore studies were also  performed on DNA (PDB:1BNA) and leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) (PDB:1EMR) to  further investigate the anticancer and anti-COVID activity of these complexes.  The molecular docking results against DNA revealed that (1) preferentially binds  to the major groove of DNA receptor whereas (2) binds to the minor groove.  Complex (2) performed better with 1EMR. The experimental and theoretical results  showed good correlation. Molecular docking and pharmacophore studies were also  applied to study the interactions between the synthesized complexes and  SARS-CoV-2 virus receptor protein (PDB ID:6LU7). The results revealed that  complex (2) had better interaction than (1), the free ligands (SB and BTZ), and  the standard drug favipiravir.

AB  - (1) Background: The purpose of this article is to review pharmacological treatments for COVID-19 (currently approved by the EMA (European Medical Agency)  and FDA (Food and Drug Administration)) and highlight their potential  audio-vestibular side-effects as an ototoxic adverse reaction. (2) Methods:  Review of the available literature in the scientific databases PubMed,  ResearchGate, Scopus, and ScienceDirect, and in summaries of product data sheets.  (3) Results: In accordance with EBM (evidence-based medicine) the treatment of  COVID-19 by using lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine,  azithromycin, favipiravir, amantadine, oseltamivir, and ivermectin is no longer  recommended for patients suffering from COVID-19 due to a lack of clinical data,  publications, and recommendations. There were 39 publications and 15 summaries of  product characteristics (as other sources of data) which were also used in this  analysis. Adverse events could be permanent or disappear over time. Following  treatment for COVID-19, the most frequent adverse audio-vestibular reactions  reported in clinical trials and publications in the area of audiology and  otorhinolaryngology were: dizziness, blurry vision with dizziness,  nasopharyngitis, dysgeusia, and tinnitus. As far as vaccines are concerned,  dizziness as an ototoxic effect was uncommon and occurs only in hypersensitive  people who experience anaphylactic shock. (4) Conclusions: The ototoxicity of the  drugs discussed here does not have as severe symptoms as the drugs used in the  treatment of COVID-19 in 2020 (e.g., hydroxychloroquine), and relates mainly to  disorders of the vestibulocochlear system. However, there is still a need to  monitor ototoxic side-effects because of potential interactions with other  ototoxic drugs. Many of the drugs approved by EMA and FDA are new, and not every  side-effect is known.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of a case of bilateral acute iris transillumination (BAIT) developed after COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD:  Case report. CASE: A 66-year-old male patient with COVID-19 pneumonia received  systemic treatments of favipiravir, prednisolone, moxifloxacin and  piperacillin-tazobactam during hospitalization. The patient applied to our clinic  with the complaint of blurred vision 20 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. The  best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.3 in the right eye and 0.5 in the left  eye. In the anterior segment examination; ciliary injection, intense pigment  dispersion in the anterior chamber, pigment deposits on the lens and iris,  2-3 + cells in the anterior chamber, posterior synechia, and 360 degrees diffuse  iris transillumination were observed in both eyes. The pupillary response to  light was weak. Bilateral fundus examination were normal. In the anterior chamber  sample; HSV, VZV, CMV and Toxoplasma PCR were negative. Bilateral acute iris  transillumination (BAIT) diagnosed in the patient and topical 0.1% dexamethasone  and topical 1% cyclopentolate were started. In the follow-up, visual acuity  increased 1.0 in both eyes, there were no cells in the anterior chamber, and the  pigment dispersion was still continuing despite a decrease. CONCLUSION: BAIT,  which can usually be seen after upper respiratory tract infections, can also be  seen after covid 19 pneumonia and be kept in mind as a possible eye involvement  in patients with COVID-19 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV virus infection results in a dysbalanced and severe inflammatory response with hypercytokinemia and immunodepression. Viral infection  triggers systemic inflammation and the virus itself can potentially cause  vascular damage, including blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and alterations  in the coagulation system, which may result in cardiovascular and neurovascular  events. Here, we review the literature and present a case of COVID-19 infection  leading to an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH). CASE DESCRIPTION: A  61-year-old woman presented with dyspnea, cough, and fever. She had a history of  hypertension and was overweight with a body mass-index of 34. There was no  history of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the family. Due to low oxygen saturation  (89%) she was admitted into ICU. A chest CT showed a typical picture of COVID-19  pneumonia. The PCR-based test of an oropharyngeal swab was COVID-19-positive. In  addition to oxygen support she was prescribed with favipiravir and  hydroxychloroquine. She experienced a sudden headache and lost consciousness on  the second day. Computer tomography (CT) with CT-angiography revealed a  subarachnoid haemorrhage in the basal cisterns from a ruptured anterior  communicating artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was clipped microsurgically through a  left-sided standard pterional approach and the patient was admitted again to the  intensive care unit for further intensive medical treatment. Post-operatively,  the patient showed slight motor dysphasia. No other neurological deficits.  CONCLUSION: Systemic inflammation and ventilator support-associated blood  pressure fluctuations may trigger aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage secondary  to COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 infection could be considered as one of the  possible risk factors leading to instability and rupture of intracranial  aneurysm.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Spinal cord injury is mostly caused by traumatic accident and usually associated with several injuries. The ideal treatment of  orthopaedic injury is to perform surgical decompression and stabilization early.  CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old-male patient came in emergency department with  history of severe pain in his thoracic vertebrae after fell from 10 m height. His  buttock was hit the ground first and patient was alert. He felt hypoesthesia  below the injured level and dysfunctional motor and sensory of both lower  extremities. We put pedicle screw at the C7, Th1, Th2 and Th 3. Then we put rods  and nuts. After that, we did decompression by laminectomy of the C7 and Th1 and  we put vacuumed drain for the wound. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: This patient was  diagnosed with traumatic spinal cord injury of 1st thoracic vertebra ASIA  Impairment Scale (AIS) C and sacral fracture Denis classification zone II of  right side with confirmed Covid-19 case. First patient treated with 1000 mg  methyl prednisolone. An early surgical treatment was open reduction and internal  fixation (ORIF) sacral fracture. We put a two-hole 4.5 narrow dynamic compression  plate (DCP) at the lateral side of posterior ridge of iliac bone, between  posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) and posterior inferior iliac spine (PIIS).  CONCLUSION: Immediate surgical decompression and stabilization for spinal cord  injury give significant improvement in motor and sensory function. Appropriate  management for Covid-19 patient with Favipiravir and some supplements, had been  proved control the virus and give patient good quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies investigate the role of pharmacological treatments on disease course in Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Sex disparities in  genetics, immunological responses, and hormonal mechanisms may underlie the  substantially higher fatality rates reported in male COVID-19 patients. To  optimise care for COVID-19 patients, prophylactic and therapeutic studies should  include sex-specific design and analyses. Therefore, in this scoping review, we  investigated whether studies on pharmacological treatment in COVID-19 were  performed based on a priori sex-specific design or post-hoc sex-specific  analyses. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, UpToDate, clinical  trial.org, and MedRxiv for studies on pharmacological treatment for COVID-19  until June 6th, 2020. We included case series, randomized controlled trials, and  observational studies in humans (≥18 years) investigating antiviral,  antimalarial, and immune system modulating drugs. Data were collected on 1) the  proportion of included females, 2) whether sex stratification was performed (a  priori by design or post-hoc), and 3) whether effect modification by sex was  investigated. FINDINGS: 30 studies were eligible for inclusion, investigating  remdesivir (n = 2), lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 5), favipiravir (n = 1), umifenovir  (n = 1), hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (n = 8), convalescent plasma (n = 6),  interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway inhibitors (n = 5), interleukin-1 (IL-1) pathway  inhibitors (n = 1) and corticosteroids (n = 3). Only one study stratified its  data based on sex in a post-hoc analysis, whereas none did a priori by design.  None of the studies investigated effect modification by sex. A quarter of the  studies included twice as many males as females. INTERPRETATION: Analyses  assessing potential interference of sex with (side-)effects of pharmacological  therapy for COVID-19 are rarely reported. Considering sex differences in  case-fatality rates and genetic, immunological, and hormonal mechanisms, studies  should include sex-specific analyses in their design to optimise COVID-19 care.  FUNDING: None.

AB  - Since the first case was diagnosed in China, the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has become the number one issue in the world and it seems to remain  trend-topic for a long time. Until 17 April, it affected 210 countries, infected  over 2 million people and caused approximately 150000 deaths. Although the course  of the disease ranges from asymptomatic state to severe ARDS; the majority of  patients reveal only mild symptoms. Though adults are the most commonly affected  group; it can also be seen in newborns and elderly patients. Unfortunately,  elderly patients are the most vulnerable group with higher mortality. Elderly  patients, smokers and patients with comorbid conditions are most affected by the  disease. In certain diagnostical tool is the real-time reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) test. However, it can  be resulted in false-negative results and in this case the computed thorax  tomography (CT) is one of the most important tools with high sensitivity. Besides  the supportive treatment, most commonly used agents are immunomodulatory drugs  such as plaquenil and azitromycin, and anti-virals including oseltamivir,  ritonavir-lopinavir, favipiravir. Until a vaccine or a specific therapy invented,  the most important intervention to control the disease is to fight against  transmission. This is a real war and the doctors are the soldiers.

AB  - COVID-19 affects several human genes, each with its own p-value. The combination of drugs associated with these genes with small p-values may lead to an  estimation of the combined p-value between COVID-19 and some drug combinations,  thereby increasing the effectiveness of these combinations in defeating the  disease. Based on human genes, we introduced a new machine learning method that  offers an effective drug combination with low combined p-values between them and  COVID-19. This study follows an improved approach to systematic reviews, called  the Systematic Review and Artificial Intelligence Network Meta-Analysis (RAIN),  registered within PROSPERO (CRD42021256797), in which, the PRISMA criterion is  still considered. Drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 were searched in the  databases of ScienceDirect, Web of Science (WoS), ProQuest, Embase, Medline  (PubMed), and Scopus. In addition, using artificial intelligence and the  measurement of the p-value between human genes affected by COVID-19 and drugs  that have been suggested by clinical experts, and reported within the identified  research papers, suitable drug combinations are proposed for the treatment of  COVID-19. During the systematic review process, 39 studies were selected. Our  analysis shows that most of the reported drugs, such as azithromycin and  hydroxyl-chloroquine on their own, do not have much of an effect on the recovery  of COVID-19 patients. Based on the result of the new artificial intelligence, on  the other hand, at a significance level of less than 0.05, the combination of the  two drugs therapeutic corticosteroid + camostat with a significance level of  0.02, remdesivir + azithromycin with a significance level of 0.03, and  interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein + camostat with a significance level  0.02 are considered far more effective for the treatment of COVID-19 and are  therefore recommended. Additionally, at a significance level of less than 0.01,  the combination of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein + camostat +  azithromycin + tocilizumab + oseltamivir with a significance level of 0.006, and  the combination of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein + camostat +  chloroquine + favipiravir + tocilizumab7 with corticosteroid + camostat +  oseltamivir + remdesivir + tocilizumab at a significant level of 0.009 are  effective in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and are also recommended.  The results of this study provide sets of effective drug combinations for the  treatment of patients with COVID-19. In addition, the new artificial intelligence  used in the RAIN method could provide a forward-looking approach to clinical  trial studies, which could also be used effectively in the treatment of diseases  such as cancer.

AB  - Introduction: Drugs with no indication for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (e.g., drugs employed to treat COVID-19) can increase the risk of  arrhythmias. Of interest, a six-fold increase in the number of arrhythmic events  was reported in patients with severe COVID-19. In this study, we reviewed (i) the  pro-arrhythmic action of drugs given to patients with COVID-19 infection, and  (ii) the effects of inflammatory cytokines on cardiac ion channels and possible  generation of arrhythmias. Methods: We conducted a literature search on the drugs  with purported or demonstrated efficacy against COVID-19 disease, emphasizing the  mechanisms by which anti-COVID-19 drugs and inflammatory cytokines interfere with  cardiac ion channels. Results: Antibiotics (azithromycin), antimalarials  (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine), antivirals (ritonavir/lopinavir, atazanavir),  and some of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (vandetanib) could induce long QT and  increase risk for ventricular arrhythmias. The pro-arrhythmic action results from  drug-induced inhibition of Kv11.1 (hERG) channels interfering with the  repolarizing potassium IKr currents, leading to long QT and increased risk of  triggered arrhythmias. At higher concentrations, these drugs may interfere with  IKs, IK1, and/or Ito potassium currents, and even inhibit sodium (INa) and  calcium (ICa) currents, inducing additional cardiac toxicity. Ibrutinib, an  inhibitor of Bruton's TK, increased the incidence of atrial fibrillation and  ventricular tachycardia associated with a short QT interval. Inflammatory  cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α inhibit IKr and Ito repolarizing potassium currents.  High levels of inflammatory cytokines could contribute to the arrhythmic events.  For remdesivir, favipiravir, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, anakinra, baricitinib,  and monoclonal antibodies (bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and casirivimab), no  evidence supports significant effects on cardiac ion channels, changes in the QT  interval, and increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Conclusion: This study  supports the concept of hERG channel promiscuity. Different drug classes given to  COVID-19 patients might delay repolarization, and increase the risk of  ventricular arrhythmias. The presence of comorbid pro-arrhythmic disease states,  and elevated levels of pro-arrhythmic cytokines, could increase the risk of  ventricular arrhythmias. Discontinuation of nonessential drugs and correction of  electrolyte abnormalities could prevent severe ventricular arrhythmias.  Altogether, the most effective therapies against COVID-19 (remdesivir,  dexamethasone, monoclonal antibodies) lack pro-arrhythmic activity.

AB  - A visible light-promoted, efficient, green, and sustainable strategy has been adopted to unlatch a new pathway toward the synthesis of a library of medicinally  important 4,4'-(arylmethylene)bis(1H-pyrazol-5-ols) moieties using substituted  aromatic aldehydes and sterically hindered 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazoline-5-one  in excellent yield. This reaction shows high functional group tolerance and  provides a cost-effective and catalyst-free protocol for the quick synthesis of  biologically active compounds from readily available substrates. Synthesized  compounds were characterized by spectroscopic techniques such as IR, (1)HNMR,  (13)CNMR, and single-crystal XRD analysis. All the synthesized compounds were  evaluated for their antiproliferative activities against a panel of five  different human cancer cell lines and compared with Tamoxifen using MTT assay.  Compound 3m exhibited maximum antiproliferative activity and was found to be more  active as compared to Tamoxifen against both the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines  with an IC(50) of 5.45 and 9.47 μM, respectively. A molecular docking study with  respect to COVID-19 main protease (M(pro)) (PDB ID: 6LU7) has also been carried  out which shows comparatively high binding affinity of compounds 3f and 3g (-8.3  and -8.8 Kcal/mole, respectively) than few reported drugs such as ritonavir,  remdesivir, ribacvirin, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and  olsaltamivir. Hence, it reveals the possibility of these compounds to be used as  effective COVID-19 inhibitors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate COVID19 patients' clinical characteristics, risk factors, and COVID-19 severity at baseline and over one month following hospitalization.  DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study of 598 Saudi  COVID19 patients recruited from 4 major medical institutions nationwide between  June 01, 2020, and February 28, 2021. Patients were stratified into different  demographic characteristics and COVID-19 severity scale. RESULTS: Of the 598  hospitalized adult COVID19 patients (mean [range] age, 57 [46 to 65] years; 59%  male), 300 (50.16%) had severe clinical COVID-19. Comorbidity was high among  hospitalized patients (73.5 %), with diabetes mellitus (n=; 46%) and hypertension  (n=; 41%) being the most common prevalent. In a multivariate logistic regression  model, patient demographics and clinical factors such as age (odds ratio [OR],  1.014 per year; 95% CI, 1.003-1.025), male sex (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.02-2.62),  diabetes mellitus (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.06-2.49), obesity (OR, 1.93; 95% CI,  1.26-2.94), oxygen saturation<92% (OR, 4.83; 95% CI, 2.96-7.86), and high  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (OR, 3.74 per unit; 95% CI, 1.96-7.14) were  independently associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Moreover, more than 60%  of male patients and middle-aged patients (40-60 years) were associated with the  use of COVID-19 medications, including favipiravir and dexamethasone, during  their hospital stay. Additionally, the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation  was the highest in female patients (61.5%) and in middle-aged patients (46.2%).  However, the death rate was slightly higher in males (56%) than in female  patients and in elderly patients (52%). In Cox proportional analysis, age  associated with increased risk of 60-days mortality (Hazard ratio; HR, 1.05 per  year; 95% CI, 1.018-1.098). Additionally, the Riyadh region associated with more  COVID-19 cases required invasive respiratory support (57.7%) and Jeddah was  associated with more deceased COVID-19 cases (44%). CONCLUSIONS: The data shows  that comorbidity is associated with hospitalization among COVID-19 patients,  which indicates the level of severity. Infection during the winter season  (November), male gender, elderly, and those with pre-existing diabetes mellitus  or obesity were associated with higher COVID-19 clinical severity.

AB  - Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) can occur after infection with Hantavirus which can occur by inhaling aerosolized rodent urine, feces, and  saliva contaminated with the virus. It presents with the rapid development of  pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and cardiogenic shock with the hallmark  being microvascular leakage. We report a patient with a history of alcohol abuse  and recent exposure to mice and sick kittens who presented with cough with sputum  production, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and new-onset lower extremity edema.  Imaging revealed bilateral infiltrates more common on the left with an  unremarkable echocardiogram. Testing for COVID-19, Human Immunodeficiency Virus  (HIV), influenza, bacterial pneumonia including tuberculosis and  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), aspergillosis,  histoplasmosis, Blastomyces, and Coccidiodes was negative. Bronchoscopy and  bronchoalveolar lavage revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and were  negative for acid-fast bacilli and Nocardia cultures. He was further tested for  Hantavirus, Q fever, leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, and empiric treatment with  doxycycline initiated. His Hantavirus IgM antibody came back positive. Human  Hantavirus infection occurs after inhalation of infected rodent excreta;  fortunately, human-to-human transmission has not been documented. HCPS most  commonly occurs due to the Sin Nombre virus (SNV), has a case fatality rate of  50%, and is a notifiable disease in the United States. It has 3 distinct phases,  prodromal, cardiopulmonary, and convalescent/recovery. The cardiopulmonary phase  occurs from increased permeability of pulmonary capillaries and in severe cases  can progress to cardiogenic shock. Diagnosis is based on the presence of IgM and  IgG Hantavirus antibodies. Treatment is mainly supportive; however, patients are  usually treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics while workup is underway. In  animal models, ribavirin and favipiravir are only effective when administered in  the prodromal phase. If suspicion of Hantavirus infection exists, early  mobilization to the intensive care unit for treatment is recommended.  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been suggested to improve outcomes  in severe HCPS with refractory shock.

AB  - The effects of eight oral anti-coronavirus drugs (lopinavir, ritonavir, chloroquine, darunavir, ribavirin, arbidol, favipiravir, oseltamivir) on the  metabolism of four specific glycosides (polydatin, geniposide, quercitrin,  glycyrrhizin) and on the activities of three major glycosidases (β-glucosidase,  α-rhamnosidase, β-glucuronidase) from gut microflora were explored in vitro and  determined by LC-MS/MS. The metabolism of polydatin, geniposide, quercitrin and  glycyrrhizin was significantly inhibited by one or several anti-coronavirus drugs  of 100 μM around 1 h and 4 h (P<0.05), among which darunavir could strongly  reduce the production of genipin (70.6% reduction), quercitin (80.6% reduction)  and glycyrrhetinic acid (37.9% reduction), which may cause a high risk of  herb-drug interactions (HDI). Additionally, chloroquine reduced the production of  genipin and quercitin by more than 75% (P<0.05), whereas arbidol had no  significant influence on the metabolism of polydatin, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin  (P>0.05) so that its risk may be lower. The inhibition of darunavir on  β-glucosidase was relatively strong (IC(50) = 193±23 μM), and the inhibition  became weaker on β-glucuronidase and α-rhamnosidase (IC(50)>500 μM). The  consistency between gut microflora and glycosidase system indicated that the  inhibition of darunavir on the activity of β-glucosidase and β-glucuronidase may  be the main reason for affecting the metabolism of geniposide, glycyrrhizin and  polydatin in gut microflora. However, for the inhibition of darunavir and  chloroquine on the metabolism of quercetrin, there was no correlation between gut  microflora and α-rhamnosidase system. Assessing the risk of HDI mediated by  glycosidases in gut microflora may be conducive to the safety and efficacy of  combining traditional herbal and Western medicine for the treatment of patients  with Covid-19.
